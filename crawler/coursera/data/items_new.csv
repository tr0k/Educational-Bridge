We are not going to use those American President Obama, or those, you know president thing. Traditionally, when people are doing lecture in speech-making, they mention or they use a lot of materials form those presidents, but I dont. Who are the models? I would say during the whole course, would you probably say Yang Lan, Yang Lan is an expert in making foreigners understand Chinese very well. If you have ever listened to her speech when she was doing the bidding for the Olympic Games, some of you guys did, and you will find out that she is quite good at this. You know, many Chinese students are lack of those international perspective When they mention something about Tang Dynasty, about Han Dynasty, the foreign listerners don't know what they are talking so you need to refer to what century it is, how many years you may need measuring unit It may change, and so on We need to speak English in that way. Yan Lan does a great job in this You probably have ever listened to Eric Lee, a person that doesn't get known by most people but he gained the Yearly Best Speaker in 2013 Why? The foreigners need to learn about China, but most Chinese are silent, I mean, he is a good talker, he had education in UC Berkeley, he was once an investor, he was doing Venture Capital (VC), he was doing Venture Capital (VC) and I believe, he is among a few guys who can really explain to foreigners how China works, especially in terms of personnel, how colleague is promoted, and how the leader is selected. She is quite good at communicating with foreigners The most importantly, using the way the foreigners can accept. in a way that is easily accepted by foreigners The main reason is that he uses lots of data and chartsto show the foreigners how China is running she also thinks Most westerners believe democracy is good, is supremely good, is good than any other system and then Chinese people believe. Socialism this is the final event, the result of human society would be socialism, something or communism. But here you will, if you listen to his speech, you will find out that he was really talking by data, by hard facts, and let those westerners know more about Chinese system, and in this, he makes a good communication world. Even non English majors can make a talk show in white house, This is a Chinese, who can host the talk show in the white house is a Ph.D who majors in biochemistry He can make a talk show in his Chinese English and he did very successfully, so we can see that Chinese can also do what westerners do and certainly we can learn a lot from others TED talkers, and more importantly, who is most important in this course, is not those speakers, not me the lecturer, is about you. And by this, I mean, the final target is to make you progress, is one day you can make a presentation, a speech very easily. And for that, I would like to say one day, you get to say to yourself, yes, I can! yes, but how? Here comes the methodology. Ok. How may we build up our English speech or presentation skills? This is the way we can follow, I believe to make a good one, the first important thing is not the language you use, is perspective. I think the perspective is the most important how to locate yourself Where you put yourself in a lecture how do you think of those receivers especially, when there is a International group how do you express what you want to say in a way that other cultures can accept. this global perspective I mention it by the way, is not called international perspective in most cases International is misused a lot The foreigners seldom use the word, International They use globle You need to have a global perspective. It is through a global perspective to look at what we say Secondly, you need experience, if you dont have direct experience, experience would be indirect, observation. if you dont have direct experience, experience would be indirect, observation. then you draw a conclusion and analyze it We analyze whay they do a good job and how they express in a humorous way how they draw all people's attention while just starting a speech We also need to learn how to make a thought-provoking conclusion in the end something that you can savour after the speech We are going to learn all these and I also think that before writing a speech, How deep, how wide, is your thought. How deep, how wide,is your thought determines your speech content Whether you have critical thinking, critical thinking, The westerners say a lot about this, but many Chinese don't care about that Actually, when we say something, there is critical thinking In fact, you make some judgement without thinking so foreigners may think you are not so rigirous when Chinese talk. I would like to tell you that in an English interview, no matter for a job or for overseas study even in the personal statements when writing all those things, actually, many foreign teachers, they want to see critical thinking in it in these materials Of course, all these will be reflected in your speech your language I think this is the most suitable position for language itself. there is where it should be It is the ability of your spoken English I use this word there not the ability of spoken-English but spoken-English in yourspeech what does this mean? English speech use what kind of language? Written English? Or totally spoken English? which one? you can have a guess. neither of them It is semi-spoken language and semiformal this is its style We also need to know some body language Otherwise, even you make a wonderful speech, but you will feel a little unhappy because you see an Indian is keeping shaking his head But actually, it is a way of showing approval so you need to know some body languages Also, sometimes, we will make some gesture, like this, which is not acceptable in many cultures but you see many people just do it to show he is cool This is the cultural differences you need to pay attention to body language There are some technique some assistant means technically the ppt We saw it just now Even the African kid in Tanzania can do a good PPT very simple, with certain pictures but this can help you speak out a lot of things picture can say a thousand words picture can say a thousand words There are more Visual aids namely the data we use some pictures, some data We should be aware of the fair use of these things This is one of the major reasons that make your speech more acceptale This course is divided into two stages stage1 ,we will focus on those essential skills: pronunciation, intonation, the culture differences between China and the other countries. How you may use appropriate, powerful English language, how you put up your global perspective in your speech, how you may use those data or digraphs to support your argument. I mean, these are all necessary essential skills, they can be used to many scenarios, many applications And then in stage 2, we focus on something scenarios, like doing an introduction, a formal one, informer one, or half former, whatever, you need a lot of self-introduction, different styles, and the one figure told me that in your whole life, actually, when you speak English, especially for Chinese, 95% of the time when you speak English, you are doing self-introduction... 95% English speakers are making self-introduction when they speak English Interviews. Actually, we have a very high demand for interviews, even for getting a job or for oversees studies. And sometimes, your interview, in your presentation, you need to introduce a company, or the organization you are working for, sometimes you need to tell about your program, or some kind of activities, like campaign, whatever, sometimes, you need to tell about a product, to make an introduction to a certain new technology, I believe, all these have many applications, have more applications in the future and we follow this way, that is something we can manage it. If we prepare in this way, then it will become an operable thing And in the future probably, we will talk about how to make a good biz plan in English, and some ceremonial address, academic report and even election speech. That is not for this semester,... We may have more other classes in this respect The learning procedure is like this, you study in the beginning, and you observe, and then you make your own practice, I need to reinforce that you need to do a lot of practices, so you may come to my lectures, and listen to this video, but if you dont do the homework, there wont be anything good. Ok? There wont be anything good result for this. I simply tell a joke, this is a very practical one, back in the year, when I was a coach in New Oriental, you know, I was coaching on TOFEL reading and writing, so that means I was talking a lot in class. And outside the classroom, there was an old lady, who was selling miner water, and she liked my lectures very much, and actually, she listened to my lectures like a hundred of times, so one day I made a joke, dear aunt, if one day I was so busy that I cant come to the class, could you take my place? and she said yes. And I mean, if one day she really had to take my place, well, can she? Maybe not, maybe yes. But if we ask her to go to the tests, definitely, she will fail. So whats the lesson here? There is no connection between how many times you listen to the class and the actual result you make An water-selling anty who listen to my class 100 times can replace me and give a lesson to students but she is doomed to fail in the examination room for TOEFL The same rule applies here. So when I assign you homework, do like it, do enjoy it. And also, this is not like the class with feedback, thanks to Coursera platform, you can enjoy some feedback from your peers and also from me. If you supplement your recording, your homework, than I can review it. And you can see it. And you can have some comments from your fellow classmates, and this is super important. In the end, if you fulfill, finish all those homework, you are entitled to get a certificate, a statement of compliment to certify that you have successfully completed this course, and good news is that is accepted by many organizations, especially issued by Coursera.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/qualitative-methods/lecture/8zBFr/1-4-epistemology","1.4 Epistemology","After discussing ontology, now it's time to discuss epistemology, and again, we are talking about an elephant. This elephant is about the question, what is knowledge and how do we actually gain knowledge? So if there's a reality out there, as we would discuss in ontology, we now pose the second question and the second question is, how can we understand reality? Or can we understand reality or do we need to measure reality? And usually in text books, there's a distinction made between either a positive view or a more interpretivist view. And this is one way of putting it. The core of it at least is that we can apply natural science methods to social sciences, and it starts with the pretty empiricist point of view. Which means all the knowledge we gain, we gain it through the senses. So everything should be observable and measurable. A second element of positivism is that it's usually deductivist which means that we are testing theories and I will explain a bit about that later. But some would say that positivism also means inductivist. So, its focused on theory building, and there are different strands of positivism, logical positivism. One is mainly focusing on theory building, inductively, whereas hypothetical deductivists, positivists are focusing much more on deductivism. A fourth element of positivism is the focus on objectivity or at least value free researcher. As a researcher you do not try to pose your subjective view of the world, no, you try to establish an objective view of the world. And then lastly. But related is that there is a huge distinction between scientific and normative statements. So, as scientists, we try to do scientific statements rather than normative statements. Positivism in quality research is quite often used not only as a label to apply to these elements of positivism. But it's very often used as a terrible nickname. Actually, you can curse someone saying oh, that's quite positivist. And people wouldn't like that. No one calls him or herself a positivist in qualitative research. So it has quite a negative connotation. Now the other view on epistemology is interpretivist epistemology. When people discuss this interpretivist epistemology, usually people would quote Schutz saying something about people are not atoms, nor are people billiard balls. So, when I hit you, you wouldn't react like a billiard ball. No, you would use your meaning. And this is what Schutz said. Social reality has a specific meaning and relevance structure for the beings living, acting, and thinking within it. So, if I push you, you will act different from other people and why? Well because the meaning you give to that little push is different and every time I push you and when I push you smilingly or very angrily, there's a huge differences. People interpret the world out there. They're not atoms. They're not billiard balls. In an interpretivist epistemology the focus lies with the meaning of social action, it lies with Verstehen in Weber's words, trying to understand subjectively and that's also the last point. The actor's perspective, a subjective reality. An interpretivist tries to see the world from the eyes of the researched, or the people in the study. This is a nice dichotomy, but as you can see, way too simple. Because, in practice, in science, we use different dimensions. We use positivism versus interpretivism as a shortcut. But if we just create some more dimensions, we can see one dimension is objectivity versus subjectivity. Or some would say, as objectivity in itself is a goal rather than something we can accomplish. Intersubjectivity versus subjectivity, now that's one way of looking at knowledge. How do we get at knowledge? Objectively, intersubjectively or subjectively, how do we gain knowledge? Well through verstehen. Understanding from within, trying to get a subjective reality, trying to get into the meaning people attach to different actions. Or through explanation. A leads to B, and B leads to C. Something like that. So causality, and what is the cause of what. And we can see a dimension here. Different views on how do we gain knowledge. A third dimension can be this dimension. How do we get knowledge? By verification. Every time we see a white swan we would say there's another white swan. It helps us create the theory that all swans are white. And in falsification we try to test that theory. Now the fourth dimension, and now you see that this image, this graph, becomes impossible. The fourth dimension is empirical, a focus on the senses, focus on observing empirically versus rational or the idea that we have to sit down and ponder and wonder about social reality and we have to theorize rather than observe. Now as you can see this is an impossible graph. This is just another simplification again, because we could add more dimensions, more ways of knowing. Every research is somewhere in between. In every research, Verstehen is taking place, as well explanation is taking place. So we cannot put, Positivism in either one of these corners. We cannot put interpretivism in either one of these corners. It's way too complex because every positivist does a little verification and a little falsification, probably. And there's quite some positivist research on subjective meaning. And every researcher doing empirical research, whether positivist or interpretivist, is somewhere in this corner. So again, this is a simplification. But at least it's way more complex than using this very simple dichotomy. Now, falsification. If we see one white swan, we would say, okay, there's one white swan. If we see another white swan, we would say, okay, maybe all swans are white. And then if you have seen several white swans, you can say, well, every swan is white. Now, that is verification, and then falsification is not looking the other way when a black swan [SOUND] moves in. Because, in falsification, the idea of Popper and others was that, in science, you try to test a theory. So you say all swans are white, and assume as a black swan swims in we would ring the bells of victory because our theory is refuted. This is one, just one, dimension of epistemology. How do we get our knowledge? Well, probably through falsification. But probably also in many other ways.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/ell-lesson/lecture/Kjeyc/classroom-application-grammar-language-functions","Classroom Application-Grammar & Language Functions","[MUSIC] Hi, and welcome back to lesson planning with the ELL In mind. Today we are excited to take a look at the next classroom application for pre-planning, with a focus on grammar and language functions. Today's lesson should answer the question, how can I make teaching grammar and language functions meaningful? In the last video, we covered how to identify the grammar and language needs for your ELL student. Now how do you go about planning to teach it? How do you make it work for your students, and how to they make it work for the application in your content? We're going to take a look at a couple of ways that have been proven successful for ELL students in the content classroom. The key aspect in teaching grammar and language functions is planning activities and preparing materials that increase student talk time. Or the time that students are actually producing language either in peer conversation, whole class discussion, or individual presentation. Most of this can be encouraged by partner and small group work. This can be easily written into your lesson plan and carefully guided in your activities. Brainstorming and activation techniques can help initiate awareness of grammatical structures and language functions needed for the lesson. Remember that students are negotiating the structures and meaning while talking to their peers. Any increase in interactions such as response partners and assigned roles within an assignment can further students' awareness of grammatical structures and language functions necessary for the lesson. Pre-planning questions will ensure that you are asking more open-ended questions, thus allowing for more language production and student talk time. Finally, planning time for students to reflect will give them an opportunity to notice any struggles with the grammar and language functions learned and practiced in the day's lesson. Writing and speaking frames are two great techniques for supporting your ELL students and their access to grammar and language functions. Writing and speaking frames allows students to demonstrate knowledge of material with supported language structures. In the pre-planning stages, after designating the grammar and language support needed for the output required by the assignment. You can sketch speaking or writing frames as seen here. This is an example from a language arts class lesson on Mark Twain. The student can complete their research about Mark Twain and then complete the writing frame to demonstrate what they learned. These can be tailored to the student's level of support needed and language abilities. These are just a couple of ideas for preparing your ELL students with the necessary grammar and language structures in order to participate in your day's lesson. We will continue to explore these ideas in detail throughout the course.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-holocaust/lecture/kqe7Q/1-3-1-expectations-of-reality","1.3.1 Expectations of reality","What is it that we read when we read about Holocaust material? One of my arguments that's overarching Is that the experience of the Holocaust has changed modern literature and that all literature since then deals with a subject matter that changes the literary form that we deal with in modern literature. And one of the bits of evidence I have of that is the kind of material that has been written about, the Holocaust, and the different forms, the different genres Now, part of my job here is to transform all of you into students of literature. Something you all need to know about even if you are going to be bioinformatics engineers That is, literary forms are something that we all engage in all the time When we go back and tell our roommate about what kind of a day we had. In other words. We're always making narratives. We're always telling stories. And you should know the kinds of stories I got for why you need to be in this class. Narratives. I'm interested in narratives. And there are all kinds of Holocaust narratives. [INAUDIBLE] And the literary genres all have expectations. The expectations are what we expect when my roommate comes back, and I say, what was your afternoon like? And the roommate says, well, I spent it upside down at the gym doing head-stands. But they're all kinds of narratives and we anticipate usually what is known as a realistic narrative. With the literary genre of realism but all of you know that there are many other kinds of expectations. You read science fiction and you have that funny moment of expectation Realistic experience, but the person telling you has green eyes and horns and a tail or a luminous face. In other words, the question of literary genre involves reader expectations, or, like film, viewer expectations. When your roommate tells you what kind of a day he had doing headstands you don't expect that he'll suddenly transform. Or maybe she will. I don't know. But Holocaust writing appeared in all the genres, the different kinds of writing. It appeared in diary, Anne Frank. It appeared in memoirs, Elie Wiesel's. It appeared in ethnography, Nechama Tec, Dry Tears. It appeared in historical writing. I wanna come back to The difference between historical writing and other literary genres. And historical writing is also a literary form, and we're very lucky to have Peter with us to prove that historians not only go to the archives and make. General narratives from the individual narratives they read about in the archives. But he's also written an autobiography, a personal narrative. So we have a question of realistic narratives about Well you can say there are strange experiences that the Holocaust involved. There are extraordinary experiences. There are surrealistic experiences. But, you know, those are ways of Telling us that something different is going on in what is being told about. Something out of the ordinary. And this is one of the problems of [FOREIGN]. They have these problems because they, themselves do not believe what is happening, and they haven't read the story yet, right? So they don't know what the end will be. By the way, think about it this way. What if you knew the ending? If you had read the ending first. But these people do not, of course however, when historians write about these issues when they constructed historical narrative. There's suspense about what's going to happen. But the historians know what the ending is. Or where the conclusion will be. And they don't mind usually. To let you know and that you know. And they write therefore, and this is grammar. I hate this grammar, but grammar is much different and bigger than you think. They write in a tense, a verbal tense like the past tense. This happened and that happened and this caused it and so on. So we can talk about the historical past. As the tense. But that's not why you read diaries. Diaries aren't written in the past exactly. They're all about, it just happened. And memoirs, it just happened. And fiction is all about giving you the present-ness of experience and having the presence of those unfolding experiences before you without knowing, without the teleology of an ending. Big word teleology, I'll explain it later if you want me to But you can all Google. So that literary genres differ in terms of reader expectation, in terms of what you know and what you experience. So the writer has this question of how to communicate ongoing present experience if the writer is a novelist. But not if he's a historian. The historian wants to tell you this happened and that happened. Right? The historical past, even if it's written in the past tense in fiction, there is a way in which the writer does something to make it present. And, one of the ways, is that, literary fiction often has a first person narrator, whereas there are few histories that are written with a first person narrator. But rather a general objective in quotes because it isn't. Narrator telling you about many experiences that are general. Whereas the first person narrator, dry tears. it's her ethnography, it's her memoir, she tells you her own personal experience, and so if you started to read it, there's a moment, maybe I can find it, but let me just tell you what it is, there's a moment at which The family factory has been locked up. Jews are not allowed to own factories any more according to the Nazi regime. And she goes to the factory and it's locked up. And she realizes there is someone inside. That is not Nehama but her mother. And her mother goes and wants to open the lock because she thinks someone has been locked in there. And the Nazi guard comes up to her, and Nehama has to describe the fact that the guard responds Is to start hitting her mother. And so, like good Californians. Like well fed, strong Americans. Our response would be, she must hit him back. But Nehama then says, my mother knew she could not do anything but accept the blows, and she covers her head. Which is where the guard is, the Nazi is busy Whacking her. Finally, he gets tired and the mother's response is, this is a terrible thing to think about, she's completely passive. None of us want to be passive When attacked. Right? But here is mother, knowing that she's, in one sense powerless, and in another sense able to refuse. To participate. Exactly. By being passive. There is a whole sequence of issues that her narrative raises. And Nehama is Discovering this in her own persona as the book progresses. She is learning something about what it means to be powerless. And she is learning something about resisting even though you are powerless. I think this is a key moment in the book and in our questioning about what the holocaust was about. And this of course will be something Peter and I will have a chance to talk about.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-holocaust/lecture/3GgBU/1-3-4-on-account-of-a-hat","1.3.4 On Account of a Hat","On account of a hat. Is it in focus? Can you read that at all? Did I hear you say absent-minded? They were already talking. And he starts in the middle of the conversation. He's gonna tell us about someone who is absent-minded. And tells you about his town. And he says, Mr. Shalom Aleichem, do you hear what I say? You could go on writing it down but if you could spare a moment I'll tell you a story, About what happened to Sholom Shuchat on a Passover eve, a story about a hat. And then to make sure Shalom Aleichem believes him, a true story, I should live so even if does sound like someone made it up. What a trick this is, but it's a trick to keep us listening. It's a true story, but it sounds like someone made it up. Now we are in a dialogue, and the dialogue is about this, well, he's a luftmensch. A luftmensch is someone, surely you know some Yiddish or some German. A luftmensch is some who lives on air. That is, he doesn't quite have a profession or a job. And he's wiggled his way into getting a cut of a real estate deal because of this and that, finders fees, all of that kind of stuff. And he's so excited that he writes home. He sends a telegram, because this is the modern world. There are railroads and telegrams. He says, coming home for Passover without fail. But the narrators, the cigarette merchant, has told Shalom Aleichem, the narrator, sorry about a hat. A hat. Some of you have noticed that I wear a hat. And who wears a hat? And you all know that pious Jews always keep their heads covered. It's a sign of their piety, and this is about a hat. So right away some things are happening in the story make us ask, what about a hat is involved here? Well, you get the story in your e-comments. I am eager to have you read it and I know people have said, there's so much reading in this course! Okay, another story, but you know you could force your, Roommate to listen to. That's a nice thing to hear the voice. Because, in the story, we hear a voice. That's also a mark of great fiction versus other kinds of writing. Shalom Shothna made a deal. He's coming home without fail, he's a poor guy, he sent the money home that he could spare, he buys some present. It's Passover eve and now he has to get home from where he made the deal. He was out in and they made a deal. Now he has to get to Santa Cruz, but there's a railroad. And that was local references, you may not know what is. He needs to get on the railroad. The problem is, he has to make a connection. He takes one railroad and then he has to get on a train to. And the problem is that the next train is in the morning and he's arrived after the last train left. So there he is in the railroad station, and he's been up two nights travelling home, you know. He tried to get on the bus in Santa Fe, but there was no room. And he goes into the station and he's dead tired and he wants to take a nap. So he looks around and there's one bench, and on the bench is sitting someone wearing a uniform. In Russia of the 19th century you wear a uniform if you're anybody, and this guy, because he's a somebody, spread out, right, on the chair, on the bench. So, Shalom Shothna doesn't know what to do and he suddenly has this thought, this guy. He's wearing a uniform, so there's buttons, not like mine that are about to fall off, buttons, like fancy buttons. This guy, there were rumors there's a great anti-semitic agitator around. This guy could be him. What shall I do? Then he pulls himself together and says I to have a right. I'm gonna buy a ticket to sit on the bench. He sits on the bench finally. And he hadn't slept for two nights, he says, I'll just lean back. Then he suddenly realizes he might sleep through the next train, and if he doesn't get the next train, he doesn't get home for Passover. So he jumps up, and he gets the porter, and he says, wake me up for the train, gives him a little coin. No problem, says the porter. So he goes back and he says, I'll just take a nap, so I'll be awake for the train. You've had this experience, haven't you? And in five minutes, he's snoring away. Snoring away so much that the hat that covers his head, as a sign that he's Jewish, falls off his head. He has a dream, but it's really the porter waking him up to the train coming. He doesn't know what to do. Finally, he wakes up, looks for his hat, puts it on his head, rushes to the ticket window. The crowds around the ticket window part like magic. He rushes to the ticket window, he says I'd like a ticket and the ticket taker says, yes your excellency, what would you like? Third-class. What do you mean? You're making jokes. A Jew doesn't travel first-class, or second, third class. All right, Your Excellency. Gives him a third-class ticket. In the meantime, he's bought things to take home, and he's got this bag with him, and he's been clutching it, and he says, so, now I've gotta find a place on the train, and he rushes out. And he's about to get in the third-class carriage when he stops someone and says, is this third class? And the conductor says, yes, Your Excellency, but you don't want to go in there, there's no room, come. And he takes him along. And Shalom Shothna is sure everybody is making jokes. Well, and he's following the guy who's grabbed his bag, right? He's helping him, because your excellency doesn't carry a bag. Someone carries it for him. It's what happens when Peter and I go anywhere. Everybody takes our bags. [LAUGH] Oh, is this the Democratic California? Sorry. So finally, he goes into the first class, never been in there before, and there's a seat for him, and he's got his bag, and he happens to look in the mirror. And he realizes that the porter woke up the wrong guy, because when he looks in the mirror he sees the button's hat on his head, cuz everybody lost their hat while they were sleeping, and he picked up the wrong hat. And Shalom Shothna has this moment, which is hilarious, where he says the dumb porter woke up the wrong guy! I have to get off the train now and wake up Shalom Shothna, who's asleep on the bench. So he jumps, wakes up the other guy who isn't there anymore, and of course misses the train. And therefore has to spend Passover with strangers, and our narrator says, you know, that's the least of it. Then there's this says to the cigarette mechant, I have a wife, you have a wife, we've all had a taste of paradise. And Shalom Shothna has a wife. And when he gets home, she lets him have it. And she isn't only concerned that he missed Passover with his kids, it took him longer. She says, you sent a telegram that said, coming home for Passover without fail. I don't know how you tell people you're gonna do something, but religious Jews, no. What Woody Allen tells us, you wanna make God laugh, make plans. So, religious Jews say, God willing, I'll be home for Passover. You can't rely on the train, right? Or there's higher powers. Boy, does his wife let him have it. Why am I telling you this story? Because Shalom Shothna has, in the train, with the hat, a moment when he doesn't know who he is. The story is brilliant. Is he Shalom Shothna, the modern entrepreneur, or is he Shalom Shothna, the little Jew, who maybe is just making it? I hope, which is he? He's lost his identity, and the evidence of that is he runs off to wake himself up on the bench. This is what is known in literary critical circles as a peripeteia. The moment of the turning, I can give you all kinds of fancy words. Common tenses is the buildings but later. So, Shalom Shothna is a Jew caught between the modern and the traditional. And he's caught there and he cannot take advantage of being modern. He cannot pass. Now that's something you all know about. Passing. You all experience this when you go to a party in. And you don't wanna be singled out as a prestige student, so you dress differently. >> [LAUGH] >> And you talk a little classics. Right, pass. Passing is what we all do, and we all understand that our identities are about role playing, the modern experience. Shalom Shothna cannot do this. He cannot do this, he can't pass. He can't take advantage. It's offered to him, it's not working. He panics, and rushes off the train to wake himself up. So one of things that Sholom Aleichem is doing in that story is talking about identity crisis, something you're all interested in. Identity crises in the transition to the modern world. Now this is a very funny story and the cigarette merchant says, you know when we got home, his wife buried him alive with his aria on without fail. They were trying to make the telegraph company rich, pay for every word without fail you said and of course, that's to be very modern. He wasn't being traditional. But that's the least of what happens to Shalom Shothna, because somehow the whole town knows about this, and from then on in the town wherever he goes, the young kids, your younger brothers and sisters, they say oh here comes your excellency. Now there's a whole set of issues around names. And Shalom Shothna was given a new name because of what he was wearing on his head. Now, that's the name that sticks with him. But, because this is a story about Shalom Aleichem, what we experience is the irony. He couldn't take advantage of the name Your Excellency. He could only, Repudiate it. And yet he got the advantage, he bought the ticket. He didn't have to stand on line, he got a seat, all of that. How come this young man couldn't pass? So, this is gonna be a big theme. This is, after all, a theme that's central to Nahamates. Nahamates will pass. She supports her family. She saves them, because she passes. How does she pass? By speaking unaccented Polish, by looking Aryan, so too her sister, whereas her parents, their Polish isn't that good, and her mother looks Jewish, dark eyes, dark hair. And Nahamates saves your family, because she can pass. So here's another theme for you to look at throughout the reading. So I'm going to stop here for a moment because Peter and I have an agreement. >> We give each other five minutes for marginal comments. About the Shalom Aleichem story, I think it's a wonderful story illustrating that this is ado of acculturation. And I think this is an excellent illustration of the point I was trying to make the day before yesterday. Murray was talking about history and literature. And I am struck by how much the two are alike rather than how different they are, inasmuch as we learn about human beings. Now, historians deal not only about individuals' innate, not mostly about individuals, but about also institutions, but the ultimate lessons are the same. Now to be sure, we have to follow different rules, such things that are footnotes or archives. But our ultimate interest is the human experience. >> Peter, policing universals. I believe in communities, I think we are similar but we are different. He is a man of the enlightenment. >> I so much hope so. >> [LAUGH]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-holocaust/lecture/VAjUz/1-3-3-yiddish-culture","1.3.3 Yiddish culture","I want to go to Yiddish culture, because the whole issue of how mother knows that she can resist, while being passive, while accepting the blows, which is a theme, is also central to Yiddish culture, to Jewish culture, as a culture of resistance in general. So, a culture that teaches people about being different from the usual stuff of European culture. And Peter elaborated how the Jews were, and continue to be, different, last time. And that difference turns out to be very important as the world becomes modern. There are a whole bunch of passages from the that I want you to look at in particular, as well as to read the whole book! And they are part of what I sent around as an announcement to eCommons. And I also sent a copy of this story by Shalom Aleichem, but I want to talk a little bit about Yiddish culture, the culture of Eastern European and Jews. Part of their difference is that they spoke a different language. A language called Yiddish. A fusion language. That's a technical term for the linguists among us. A fusion language that, on the armature of some German dialect, and the use of much Hebrew, becomes a language that the Jews spoke. We have a text from the 12th century in Yiddish. So it's a language that's got a long history, and there are even classes in it here. Hebrew, the language in which God created the universe, according to the Bible, both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Bible. Hebrew is an intellectual language. That is, it was used for intellectual discussions. Think of it as how physicists talk. But it lacked certain things when you got to Europe, it was fine in the Middle East. But even there is became part of another linguistic fusion language, Aramaic. Which some of you have heard about from movies. Aramaic, which is known as the little sister of Hebrew. You go back and forth. And almost all languages that I know of are next to other languages they share, so there are no languages or words in isolation. Yiddish was known as the mamaloshen, a word that is made up of the Hebrew word lashon, tongue, language, and the word mama, which you've probably already guessed. So Yiddish, is the mother tongue. It's the language that Jews use to talk to each other about all the everyday life experiences. When, in the middle of the 19th century, Jews said they had to start writing Hebrew again as part of their nationalism. The first Hebrew novel had a problem, because like novels everywhere, it was about love, but Hebrew doesn't have much in the way of love talk. So, that first novel, by Abraham Mapu, had to turn to the language of the Song of Songs, which is elegant, elevated poetry. And when I was a kid, I thought I would be a failure in talking to women. So I talked to my sisters all the time, but other women, because I couldn't use that fancy language or, my experience was the movies, and there, when the young man wants to talk to the young woman and impress her, he sings! Forget it. >> [LAUGH] >> Right? But Yiddish was the language in which Jews made love. In which they had families, in which they lived everyday life. And Sholem Aleichem, in the middle of the 19th century, as Jews become welcomed more and more, and have access, is part of a group of people who are writing modern literature. And as writers of modern literature, they are breaking with Jewish tradition, because everything has changed. And before that, when Jews wanted to talk about serious subjects, they wrote in Hebrew. And they wrote commentaries on the great texts, commentaries. And when they had fantasies to bring, they did the backstory on Jacob and Esau, Jacob wrestling with the angel, all kinds of things. Very brief in Hebrew. But here is Sholem Aleichem writing literature because there are now newspapers, and the newspapers bring news of new situations, the new experiences of life. And there are newspapers in Yiddish. Sholem Aleichem, like many of us, said well, the big thing is to write in Russian like Tolstoy. So he tries writing in Russian, but he doesn't have many readers. He tries writing in Hebrew, doesn't have many readers. But when he writes in the mamaloshen, suddenly everybody wants to read him. And he becomes one of the great writers to a community. I sent you one story because it's a very special moment, but it's like so many of his stories, tries to deal with what it means to be a traditional society changing into a modern society. So if you want to know about women's lives in the 19th century, Jewish women's lives, you should read Sholem Aleichem. Because women's lives are changing. They're both traditional and modern at the same time. I know, you're young and you believe you should only be one thing. But as you'll get older, you'll know that you'll have to play many roles or maybe you've already learned that. Women, especially, got to this point as industrialization happened, urbanization, all of those experiences. So, here is a story in which Sholem Aleichem is telling us that women's roles change. But how can he tell us a story, using past tense, that gets us to experience it in the present? And again, many young writers only write in the present because that's present and that's our experience of films and so on. Sholem Aleichem has a different understanding. He's telling us that Jews are responding to the new modern world and the old traditional world they live in and they talk to each other. So Sholem Aleichem's stories give us a series of experiences in which two Jews are talking. Not did talk, not talked, past tense, but they're in the process of talking, they're talking about each other And that's the trick of the narrator in this story. Because the narrator doesn't narrate, the narrator does the listening. Now, to listen is an interesting idea and deserves lots of serious discussion. I can only give you a sense of how important listening is by telling you that Isaiah Berlin, a wonderful modern philosopher, told his audience, when he won the Jerusalem Prize, that you need to belong somewhere in order to be able to communicate. That listening and speaking depend upon belonging, and that that's the condition of being understood. So the narrator of Sholem Aleichem's tale, On Account of a Hat, and the speaker, by their listening to each other, are telling us they belong together. And they're telling us that the frame of reference works for both of them. So this is literary analysis, and I hope you'll think about this for all the stories in your lives and all the stories you are inventing. I didn't finish the homework because the dog ate the, whatever. The stories that you're constantly inventing. Sholem Aleichem's narrator meets someone who's a merchant, as he puts it, in snips of paper. Snips of paper. He sells cigarette papers. If you want to know about those, I think there are several smoke shops here in town, you can all get snips of paper. And the narrator tells us that while he tells us this story, he's smoking constantly. And what is he doing? He's saying to Sholem Aleichem, I want to tell you about something extraordinary. Why is it extraordinary? Somewhere I have that. Oh, here. The story.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-holocaust/lecture/XUFQw/1-3-2-hier-ist-kein-warum","1.3.2 Hier ist kein warum","Here we are. Does this come up? Heir ist kein warum? There's a moment in Survival in Auschwitz, and you'll have to understand that my job is very different from Peter's. Peter is telling you a narrative. He's telling you a story. The narrative put together from many, many of these kinds of accounts. A generalized narrative, if you will. An algorithm. I'm asking you to look at individual detail, to make you ask, what are the materials that were put into making such a general narrative? In Survival in Auschwitz, Primo Levi tells us about how he arrives in Auschwitz, more complicated than that. No nothing to drink for the train journey of three and half days, etc. It's winter. He's thirsty. There are icicles on the building they're in. He goes outside, and breaks off an icicle. Very much what all of us would think of doing. The guard takes it away from him. And Primo Levi, who knew a little German because he was a chemistry major and until World War II all chemistry at a higher level was conducted in German, all the textbooks. This was one of the great centers of science. Primo Levi says one word, warum, which is what we would do. Why? Why are you knocking the icicle out of my hand? And the guard's answer is very direct and very clear, and gets at the whole question of expectation, both in the situation and for us the reader. The guard says, hier ist kein warum. Heir ist kein warum. There is no why here. Why is something like this? Now, my job is to get you to see that Primo Levi is making us ask, what kind of a world is this in which a thirsty person is not allowed to use an icicle to slake his thirst? And the Nechama Tec is doing the same thing. What kind of a place is this where a woman who was trying to make sure that someone is not locked in the factory, without food or water, etc., gets beaten for just trying to do that. Heir ist kein warum. So the whole question of expectation comes back to us in a powerful way and this is a theme that will recur. A theme that we cannot avoid. A question about realistic narratives and surrealistic experiences, and how do you communicate them? And neither Nechama Tec nor Primo Levi are willing to do what most of us do when we experience something that outside, the a roommate suddenly turning into an alien, right? It's not what we anticipate, it's not what we have expectation of, it's not what all our education has taught us to expect. And then when you're telling the other roommate, and then my roommate turned into an alien. The roommate would say, that's incredible. Let's leave it at that. They want to do more than say, that's incredible. Primo Levi the chemist. Nechama Tec a world class sociologist who's now a member of the senior staff at the Holocaust Museum in Washington. They believe language can communicate precisely. But the problem is that all the usual ways we use language are now up for grabs because heir ist kein warum. There's no why here. Primo Levi believes in precision. So, too, does Nechama Tec. So, too, I hope you will. But this precision involves things that are counter-factual. I knew you wanted fancy words for this, right? Counter-factual. How can you communicate this. So their work is to get us to think about communication and to think about the difficulties when the experience is not quote unquote realistic. When it is surrealistic, but that isn't even the right word. Because sur, as you know from French, and Spanish and Italian, above realism. Maybe some of this is below. Maybe some of this a totally different frame of reference. What is the frame of reference? For what you read. And we experienced this with the Don Pagis poem where the title told us that it was a contemporary written in pencil in the sealed railway car. And then here in the car load I am Eve. Wait a minute! That's not the usual frame of reference. I don't think any of your roommates tell you, oh, my name is Joshua. You know, I'm the Biblical Joshua. No. That's not acceptable. But in the poem, suddenly something has changed our frame of reference. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pick on any Joshuas in the room. I can use all kinds of other names if you'd like. My Hebrew name is not Biblical, but that's a different problem. So I can't use mine. I could use Peter's. So what is the frame of reference? And this is a matter of narrative structure, narrative process, grammar and also the urge we all have to know how it ends up. Now Nechama Tec lived and this is a story of how she survived. By learning. But, Anne Frank didn't. Frieda Lipschitz didn't. A whole series of other diarists didn't survive. And Primo Levi tells us that he's writing to honor the memory of those who didn't live to tell the story. So it's a very different kind of experience than we usually have and it then engages us in questions of what do we remember? How do we remember it? For what purpose? And for Primo Levi, it's to give voice as much as possible to what he calls the Drowned and the Saved. And then, in faithlessness, we have a voice that also does that, and carries it further than Primo Levi does because he says, I can't give voice to the ones who drowned. I can only go so far, and that's part of the question about how much does our normal frame of reference cut off of the experiences, including the experiences of the Holocaust, and at this point, I need to do a sidebar. And just to say that some of you must know about the surrealistic, strange, extraordinary terrorist incidents in Paris and in France. And I mention these not to you to tell you you should be reading the newspaper and watching the news. But to say that you need to be aware of your surroundings. Your safety. The safety of those you love. But I'll stop for a moment. Hoping I have made this basic distinction clear and then I wanna talk about, well, a great humorist. One of the greatest writers ever.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-holocaust/lecture/ZpIfe/1-2-5-theodor-herzl","1.2.5 Theodor Herzl","To start with the Dreyfus affair. Dreyfus was treated as a traitor and there was a public ceremony where his rank, the epaulets, were stripped from him, his sword was broken and he was sent to prison, Devil's Island. And while this went on as the public ceremony, a journalist who was Hungarian in origin, named Theodor Herzl, who wrote for the major German newspaper, was there. And he was shocked that the crowd yelled, death to the Jews. And this was the rallying cry, it wasn't death to the traitors or to the spies, but death to the Jews. And this leads Theodor Herzl to conclude that if France, the most emancipated, the most enlightened country, has this response the only hope for the Jews is a country of their own. They had been in exile since the Romans destroyed the second Jewish commonwealth in 70 CE. I say CE rather than AD because AD, as you know, is a religious term, right? Anno Domini, the year of our Lord. CE, for me, means Common Era. And I live by a different calendar, as do Muslims, as do Hindus, etc. So Dreyfus invents modern Zionism. So one the effects of the emancipation is the invention of modern Zionism that in 1948 ends up with an independent state of Israel. Now, I wanna correct something that Peter said. Peter said that the United States didn't emancipate, and he meant, it didn't have to emancipate the Jews because the Jews were not singled out. But the United States was founded, as we know in reading the Constitution, about people who are only three-fifths of a person, the African slaves. And the United States had to emancipate the slaves in 1863. And the slaves took upon themselves the notion from Jewish liturgy, that they too were going to have an exodus. And we will remember that one of the effects of African-Americans getting together, emancipated, was to invent a country of their own, which is in existence today and its called Liberia. But I wanna go back to a couple of things Peter said about emancipation. Emancipation for the Jews involved, for the Jews internally, the translation of the Hebrew Bible into a Western language. Not to use Luther's translation into German, but Moses Mendelssohn in the 18th century, translates the Hebrew Bible into German. And now a strange thing happens. Jews who know the Bible in Hebrew read his translation to learn German! And then they can function in German culture. Moses Mendelssohn was a celebrity. As a celebrity, he was given special permission to live in Berlin. He was given special permission to marry. Jews had to ask for permission of the government to marry because they had their place and we don't want to many of them. So we were talking about estates and minorities and everybody in their place, and we know about that, because we know that. We come from situations where people want to keep us in our place, and then we go to university to learn new skills, and then we want to get hired on the basis of what we can do with our skills. And the great figure of this in emancipation is Napoleon, who comes from Corsica, who isn't quite French, it's a French possession, who is a genius. And this notion of the genius. Well for the Jews to succeed, they too have to be geniuses. As you all know, that's what all those TV programs are about, the genius kid who can code like nobody else, right? The programmer. And you might think about the Jews and literacy as if you're thinking about your colleagues, your roommate who knows how to code. So, think that the Jews in the 19th century suddenly could code because they could read and write, and other people couldn't. I wanna come back to the Nazis and Christianity, but I wanna talk now about something that Peter neglects all the time. Jews now dress like everybody else. Jews look just like everybody else. But everybody knows the Jews are still secretly different. And one of the big places where this appears is attitudes to Jewish women. There are famous actresses In France who are jewish. One called Rachel, named after the Jewish matriarch, she didn't have a second name. She didn't need one. Then there's Sarah Bernhardt, who is known as the divine Sarah, celebrities. In other words, you may not take this out of the room. Jewish women are hot. >> [LAUGH] >> Why are they hot? >> They're exotic. >> They're exotic and I've even met non-Jewish women who say, Jewish men are hot. They're exotic. >> I've never heard that. >> He doesn't know any Swedes. >> [LAUGH] >> I know people from Sweden who married, she said, he's exotic! And exotic is now good. Why? Because we don't follow that old Italian proverb, get your oxen and your wife from the same community. In other words, where you were located. We've lost the notion of location. We are mobile. And the city is the most sinful place of all. College, beware. So that's part of what emancipation means. I want now to come to the Nazis, and the question that you've raised, because theology is an undercurrent here, and I'm the one who said Peter, remember the Jews didn't kill Christ, the Romans did. But the Jews were given that stigma for thousands of years. And, therefore they were in exile, they were not allowed to do what other Christians could. By the time of the Nazis, everybody knows that Jesus was a Jew. One of the things the Nazis were interested in was dejudaizing Christianity. So, they published bibles without the Hebrew Bible, which if you look at your bible in the hotel room where you're taking this hot friend, right, you'll see the first part of the bible, most of the bible is the account of the Jews. And Christian Bible rewrites, responds to the Jewish Bible, the Nazis had theologians who said, let's take this out of there. And the first, big Nazi event, Kristallnacht, was all about desecrating, parodying, removing Judaism as well as Jews. Because Christianity without Jews is not possible. Because Jesus, as Peter said quite rightly, was a Jew. So the Nazis are very strange in their attitudes toward Christianity. And though the Nazis would call themselves believers, the content of that belief tended to more to Paganism than to Christianity. And in fact, there is a theologian who has argued that the Holocaust, the killing of six million Jews was an effort to kill Jesus over and over again.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-holocaust/lecture/UgQa9/1-2-4-roots-of-modern-antisemitism","1.2.4 Roots of modern antisemitism","So, France actually had a great deal to do with the development of modern anti-Semitic thought. That is French thinkers, they made the contribution to, well one aspect of this which I didn't mention before is racialism, which is again a very significant intellectual current in the second half of the 19th century. This is a kind of faux Darwinism. This is a kind of bastard Darwinism. Namely that life is struggle and the races struggle against one another and there are superior races and there are inferior races and, mind you, Jews themselves, at that time were not altogether alien to racialist thought. That is, Jews also considered that indeed that humanity is divided into races, and Jews are a different race. For better or worse. And so, in this notion that this, of course, will be a major focal point of Nazi ideology, that life is a struggle among races, and the strong owes nothing to the weak. And you show your racial superiority by defeating the weak. And what I am saying, is that Nazi thought, which will be such an important issue for us, had its antecedents in the course of the 19th century, primarily in France and in Germany. Now we come to the Dreyfus Affair. The Dreyfus case. And I imagine that most of you know the outline of this story of what happened. What happened was that an army officer, a Jewish army officer, Dreyfus was arrested because he was charged with spying for Germany. Now the charge was false. The spy actually was another army officer. By the name of Esterhazy. Now, it's not terribly important, there's no need for you to remember the name of Esterhazy. But it is important for you to remember the name of Dreyfus. What happened was that it became clear that Dreyfus was not the criminal, not the spy. And then France was divided. Now, I am not saying that the case of Dreyfus divided France, the division had already been there. That is those conservative anti modern forces, who celebrated the major French institutions. The church, the army, the royalty, even though of course there was no king anymore. But they wanted to return. They were royalists. Those were anti Dreyfus. Those opposed the liberation on Dreyfus. And so, in no other country in Western Europe there was such a clear division between the friends and enemies of this new world. And it is interesting and very important for us to remember, that the Jews were on one side. Jews were associated with modernity, with all those things. Which many people don't like about modernity. As opposed to the conservative forces, where the Jews had few friends. That is, show me someone who is enthusiastic about the modern world, and I say he's unlikely to be a real antisemite. Now this association of Jews and modernity is not something what the Jews wanted and this is it even it's not something which the Jews caused. The Jews did not make modernity. The Jews were not responsible for industrialization. However, they were in a position to take advantage of industrialization and everything with this modern society could provide. So back to the Dreyfus Affair, Dreyfus ultimately was liberated and the good guys won, so to speak. However, this division between the two Frances would then reappear 40 years later when we come to occupy France and the creation of the Vichy regime. Because the Vichy was really and is often described as the revival of the anti-Dreyfus coalition. Well, that is pretty much what I wanted to say, Murray.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-holocaust/lecture/2B7c5/1-2-3-jews-in-french-society","1.2.3 Jews in French society","Now these four factors, which I am thinking aloud, enable Jewish success in the course of the 19th century. Could also be, and were turned around, by the anti-Semites. Namely, Studying the Torah is splitting hair. Not participating in agriculture where they don't want to do creative work. They don't want to do physical labor. Sticking together, well, they were rootless cosmopolitans. They were not real Frenchmen. They were not real Germans, In which there is some truth in this. And fourthly, of course, users you see, but when you put it all together, what you come up with, from the point of view of the anti-Semite, that the Jews were. Really don't belong to the nation. They take advantage of honest Frenchmen who toils in the countryside and they do not become workers or miners, but they take advantage of the rest of society. And this is serious, a focal point, a central argument of the anti-Semites in the coming years. So why did nations, in this instance France, want to emancipate the Jews? They did not want to emancipate the Jews. They wanted to do away with a state-based society where the Jews had a certain place. And there were serfs. There were nobles. There was the clergy. There was city dwellers and each had defined obligations by rethinking what the nation is. A nation is people who live in the same geographic area, who share historical traditions. Necessitated to do away with this special subgroup, they made the Jews. So the Jews were liberated, no not liberated, emancipated as a side result of what was happening, this great transformation of the coming of modernity in the case of France. Interestingly, the emancipation was well, perhaps not surprisingly, it was not necessarily an easy process. French Jewry consisted of two branches, the Sephardi. The word comes from a Hebrew word for Spain, [FOREIGN]. Who was a smaller community which lived in southwest of France, relatively well off, and the much larger group living mostly in Alsace, Alsace-Lorraine on the German border. Uber Ashkenazi, this is the great division of modern Jewry. Come again, the word comes from Hebrew, Ashkenaz which is a Hebrew name for German, which was a much larger community and much poorer community. And so first, the rules, which applied only to Jews were abolished in concerning the Sephardic community, and only later with a much larger Ashkenazi community in Alsace-Lorraine. And the people in Alsace-Lorraine were not happy about this. There was some resistance, and Napoleon abolished the debt which the Alsace-Lorraine peasants owed to Jews to make the appeal easier. And anti-Semitism goes back to Roman times where the Jews were the most rebellious minority in the Roman world in as much as they refused to accept the Caesars as a god because that went contrary to their religious obligation. And they kept on rebelling until well, we hope. But the point is that antisemitism meant that you disliked Jews because they were responsible for killing of Jesus. The church, by and large, the Catholic church was Catholic anti-Semitism was religiously inspired and was something very important because after all, in medieval society the Jews were pretty much the only others. That is, who are you? I am a Christian. I am a Christian because I believe in Christ, and then there is a group of people who do not believe in Christ. And so consequently, you have to deal with them. But the point which I wanted to convey is that there was dislike of Jews, contempt for Jews for what they were, but not fear of Jews. This is the fear which can be correlated with Jewish success. More successful and at the same time came to look like you and me. And therefore you didn't know. You see as long as they were defined, as long as you know they lived in the ghetto, lived in defined communities, there was no question about it. But this identity, there was no question about Jewish identity before the French Revolution. I mean the issue could not have arisen. But now, well, the Jews are behind it all, whatever because they stick together. Now, My argument is that for us to understand the Holocaust, we have to look at who the Jews were and how they were perceived. Now this isn't obvious, this is not blame the Jews, but it is our task to understand how the anti-Semites thought of the Jews. And again, I know I'm repeating myself, anti-Semitism comes in this enormous variety. That is, a peasant in Alsace-Lorraine who loans money to Jews disliked the Jews, but this is entirely different phenomenon from what the Nazi's were. Christians dislike Jews because they were responsible for the death of Christ. This is a different phenomenon than Nazi anti-Semitism because the Nazis weren't even good Christians. In fact, they were very bad Christians, no matter how you look at it. Instead, we should emphasize that Christ was after all a Jewish boy, And he talked to Jews. Well, I must not go into theology cuz then it's not. So many things what one must avoid. All right, and here we are now. Jews moving to cities, I mean this extraordinary transformation, and become pretty much accepted in French society. In politics, Jews become Army officers. The Jewish community which existed, was aware that they must not over play their Jewishness. That is, they would take no issue, they take no position on an issue which did not directly concern them. That is, they tried to live up to the terms of the emancipation, in which they were ultimately unsuccessful. So, anti-Semitism in late 19th century France. It existed on different level, on a high intellectual level, if you can call that. Important figures associated Jews with maternity, associated Jews as people who undermined the social order, who were enemies of the major French institutions, the church, the army. And in general, these intellectuals objected to modernity, objected to what the French Revolution brought about. Anti-Semitism however, also existed on a different level. Namely, whenever there was an economic downturn or an economic scandal, the Jews were blamed. The greatest financial scandal, some of you studied European history will remember the Panama Canal scandal. Namely, the people, little people, almost 1 million, three-quarter of a million, invested in the building of the canal, and it went broke. Now two Jewish figures succeeded persuading politicians not to reveal it too soon, and consequently, they were able to make money. This was a whole wave of anti-Semitism following this economic crisis, economic downturn. And then, anti-Semitism of the petty bourgeois. Oh, just these dang Jews. A contributing factor to the rise of anti-Semitism in late 19th century France was immigration from Russia. That is, Jews arrived who were Hasidic. Jews arrived who looked very different from the acculturated French Jewry. In the case of Hungary, where this assimilation went furthest, meaning that the rabbi would give his sermon in the vernacular where men and women were sitting together, and so on and so forth. That's what acculturation meant. Not all French Jews were happy to see their payots, the coreligionists arriving in Paris and well.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-holocaust/lecture/1GpGD/1-2-2-jewish-success-and-european-antisemitism","1.2.2 Jewish success and European antisemitism","All right, what was this emancipation? The emancipation, which the French are ideologically minded people and consequently, they articulated issues better than anybody else. At the gathering of Jewish notables, this is the age of Napoleon, the idea was for the Jews as individual everything. For Jews as a unit, as a community, nothing. That is, emancipation was based on the idea that once you do away with particular restrictions imposed on Jews, Jews are going to become like everybody else. Now the consequence of that is that not every Jewish leader was enthusiastic about emancipation. Because what they saw in it is a weakening of the community. And that was an inevitable part. This is an important point to realize that everywhere where the Jews were emancipated, the idea was that, consequently, the Jews would become like everybody else and the Jews would cease to be [FOREIGN]. The Jews would occupy the same kind of jobs that all decent Frenchmen had. They would become agriculturalist workers and miners and what have you. This did not happen, because the next step is acculturation. What acculturation means is that you divest yourself from those habits, clothes, behavior pattern, which distinguished yourself as a Jew. And in this respect, Western European Jewry, French Jewry in particular, was extremely successful. That is, a Jew came to look like everybody else, dress like everybody else. Now, from the point of view of the anti-Semite, this made things worse because now, you could not easily locate them. But the third stage would be assimilation. And here, it seems to me self-evident this did not happen. The Jews did not come to be assimilated. And this was a great disappointment to those who emancipated the Jews with the idea that they would simply dissolve in French society. It seems to me that, with the possible exception, modern day United States, 21st Century United States, assimilation of Jews never happened. Now, why is that? Is our question, which I am not capable of discussing, but I think it is a fact and so it became an issue. Who is a Jew? I mean what makes a Jew a Jew? I think some Jewish thinkers came up with 11 different definitions of who is a Jew. I must not go on contemplating this difficult issue of what makes a Jew a Jew. The fact remains that they remained, they thought of themselves, willy nilly, as separate. Well, great success. Why? After all, before the 19th century, Jews, presumably genetically the same as the intellect was no less, but nonetheless, they did not make major contributions to European cultural life. They had their own cultural life. It's only with emancipation that Jews came to contribute to French, German, Russian, and so on, intellectual lives. And their contribution was very great. So the question is, how come? Why is that? Because the facts are self evident, that the Jews came to be way over represented in the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, in artistic, intellectual, scientific lights, and also in economic power. Well, what was the difference? What did they bring with themselves from their pre-emancipation past, which enabled them to be so successful as they were? Well, first of all, when you think of pre-emancipation life, what we think about is there were periodic pogroms in every European country, Jews at one time or another were expelled and then allowed to return. There were special taxes imposed on them. But on the other hand we mustn't overdo this. The Jews were not serfs. There were persecution of Jews, but not only Jews. There were religious minorities, and I'm thinking of the Cathars at this point, who were completely exterminated. There is no Cathar culture about which we can talk about, because they were gone. But the Jews survived. What did they bring with themselves into this new world? The new world of industrialization. The new world in which you were a member of the nation as everybody else. My first point, the result of such contemplation was literacy. That is, a Jewish male had to be able to read the Bible, the Torah, in order to perform religious duty. And Jewish male literacy, and to a considerable extent female literacy, was way different than any other segment of the population. It's not merely literacy, it's an appreciation of learning. You might find it striking that the place of worship is referred to as shule. I mean, you know what is a shule? There is a thirteen year old boy who shows that now he is mature. How does he show this? By taking a passage from the Torah and interpret it. When you think about it, it's quite extraordinary. Surely there is no other group, anywhere, where the maturity is demonstrated by your ability to to analyze a passage. Now, all this suddenly became extremely valuable. In as much as that society needed lawyers. And what could be a better preparation for being a lawyer than you contemplate a passage? Now you may say that the knowledge which they brought with themselves, namely religious knowledge, was not strictly speaking relevant to the new world. This is perfectly true, but that doesn't matter. What really matters is engagement with the text, engagement with knowledge and it doesn't matter what is the content of that knowledge. I was struck by how the British upper classes prepared their administrators at distant parts of the empire, by teaching them Greek, and Latin, and Latin and Roman history, which is not strictly speaking relevant. So when you think about it, all that you learn in school is not relevant to your future life. The idea of reading is a good thing. So the Jews were capable of undertaking tasks which this new society needed. That's point one. Point two, being excluded from agriculture. This is wonderful. Jews were not peasants. Why is it so good? Because it enables you to move. And what was happening was an enormous demographic change. The Jews were moving into cities. I think the first half of the century, I'm not sure about the numbers, I've forgotten. One-third of the Jews lived in Paris, and by the end of the century, two-thirds of the Jews lived in Paris. Well, the action was in the cities, that is where industrialization meant, that is where industrialization was taking place. Third, financial administration. That is, the Jews had been usurers. Some. Namely, in all the major Abrahamic religion, there is forbidding lending money on interest. By the way this also applied to Jews. Jews were not supposed to give loan to other Jews with use of interest. However, they could lend money to non-Jews. Now, some Jews played very significant roles in the creation of financial administration of the modern world. The great bankers, the Jews who worked together with ruling circles, with the kings who entrusted financial administers, they gave loans to kings making possible for them to do what they needed to be done. But also in a lower level, namely landlords, used Jews to collect grants. Now, again, in the new world, being included in this financial world, in the creation of banks, which came to be so important at the age of industrialization, the Jews had a great advantage. Now the fourth is that they had been persecuted. Now what kind of advantage is that? Well, what I have in mind is that the Jews came to believe that they can count only on their fellow Jews, sticking together. Now sometimes this needs to stay perceived about. Favorite example is that Maydove actually got his money from his fellow Jews. Sometimes he wound up making a mistake, but one Jew trusted another Jew and this cut across borders. Again it's something terribly important. You are a Hungarian Jew and you can turn to your fellow Jews, in Germany or wherever, and establish an enterprise, which was not open to others.",""

In fact, however, I will be really talking about France. France stands for Western Europe. That is the issues which arise, the points which I want to make. It seems to me I can best demonstrate with the Jewish history of France in the course of the 19th Century. My outline will be. But first, I will be talking about emancipation. I will want to make a distinction between emancipation, acculturation and assimilation. This is, it seems to me, very important. Then I want to talk about the terms of the emancipation. And the most significant topic which I want to talk about is the great success, economic, social, political success. Of the French during, and by extension Western Europe during the course of the 19th century. I want to emphasize this point again and again, because it seems to me that without being able to conceive the Jews as a powerful enemy we have a great deal of trouble understanding what the Nazi's were doing and how the Nazi's saw the world. So, it seems to me and overwhelmingly important question. How come the Jews did so well in the course of the 19th century? There's a great turning point with the French Revolution. Then, I want to talk about changes in the course of the century. And, finally, about French anti-Semitism, especially at the end 19th century. Namely, the manifestation of that phenomenon, the Dreyfus case, which probably most of you know what I have in mind. So let me start at the beginning. French Revolution as a turning point, well obviously, in real life, it doesn't really quite work like that. But the French Revolution represented, had preparations for it. It's not that from one day to the next we lived in a different world. Nonetheless, the French Revolution is a good thing to analyze, in as much as here the issues, the thoughts, which arose were most clearly explained and articulated. And France was not the first country which emancipated the Jews. America, the United States, perhaps, cannot be used as an example, inasmuch as there had not been laws, which applied only to Jews in the United States. Consequently there was no need for emancipation. Because emancipation, the word, what is means, is to do away with laws that apply only one section of the population. In this instance, about Jews. That is what emancipation is. And other countries, for example, Holland had showed great degree of tolerance, even on the course of the 18th century. However, in France, the issues were well articulated. Now, about this emancipation. Well the emancipation did not come about because the Jews demanded it. This is just not the way it works. The emancipation also did not come about because the French ruling classes, to use this semi Marxists term, and one point realized that what we are doing is wrong and there for we should do it differently. They did not do it because they had a great deal of sympathy for the Jews. In fact, many of the leading figures, most prominently, Voltaire, the great intellectual, of the late 18th century, who had so much to do with preparing the intellectual soil to the revolution. Explicitly did not like Jews, if you will, he was an anti-Semite. Though, and this will be a very important point which I want to stress again and again, anti-Semitism is a very broad concept. It really covers all sort of sins, all sort of ills. Not all anti-Semites have the same thoughts, and it's very important for us to understand what they are talking about. And my argument is that the 19th century anti-Semitism is a different phenomenon than what was happening before. So, what is the emancipation? Pre-emancipation Jewry is difficult to talk about in as much as it was very heterogeneous. But nonetheless, Jews belonged to a defined segment of society and that's the point, because feudal Europe was in an estate-organized societies. What I have in mind is that people have their definite places, clearly defined, or not so clearly defined, rights and obligations. What the French Revolution meant Is doing away with a state and come up with the idea that individuals have the same rights. And Jews just came into this category. Jewish emancipation was the same as emancipating entire French society, and so it was not done for the Jews. However, it made enormous changes. In Jewish life, and also economics, and society of entire Europe in the course of the 19th century. Now, this is something very important. For example, a German political thinker, I think of him highly, Max Nordau. Defined fascism as a repudiation, a rejection, of the emancipatory trends introduced by the French Revolution. That is, the very definition of fascism is anti-French Revolution, that is, what French Revolution meant. Because the point is that while on the one hand, the opening of opportunities created enormously richer societies, and in the material sense, people whose lives became better and easier, unquestionably. Nonetheless, the feudal society provided people with a sense of belonging. And consequently, the emancipation, spiritually or otherwise, meant a great deal of suffering for many. Now this is very important for us, in as much as Jews came to be associated with modern society, with modernization. They did not create, they did not bring about the French Revolution, as I will be saying. They did not dominate industry. In the course of the 19th century French society came to be divided. Pro French Revolution and anti French Revolution. And those who were against what the French Revolution had accomplished almost inevitably associated themselves with anti-Semitic movement.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-holocaust/lecture/IvNDN/1-1-4-poetry-and-perspectives","1.1.4 Poetry and perspectives","So, if we could look at the first of the poems called Some Holocaust Poetry. Do you see it? >> Page seven. >> And I want to mention to you that we are teaching the class in English. And yet in some ways a lot of what we are going to be talking about, most of what we're talking about, happened in other languages. And I know that for many of you, English is not your native langauge. Which give you a step up on other people who are native speakers. Who think prepositions are interchangeable parts. They're not. One of the things I ask you to think about is what languages were people talking. And when you read Dry Tears, you will discover that the family was saved because Nechama, the daughter, would speak perfect Polish. Unaccented. How many of you have abilities like that? When my father and mother and older sister were leaving Vienna, shortly after Anschluss. My father showed his passport at the railroad station to the Nazi guard, but my mother's passport had expired and my sister was on the passport. So he showed his passport and he flashed my mother's passport. She was holding my sister. And the Aryan Nazi guard, waved them through. But before that he stopped than, and stopped my sister and my mother. And looked at my sister and said, what a beautiful Aryan child because she was blonde and blue-eyed. So, he saw what ideology, what propaganda had prepared him for. Waved them through. So too, Nahama, a beautiful Aryan child. Which raises all sorts of questions, including that question about, what does a Jew look like? And you know people used to think we had horns and hooves and tails, and that's how we controlled the world. But I've already given you a tip on how you, too, can get some of the smarts by studying together. We'll see about the others. So to look at this poem, written by someone who was a young boy. Wandered between the lines of the armies. Having grown up in the city of Czernowitz, where he spoke German as his native language as many Jews did. Eventually, after liberation, he was brought to the land of Israel on a youth program. And he became a student. He got there when he was about 10. And he said to me, that at about 16, in the public schools which are in hebrew, he suddenly started to write hebrew poetry. And later on he became a very distinguished scholar of The convivencia, the Spanish world where Muslims, Jews and Christians lived and fought and worked together in the Middle Ages, well, a little bit later. But he also was a very great poet. His name is Don Poggies, and I wanna look at these poems and like all Israelis he studied the Bible, the Hebrew Bible, and that was part of his poetry. [FOREIGN] [FOREIGN] Written in pencil in the sealed railway car. Here in this carload, I am Eve, with Abel, my son. If you see my other son, Cain, son of man, tell him that I. It's an amazing poem. It's very brief. No, there's not a missing period at the end. Because it goes on. The question at the end continues, right? You saw that. You didn't need me to tell you about it. But part of literary study is to express what's implicit. And you could see right away, that this is Eve and she has 2 sons. And she's there in the car load with Abel. And then she's addressing us. If you see my other son, Cain, and she doesn't say Cain, the son of Adam. She says, son of man, tell him that I. This is a poem that raises all kinds of questions about evil, murder. Who murders whom, but why? How? That dreadful moment for a mother. Right, every once in a while, in one of those stupid TV programs. The mother of the murderer gets interviewed, right. Here is Eve, the longest line in the poem is its title. If you go to the Washington holocaust museum you will see a railway car, one of those that was sealed. And you will see that there is scratching on it. It's amazing what people do in their extreme circumstances, and so here is a poem that echoes. That derives from historical material, but puts it into the Hebrew Bible. It also puts it then into the world of myth. Because the Hebrew bible is one of those books that are about people who are so much our ancestors that they're larger than we are. And it also puts it into the present because If you see Cain, son of man, tell him that I. And it raises, then, a whole series of questions, about our responses, about their responses. And it raises a question about testimony. Eve is asking us to testify to something. Yes I saw Cain yesterday, or he's still among us, or a whole series of questions that these writers all raise. And it's a series of questions, that for example, when you watch parts of Lanzmann's movie Shoah, he keeps asking nazis. He keeps trying to interview them. What did you think? It's really hard to find a nazi who's willing to sit still, and be interviewed. On the other hand, in 1960 the Israelis' kidnapped Adolf Ikman. From this German enclave in Argentina where he'd been living, brought him to Jerusalem and put him on trial. And the result was all kinds of questions about who he was, what had he done? By the way, an Uncle of mine was in Dachau, one of the first concentration camps. He too was in Vienna at the time, and the family lore is that he got out because his wife had an interview with Eichmann. Who was in charge of these things. And persuaded Ikeman to let her husband out. They ended up in the land of Israel. Of course in 1937 and 38 and earlier, the Nazis didn't want just to kill Jews, they hadn't quite gotten there. They wanted to get them to leave and leave their success behind. And later on of course, as Peter will tell us, there were a series of events that led to murder, better to kill them. Or later on, as Primo Levi will tell us, he was chemist in Auschwitz. And his supervisor saw that these students knew chemistry. They gave them a chemistry test, and three guys passed. They then spent the winter working in a chemistry lab. He describes that. Working in a chemistry lab, developing for the Nazis. They needed all the help they could get. They needed synthetic rubber. Time is a key element in all of this. And time is one of the issues in this poem, here in this carload, I am Eve. When I say it's a mythic poem, these are mythic roles and we all play them whether we want to or not, that part of what myth is. There are also historical moments. And this is also a biblical moment. Though we have layers, if you will, of meaning. And you have to decide how to honor the different layers, and to honor the different narratives. To honor the historical narrative and the literary representation. And we're gonna argue about how to balance that, and how to balance the film. And I think of these issues as something that you, the writers and the filmmakers and the poets are going to write about in the future. >> Well if I may return to a earlier topic, what we are doing here is that Through literature, you can get a sense of the individual experience. Leading history is not very good at that. So what I will be talking about, will be institutions. I will be talking about the propaganda ministry. What I will be talking about Economic statistics. And reading literature, on the other hand. You can have a sense of the individual. So the idea of this course is to bring this together, and I think this makes our course worthwhile. >> And it raises the question about women's roles and men's roles. And it also will lead you to ask about other minorities that went through these extreme circumstances. The gypsies, homosexuals, a whole series of things. Because you have to learn about the Aryan pyramid. One of the worst things that happened at the end of the war was that Americans, soldiers, African-Americans. We're in charge of several sites, several cities. You see, African-Americans were just a little above of the Jews. There was all this hierarchy about who was important. Of course, as you turn around and look at each other. The blonde, blue-eyed ones, they were at the top of the heap. In Nazi ideology, in Nazi propaganda, a whole series of things. And if you think that doesn't still exist, >> Yes, the Jews were at the bottom, but no, the Jews represented danger, Gypsies did not represent danger. So when Nazi's talk about racial hierarchy. And the Jews are on the bottom of that hierarchy. They meant and then they did not mean it. Unlike all others, you had to be afraid of the Jews. And then, actually, toward the end, it reached the proportions which seem to me bordering on madness. >> A friend of mine who's even older than we are was in the American army in Germany >> And he was part of the occupying army. And he was, you know, like you, 18 years old, 19 years old, a soldier in very good health, buffed, all of those things that I know you all are. He had a German girlfriend, and he told me >> One day he told the German girlfriend that he was Jewish. She said, you can't be Jewish! He said what do you mean? So she pulled out one of the magazines with the pictures, the caricatures of who Jews are. Of course they didn't look at all like him. They didn't even look like Peter or Murray. They looked more like [LAUGH] batman's penguin, but that's another story. Okay.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-holocaust/lecture/4vOA7/1-1-3-why-do-we-study-the-holocaust","1.1.3 Why do we study the Holocaust?","Why study the Holocaust? One, it seems to me, glib answer is to learn from it and avoid such things ever again. I'm afraid this is not altogether convincing. I do not believe that the Holocaust presents us with simple lessons, that if we do this, then such and such is going to happen. All historical events are distinct, individual. So why do it? My answer to this is because we learn something about humanity. I cannot think of another subject which would raise fundamental questions about who we are as human beings as the events which occurred between 1939 and 1945. What I have in mind is that what would you have done? What would I have done? To this, of course, there is no answer because we never know. We will never know which one of us would have been good concentration camp guards. As our moral good fortune, nobody in this room was ever tried, I'm sure. I myself have not been tried. It's a difficult subject, the Holocaust, because there is so much emotion connected to it, one has to be so careful, one has to walk on eggshells not to hurt feelings because it raises such fundamental issues. What are we left with, my answer would be, is familiar wisdom. Wisdom, which is not the same as lessons, wisdom seems to me simply means that we learn more about the human condition, about the world in which we live. Now, does it assure that we are going to make wiser decisions? Can we take it for granted that therefore, in the future, people will not do such things as the Nazis? I'm afraid I'm not optimistic but it might be. It might be that if people are wiser, because learn more about humanity, they might act somewhat differently, and that's good enough. There's another reason, and I bring this up with some embarrassment, another reason for learning about the Holocaust. I bring it up with some embarrassment because it's not something that the historian can, or should, talk about. Namely, we owe it to the victims to know what happened to them. Why? I don't know, I cannot answer but the least we can do for them is not to turn our eyes away because it's too unpleasant. >> When Peter talks about we owing to the victims, part of every civilized culture is some way of dealing with the last generation. We bury them, we erect gravestones, we erect memorials and this raises the question historians don't want to talk about, which is memory. What we remember them and historians and memory and memorialization are not quite together. There's wonderful book by Yosef Yerushalmi, he called Zakhor, which quotes the Ten Commandments, or the Zakhor and other parts of the Hebrew text. >> What is the relationship of memory and history? That's an issue for you and it's maybe that literature is closer to this question of memorialization. By the way, look around yourselves and all the memory. >> Memory, history, memory, history. >> Look at all the memorials that are in Santa Cruz. Go across the street from the main post office, and you'll see a memorial for the Santa Cruzans who fought and died in World War I, and World War II. Where else are there memorials? One of the things that has happened is that there are many Holocaust memorials and one of the questions is are these to ask, in Germany, for example, for forgiveness for what was done? Is that what memorials are for? Is this also to ask what the Jews were like before? When I was first in Israel visiting my cousins who had fled from Germany, a West German TV crew was there. Remember, there were two Germanys at the time, in 1969. They were filming my cousins who had escaped and they were going to have a TV program in West Germany called Where Have All Our Jews Gone? I said, the Germans are doing this? These were the Jews who escaped but the others? How does one memorialize people and what does that mean in terms of a culture and a civilization? One of the things that Elie Wiesel is doing is the title of a talk I'm going to give later, somewhere else, he's accounting for Auschwitz and the end of liberal European culture. Many other of the writers we are reading will be telling you that that European culture ended with the crematorium. Some will say that Western European culture ended that had begun with Socrates and with the Hebrew Bible, and that we are in a different world since then. I know none of you were born in 1945 but Peter is 178 years old, and I'm 76. >> [LAUGH] >> We remember, something different happened after Word War II. >> It is not true that old age brings wisdom. >> [LAUGH] >> But you are the heirs of the old and the new and you will have to decide which and how and what, and there are movies like The Book Thief. There are all kinds of things that are talking about what happens to a culture when there is a huge break in the culture. There's all kinds of science fiction about that, which you read and who knows how many internet programs. We're going to be talking about history, and about literature, and about film. We're going to be reading history, reading literature, reading film, and we're going to be talking about these issues. As far as I can tell, there are as many seats in the room as there are students, so that I wanna say that if you're here now and you haven't yet signed up, you're in the class. You should try to go on and register in the class because apparently, people have left who had registered, or they're still asleep or whatever.

This is also a course that fulfills several different kinds of requirements, including requirements for the Jewish Studies major and we'll be glad to talk them and of course, other kinds of requirements. This is also a course that we hope will raise major questions that will continue through your other courses. How many of you are first year students? How many are second year? Third year? Fourth year? >> How many of you are transfer students? A word about the situation in the room. There are some cameras here. There's also a camera in the back. The camera in the back is videotaping the class for class purposes. The cameras in the front are there because this will be a MOOC.

That was, of course, a joke but how can you tell? There will be cameras here, and various other people doing this and you will see different kinds of activities. I want now to look at a poem in the back of the syllabus with you. Before I do that, I want to ask if you have any questions. Question?

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-holocaust/lecture/ABVrC/1-1-2-who-were-the-jews","1.1.2 Who were the Jews?","I'm going to join Peter in talking about who the Jews were and one of the ways in which we know who they were is in the writings that they did afterwards. And we'll be reading several books which describe the life before the Nazi murders of the Jews. In fact, the first book we're going to read is Dry Tears. It's in the bookstore. Here's the cover. It's a fascinating, important book about one family's journey, including that success that Peter mentions before through the period of time when the Nazis invade and destroy their worlds, their communities, and what happens after? And if he's interested in how the murders were done, I guess I'm interested in what that meant for those who became the victims. But who weren't only victims, who had to under extreme circumstances, very extreme, think of how they could negotiate, figure out, escape, hide. We're going to have many different possible responses, And you will have a chance to read these works. And some of them were written by people who were not successful, as in The Diary of Anne Frank. How many of you have read The Diary of Anne Frank? We're going to read a different diary, by Rywka Lipszyc, which is also in the bookstore, relatively newly published, newly discovered which has a local interest. It was found by a Soviet army captain, taken home back to Russia, and then the granddaughter of that captain came, left Russia and now lives in San Francisco and said I have this family document. And brought it to the Jewish community and it was edited and translated and published. And that's another way in which the story of the Holocaust is not yet over. It still goes on. In a whole series of ways. And it goes on asking what does it mean that the Nazis tried to exterminate an entire people and what does that mean for the people who refused to be exterminated? And one of the things Peter and I talked about is what was resistance in the camps, out of the camps. In the effort to escape, one of the question that I ask you to think about is, who helped Jews in their extreme circumstances? There was a recent best seller by Nathan Englander. The story was published in the New Yorker called, What Do We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank? An he describes a parlor game that couples play. What would you do? And in one sense, it's a question that these books put to us. And one of the questions is, who helps? Why does anyone help since they were under very severe penalties? Peter's hovering around because he wanted to answer me, but I'm not gonna let him. [LAUGH] >> And Philip Roth. >> And Philip Roth, of course, in The Ghost Writer, a wonderful book. Which is on your recommended list, which is about discovering that Anne Frank lived. And came to the United States and became a college student in the Berkshires. Can you imagine that? So one of the questions about helping is directly related to the conduct of the class. Traditional Jewish learning and that was very important in one sense for Jewish success. Traditional Jewish society says that you cannot study alone. This does not mean that you should let your roommate do the reading, but it means that any text that's worth thinking about and reading is worth discussing, and Jews for century have been studying in havruta, in pairs. So, I suggest that you think about whom you can study with in this course. As you do the reading and do the work. Whom can you talk to? After all, Peter and I argue all the time. >> That is true. >> [LAUGH] >> And, this is an issue for you. And when I say we argue, we also have this problem. We could teach two courses. One about the murderers, one about the Jews. But how do we put them together? This is a scholarly question these days, about integrating historical materials and other materials, including artistic materials. And you're going to see films which will also be raising these kinds of questions. What is the relationship of the history and the literature? And how does that get expressed? And how does the literature help us understand the history? And how does the history help us understand the literature?",""

We have started about 30 years ago to teach this course in every second year, Murray and I. And this is worth noting because at the time, when we started there were actually very few such courses. And that raises the question, how come that there is so much more attention is being paid to our subject matter, than it was in the past? Immediately after the Holocaust for example. It is a phenomenon, worth considering. Namely, we must recall that during the war, immediately after the war, the Holocaust was not at the center of human interest. It became more important and it seems to be ever growing in our horizon. And why is that? I think it has a sociological and political dimensions of, now being given greater interest to the subject matter than before. But it seems to me that there is another reason, namely the general recognition that the war, that is the second World War, was different from all other wars namely the idea of exterminating a group of human beings, being put at the center of the war aim makes this war somewhat different. What about the concepts of the course? Our course, I think, is different from other Holocaust classes, Holocaust courses, in as much as we bring together literature, film, history. >> In order to bring light to the various issues which arise. I think this collaboration makes our course, at least to my mind, is particularly interesting and valuable. Now, an unforeseen and unplanned consequence of such division, namely that Murray talks about literature, and I talk about history, you may notice that there that inevitably, Murray will be talking more about the Jews, about the victims, because after all that's what the literature is concerned about. While I, by contrast, my interest is how is this done? How could this be accomplished? Namely my interest will be much more about the Nazis about the Germans who carried out this absolutely remarkable undertaking, I would like to convey how remarkable that undertaking was and how many things had to come together and how different aspects of German society had to be coordinated in order to bring this about. Well, the subject matter of the Holocaust. There have been voices that it is natural history, it is beyond history, we cannot really comprehend. This is of course not my view, it seems to me that the Holocaust, as really all historical events, must be put in a historical context, and I will record my task to accomplish precisely that. It is true that we will never really comprehend. But that is again not so unusual, we human beings share certain characteristics, certain experiences and therefore, we can talk to one another. We are also individuals, in therefore different from one another, and consequently, every understanding about any topic is only going to be partial. Now it seems to me that in the case of the Holocaust, where we really talk about extraordinary events, which is really beyond our horizon. It is more difficult to comprehend and it requires a greater degree of imagination than it would be otherwise. Now in this course again, I think it special among Holocaust classes if, of course I haven't done any study of Holocaust classes around the country, but I believe we pay more attention to an earlier period. Namely, we regarded our task to describe the jewelry before the 1930s. Namely, to contemplate what exactly which was destroyed. And this is not an easy task because of course, the jewelry was very heterogeneous and consequently any generalization would be difficult. Here again, I believe literature, pictures which we might be able to show would bring this closer to us, give us a greater appreciation of what we are talking about. So I think that really the first third of the class will be devoted to 19th century, early 20th century. And only the second third of the class will we be coming to the Nazis. We'll be talking about the development of Nazi policies. And the third, namely at the third third of the class, will be discussing about the methods of killing. How this was done, and extermination camps versus labor camps and ghettos and everything else which goes with it. It seems to me as a historian, that it is particularly important to talk about the Jews of the 19th century. Because we have to understand who the Jews were. Not so much what the Jews did, but who they were. What I have in mind is that in order to understand how the Nazis could accomplish what they accomplish, they had to be able to portray the Jews as a grave danger. And this was an essential mobilization device. When I say that they had to be able to portray it, I don't mean that they did not genuinely believe it. They actually believed it. The Nazis really believe that the Jews represent a grave danger. Without that, I don't think they could possibly have put it so much at the center of their attention, and then as the war went on, putting it as a center war aim to killing of Jews. If they did not genuinely believe that the Jews represented a grave danger to what they considered to be, a civilized European living. Now, you and I know, we all know, that this is nonsense. The Jews in fact did not represent a danger. But we should be able to see who these jews were. That is, I will be talking about the next time and the time after. The second and my third lecture. A Jewish success. Jewish success beginning. I am really anticipating what I am going to say here. On Wednesday, a Jewish success with a beginning of the creation of an industrial society. Which can be more or less precisely dated if you wish with the French Revolution. That is in fact what came into being, was a different kind of antisemitism. Because as I'm sure that you all know this is not a controversial subject. Antisemitism has been with us going back to Roman times, that the three great, Jewish rebellion against Roman rule, and Jews, unlike some other minorities were unwilling to pay respect to Roman gods, and so on and so forth. And then they all in the 13th century, 1290 to be precise, the Jews were expelled from England and then the course of the Middle Ages, they were expelled from here and from there. And there were pogroms and what have you. But my point is that this is a different kind of antisemitism which existed after the French Revolution. Namely, the Jews were despised. There were clerical reasons for hating Jews as murderer of Christ and what have you. The Jews represented really, the only minority which was the other. But they were despised. But what happened in the 19th century, they were not so much despised, but feared. But this is irrational. But nonetheless, there is something to it, and consequently what we need to understand, what we need to describe and contemplate, the source of Jewish success. How the Jews could become, in a remarkably short time, first in Western Europe, then in Eastern Europe, economically, culturally, even politically, as successful as they were. This seems to me is one of the essential elements for our understanding of the Holocaust, individual success. But, after all, the great literary piece, the conspiracy of the ancients of Zion. What it describes is that the Jews behind the scene are controlling everything. Now of course, the Jews did not control everything. Indeed, with one exception, with the one exception of country, namely Hungary. The Jews did not control the economy, they did not control the country or life anywhere. They were just disproportionately represented. But none the less. Because they were disproportionately represented, the talk of a Jewish world conspiracy made sense to some. Together with the Free Masons and Jewish conspiracy, which motivated people. Now without this Hitler could not have accomplished what he did accomplish, and consequently our task will be to describe, to understand who the Jews were. This is not to blame the victims, it is not that, well why were the Jews the victims? Well, what I would like to convey is an understanding who the Jews were. It's not so much what they did.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/importance-of-listening/lecture/bzXLa/getting-your-paid-toolkit","Getting Your Paid Toolkit","Hi and welcome to your MOOC. I wanted to take a few minutes to talk about the paid tool kits. I put on the picture of the lady who's yelling where's the beef because one of the things I find interesting is a lot of people will join on Monday and wonder where the toolkit is on Tuesday. So what I want to do is just give you the flows and the timings that you're going to have. And so I want to focus on the paid toolkits. The free toolkits are on your MOOC. And they're located either in pieces like they do in MOOC one or it's just one big download. And so we've made those really available because they're open to everybody. The paid toolkits contain extra e-books, extra chapters. It also has special things with MOOC two technologies that allow things to happen. But the flow is the same, so I want to go through that, so you understand it. When you join, what happens is we get you into the class, we start the MOOC. And then what happens is, when you join the class they are divided into whether you are in a specialization, you paid for a single MOOC, the one you're in now or your financial aid scholarship. And what happens is, that is held at Coursera. And what they do is each Wednesday they release to us a list of the paid students. Specialization and paid people, they send it to Northwestern. The problem is, if you're in there and you join on Tuesday you're probably not going to make the Wednesday batch because they won't be able to go through and process the credit card and things like that, they're also people that it gets caught up in their system because maybe it was a wrong credit card number or something needs to be adjusted. And so during that time it doesn't come out but every Wednesday, we receive a list from them of everybody in the course who has cleared their processing and is ready to go. And so what we do is we take it here at Northwestern. And we then on the Friday, will send out the information. Now what this is the email for one,three,four and five it's the email that gives you the toolkit, and what it does is we take it on Friday we send it to you. The email does not come from coursera that's really important. The address'll be social marketing MOOC and it says do not reply social marketing MOOC at Northwestern.edu. And that's what it comes to. So when you join every Friday you ought to take a look and see when that toolkit gets there. In fact we do the same process as you will see in MOOC two, but this is the bulk paid toolkit that you'll be getting. So a couple of important notes. If we don't get everyone by the first Wednesday, generally we think by week two we've got most of the people and by Friday of that week we get everybody. But there may be some that are laggards. It's not because we're making you a laggard. Everybody who comes in on Wednesday gets mail by Friday, but if they don't come in, and if there's something wrong, we can't change that. Generally, we send them out the first couple weeks of the MOOC, as I said. Usually it's front loaded. If you don't get one immediately, please don't create a thread or even worse complain on Twitter as we have to wait 'till the e-mail clears. We're not penalizing you but it kind of really gripes in when some people join on Tuesday and then they're on Wednesday they're out there either doing 50 tweets about how much they hated it. It's like hey we're going as fast as we can, so if you don't get one by the end of class let us know and we'll go through and by doing that put it on the troubleshooting discussion boards. We're here to take care of you, we want to make sure you get it too, but if things get caught up if there's a problem with the processing, we don't have any say in it, but we will react as fast as we can. One of the thing I, for a couple of weeks now, I've been asking people to send in their stuff if they don't have the toolkits. And one of the things I'm finding is about 60% of them are in your spam filters in other words, because it comes from social marketing move that do not reply, sometimes it goes right to spam ,so here's the deal. It each Friday go out and look at your spam and see if it's in there. If you see it then you can immediately recover it and a lot of people have it in there they just don't realize it. So this is a process flow for one, three, four, and five. You join a class every Wednesday we get the list the Wednesday that you're in by Friday you will get the toolkit and that's the way it works. For the paid people at MOOC 2 it's the same process. Did you notice at the top you joined a class, each Wednesday we get a list, each Friday we send it to you, okay it comes over just like the other pay toolkits from one three four and five. However on that same Wednesday we then take a paid list of the paid participants that are unique for that week and we send it to lexalytics and we send a list of paid participants sent to IBM the same that people are both on the list. And the key is what they do is by the next week they go through and do their processing. What they do is lexalytics has to batch you up they then put you, give you an activation code and some additional things to use with Semantria. IBM matches you up to a promo code that they have in their system. They've got over a million of them, and they, you have to get the unique one to you. And what it does is it allows you to extend Blue Mix from one to six months. They key is it takes some time because one of the things that they do, it's really important is part of our contract was that they have to support this for a year. The second part of the contract is, they're not to call you and so they put you on suppression list's as well as a support suppression list with the idea that if you need support you come through the [INAUDIBLE] sight. And they make sure that they never advertise to you that they never use that email for anything and they're very, very strict on that and I like that and so we try to keep it as a separate as we can. A couple of things that are really important to note, for both of the other one on the paid tool kits for one,three,four, and five and this one. We use the email address you used to register for Coursera. And I've had some people say, well I want to use my business address, or I want to use another address. It doesn't work that way. The contract we have for Lexalytics and for IBM says, the only emails we want from Coursera for paid people with the email that they use for Coursera. So if you want to use a different one, you're going to have to create another ID at Coursera and go back through to get it, because we can't change it. There's no facility to change it, we don't want to do that either. We don't want to mess with your stuff. So whatever you've been using to get to the course is what you're going to get. Now the key thing is that if you see our email come to you on Friday in MOOC two, that by next Wednesday the following Wednesday, you'll get the Lexalytics and the IBM emails. So what you want to do is, after you get the one on Friday, then start watching on Wednesday for email from lexalytics and an email from IBM. Again, those will go to spam filters. So what you do is you look for, you're going to even get a Wednesday, maybe Thursday or Friday. But almost all the time, I've seen it goes out on Wednesday. And so here's the things, if after that Wednesday and you got it on friday and then the following Wednesday you don't have it, go out to the discussion boards for troubleshooting and just tell me. Let me know your email address, we'll try to figure it out. Do not go out on Twitter and start gripping to everyone out in the world that you don't have an invite that's probably in your spam filter. Let us work it through and figure out what's going on, but the key is it will come within you know Wednesday, Thursday or Friday depending on how they're processing it through but they're working on it as fast as they can. So everybody's dedicated to getting you the really best information and to get those toolkits as fast as we possibly can. The key though is we have to work within the constraints of what Coursera has set up and the way they are processing things. So we just ask your indulgence. It's basically Wednesdays and Fridays are the key days, when you see that first Friday toolkit come for number two, that next Wednesday you're going to get the one from Lexalytics and one from IBM. So those are the flows. We just wanted to let you know, if you have difficulty or you need some help, go into the discussion boards do not go on Twitter, and we'll be happy to help you. Thank you very much.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/importance-of-listening/lecture/U3H2Z/data-extraction-from-photos-and-videos","Data Extraction from Photos and Videos","[MUSIC] While I knew about the power of text analytics, I was shocked at how much information could be extracted from a photo or a video. Welcome Seth. >> Hey Randy. >> I heard a rumor that if I have a photo that's tagged with my name five times on Facebook, they'll be able to identify me forever. Is that true? >> Absolutely. And they'll be able to identify you regardless of who's taken the picture, regardless of the lighting, regardless of whether it's in a video or not. Now, Google may not be able to identify you because they're not sharing information. But yes, you'll absolutely be identifiable. >> Now, I was under the impression we're gonna talk about what data could be extracted from a photo, but it looks like we're having lunch, are we? >> One of us is. >> Aww. >> So, we've talked about facial identification. So, imagine we're sitting here and talking, which we are, and I'm identified as Seth Redmore, Chief Marketing Officer of Lexalytics. My Twitter handle is @SethRedmore. Here's some biographical information about me from the web, and you're identified as yourself and who you are and your place in the world. But then also inside of here, I reach for my beverage and I drink, and we notice a brand. So there's a Taco Bell brand, on the bag and on the cup. We notice that this is a beverage, and so you can identify the fact that it is Taco Bell beverage. You can identify an action of drinking. You can identify that I'm about to have a taco in front of you. And that I'm enjoying my taco. >> And I'm upset that you're having a taco and that you're not sharing it with me. >> Exactly. And you can say, okay, these hot sauces, very identifiable colors. And I happen to like these two particular kinds of hot sauces. So you can identify what's being consumed, what's being done, and who is doing it and how they're feeling about it from the photo or from the video. >> So let's say I'm out at a bar, and I am having a beer with some friends of mine. But in the foreground at another table, somebody takes a selfie. Are you able to identify me in the background, and what sort of things could you identify from that photo? >> I could identify you. I could probably identify where you are, particularly if they geo-tagged the photo. Also, I can probably identify where you are if other photos had been taken in that institution that had been tagged with that institution's name, like somebody checked in. I can tell who you're with. So there's a lot of pieces of information that can be extracted just from that photo. >> And so, even though I'm not the subject of the photo, it is still analyzing me in the background. >> Yes. >> Does that happen with, say, videos as well? >> Absolutely. >> Can you give us an example of that? >> Yeah, sure, so imagine a party, and somebody's walking around and they're videotaping the party. And they're getting people's faces in there, and maybe those faces are being recognized, or maybe not, depending on whether they're tagged in something that's associated with wherever they uploaded it. You can identify something about those people, demographic information like racial characteristics, gender, age. You can identify whether they're happy or sad, angry. Of course, you can identify the sort of brands that they're are interacting with, are they happening to have a beer, are they enjoying their beer, are they pouring it out on the ground. So you can tell an awful lot from that video, even without knowing who the people are. But if you know who the people are, then you can associate it back to a profile, with like this person happens to generally always drink this kind of beverage. Why don't we send them some coupons? >> Oh, great. >> That sort of thing. >> What are some other examples of how video is being analyzed to help people gather information and insights from the video itself? >> Law enforcement is a huge application. Imagine you're at a riot. I don't anticipate I'd ever see you at a riot, but imagine you are, and you're taking video of it. You can extract where it's occurring, particularly if you were to tag it as this is happening where, or by street signs, or by storefronts that are there that are only in that particular area. Particular if other people have taken video of that area, so you know where it is. You could identify the people that are there. You could identify that maybe it's associated with a sporting event because everybody's wearing sporting jerseys. You can identify that people are doing bad things like, say, trying to break into something or stealing something or hurting another person. >> That's done by machines, not by people. It's all machine learning. >> So, exactly, it's done, the important thing to note here is the first pass will be done by machines. The humans will teach the machines, and machines will do it. And it provides this filter for humans to then look at. And say, oh okay, something really bad did happen here, as opposed to having to watch the 24 hours of video that are uploaded every minute. >> I also heard that with using machines, they can watch, say, a soccer game or a football game and actually write the story about it. Is that true? >> Yeah, so imagine all these technologies working together. So at the top, you have the video technology recognizing the players. The players are wearing uniforms that have numbers on them. You know the roster. So that makes it easy to track them. You know they're two different teams, so they've got two different color uniforms on. You can look for various events inside of the game, like a yellow card, or somebody got hurt and ended up on the ground, or somebody scored a goal. These are all events that are relatively, they're anomalies, and so, they're easy for the machine to pick out. And so that allows somebody who wants to write a story about a two hour event to collapse it down to three minutes of, okay, here's the interesting stuff. And when you combine that with, say, speech to text, you can understand what the announcers are saying and collapse that down as well, and have all that analysis presented to you so that you can then put your own verbiage and spin on it. >> That's really amazing. One of the things I really appreciate is Lexalytics also has a product called Semantria that essentially takes the big information you've talked about as extracting and actually turns it into big insights for a business. And one of the things I love is that you're going to provide that to our participants. Can you tell us a little bit about Semantria? >> Lexalytics focuses entirely on text. We feel that there needs to, there's enough complexity there for us to be solving those problems for a long time. So what we've done is we've produced a couple data sets based on the hotel industry. And so, hotel A, hotel B. You run hotel A. And so you wanna know what's going well and what's not going well inside of your hotel and if there's certain people on staff that happen to be doing a better job or worse job. But you wanna move in on Hotel B's territory and start taking business away from Hotel B so you can look to see what are they doing well and what are people complaining about there, so that you can offer the services and advertise the things that will actually bring business from them to you. >> That's a fantastic tool for our participants to learn how to do social monitoring. I want to thank Seth for these great insights into what can be done with the photos and videos, as well as access to Semantria. [MUSIC] [SOUND]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/importance-of-listening/lecture/3LSwd/data-extraction-from-social-documents","Data Extraction from Social Documents","[MUSIC] In our last video, we saw how fast it is to extract big data from anywhere in the world and get it ready for analysis. In this video, we're going to take the next step of looking at how that big data is transformed into big information to help you with your marketing programs. Our guest is Mr. Seth Redmore of Lexalytics. I found Seth by asking my professional network who would be the best to teach me about machine learning and text analytics. When a number of them said Seth Redmore, I contacted him. This is what we want you to accomplish with your professional persona and in building your professional network. Welcome Seth. >> Thanks Randy. >> Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and Lexalytics? >> Sure. Right now, I am Chief Marketing Officer at Lexalytics. I've been in tech for about 20 years. I spent about 13 years in networking technology, culminating with founding and selling a company to Cisco. Then while I was at Cisco, I started to get really interested in how can we measure the effectiveness of marketing beyond things like revenue and stuff like that. How can we look at how we're changing the conversation and so, I decided to start looking into text binding and text analytics. And so, I've been with Lexalytics for six years. Lexalytics has been around since 2003. We shipped our first product in 2004, which was the worlds first commercial sentiment analysis engine. Now we are the strongest player in social listing, social marketing applications, and customer experience management. Our customers process about 3 billion to 4 billion documents a day through our system. >> Wow, that's amazing. In this video, we're gonna be talking about text analytics. If I posted something, say, on what sort of information can you extract out of there, from reading that? >> Sure. So the way to sum it up is you give me a piece of text and I will tell you who, what, when, where, some about why, but most of it so you can figure out why and understand what you need to do to change your business and to make more money. There's a couple technical terms. So there's something called named entity extraction. That's the who, and the where. It's company's products, places, people. You can make other things entities, but those are generally what they are proper nouns. And you make them and entity, so you can associate other things with them, like sentiment. Themes are automated topic extractions. What's the buzz? What are people talking about with this? Are they talking about the comfy chairs in there? Are they talking about the cold pool? Are they talking about the hard bed? What are the things that are really coming up inside of the conversation? Categories are the other side of the coin from topics and themes. So categories are things that you are interested in following and you know you're interested in following. So you tell the system, okay, I want the following categories. Location, service, bedroom. Those sorts of thing. Intentions is a relatively new technology. So it's what is someone going to do in the future? Are they going to buy something? Are they going to sell something? Are they quitting your service and buying somebody's elses? So intention analysis allows companies to reduce turn, find new customer leads, and then overlay ed over, sorry go ahead. >> Well what would be an example of intention? >> Yeah, so oops, I dropped my camera. Now I need to buy a new one. Very simple, very straightforward example. There's a lot more sophisticated examples than that, but once either a camera or a review site or a camera company sees that, that's a great time to reach out to them with a tweet and say hey how about 20% off on your next camera. >> That's an example of real time marketing. >> Exactly. So sentiment analysis is layered on top of this. You can get sentiment analysis at a number of different levels. And it's really important to have very fine grained sentiment analysis. So the sentiment of my company, inside of this article, the sentiment of another company may be completely different. And if you're only looking at document sentiment of the whole thing, you're gonna miss out on some of those differences between there. >> You talk about sentiment. What does the term sentiment mean? >> Sure, it's, are the opinions expressed inside of here positive, negative, or neutral? As related to the entity, or to the theme, or to the overall category? Because, for example, a category, like energy exploration may be somewhat negative in an article, but there's a company that's doing really well inside of this. So, they'll be positive in that article. So, it's important to tease out where you're being seen negatively in a positive place and vice versa, so that you can take advantage of that. >> Okay, but what about if I'm using something like sarcasm or attempting to tell a joke, or maybe there's an oil spill, and I say it's the biggest or the most colossal, which sounds positive but it isn't. How do you handle that? >> Sarcasm and humor we handle perfectly. That's a different issue than the biggest and largest. So the contextual understanding is completely important for understanding whether a word is a positive thing or not. From the perspective of oil spills everywhere, being a biggest oil spill, that's great. Oil spills love that. But from the perspective of the Gulf States that were affected by, say, a very large oil spill, that's a negative thing. So, it's all about context. You need semantics, what could the words mean? You need syntax, what's the order of the words, and the structure of them? And then you need context to determine whether something is positive or negative. And even to try and figure out whether it's humor or sarcasm, you need to know, contextually speaking, what did this person talk about before that suddenly they're talking about this very differently. So if they're really positive on something they used to be really negative on, like even just the tweet before maybe, maybe, maybe just a hint of sarcasm. [MUSIC]",""

Our first guest is Mr. Steve Dodd of Socialgist, a data aggregator that brings all of this together. Welcome, Steve. >> Thank you, Randy. >> Can you tell me a little bit about yourself, and Socialgist? >> I've been in the marketing technology business for probably about 40 years. Evolving from the early days of direct mail up until now the automated marketing for social media. I joined Socialgist six years ago, previously was a customer. And they have evolved the database of online social media content from all over the planet since the late 90s to service brands and analytic companies to figure out what people are thinking about. >> One of the things I find most fascinating is Socialgist, which was then called Board Reader, was really at the start of social. In fact, they were in social before it became social. And they have an interesting story as to how they were founded. Can you tell us a little bit about that? >> Our founders started the company in classic tech start up in a dormitory at University of Michigan. They are avid car collectors, looking for used parts across the bulletin boards all over the US. And happened to uncover an emerging problem with Ford and tires that they ultimately reported back to Ford with the trend separation problem in the late 90s. >> And so what happened after that? >> Ford basically became their first client. >> Yeah, and so what happened was they had stumbled into something that we're gonna learn about in this MOOC, and that is people talk on social before they do anything else. And so what they really picked up was a crisis in the making. They told Ford about it, which became a major lawsuit. But it was the idea that people in social and then they take action, something that we're gonna see a lot about as we go through this MOOC. Can you tell us a little bit more about the big data that Socialgist gathers and how that all works, and who it's given to? >> Well, we're collecting content from all over the planet. Aggregating it, retaining it, normalizing it, making sense of all of these from roughly 30 plus million websites. And providing access to analytic services companies that interpret it to understand what it means. >> So you went out to all of these sites. You're extracting data to your APIs. Bringing it in and structuring it so that other companies can use that data to go from big data to big information? >> Yes, for crisis management to identify communities of interest where they can in turn advertise back into the platforms. Product development so they can understand what issues are out there, positioning of products, that kind of thing. >> So because you're at the bottom where you're actually gathering the data that drives this entire engine, you probably are in a number of different countries. How many countries are you in and what are the hot countries right now that are really getting going in the whole area of social. >> We cover data from 196 countries, 45 different languages. We're seeing the evolution of the Internet world wide now where consumers are having online access that they've never had before. So, we're seeing massive growth in China, Russia, South America, anywhere in Southeast Asia, and Africa because of the access. >> Is there a lot of social in Antarctica, in the Arctic? >> No, we haven't figured out how to use seals yet. >> There we go. >> [LAUGH] >> So, someone posts something on somewhere in the country. >> Right. >> How long does it take for you to pick it up, structure it and then give it to other companies where they can develop the big information out of that? >> Totally depends on the site. Some of these sites are very, very small. Getting data from them is longer than some of the major properties. But when we're out accessing data, it could be anywhere from 24 to 48 hours to almost instantaneous. Like some of the data we're getting from our big feed partners on the other side of the planet. >> That's cool. One of the things that you do in my class that I really enjoy, is that you always leave with some tips that from your experience in what is happening in social, that our students could learn from. I'd like to ask you to share a couple of those with the participants in this MOOC. >> One thing that is an absolute fact, if access to an internet site is free, you are their product, they're taking your information, providing access and information to advertisers to earn money on it. The other one we like to really promote is, what happens on the Internet stays on the Internet. Forever, there's no way to get rid of it, no way change it, no way to delete it. Somebody always trying to figure out who you are and what you're doing and what you're gonna do next. So be very careful what you post online. What you think is innocent today, may not be as innocent tomorrow and there are endless examples of this. The last one is especially for marketers. The more people understand about the foundations of the Internet, and how people engage in the Internet, the more power they can add to their marketing skills. And the application of social media in general in a business world. >> Really, if you understand how big data becomes big information and then gives you big insights, you could learn from the social conversations the things that people are passionate about. And, as a result, businesses and entrepreneurs can really select the best possible strategy. Based on the fact that they understand what the people are looking for in software. >> Absolutely.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/importance-of-listening/lecture/40Iay/using-social-data","Using Social Data","[MUSIC] Hello, and welcome to the second MOOC in our Social Marketing Specialization. Social data is important to understand the needs and wants of your high value markets. It enables you to identify the best content. To engage influencers and helps you identify where to engage them in the social pyramid. Our journey starts with social big data. It shows you how social data is collected from the global social pyramid. You'll see how it is translated, aggregated, cleaned, and prepared for analysis often in a matter of seconds. Next, we will show you how big data is developed into big information which allows you to determine the nature, sentiment, topics, and people being discussed. Our initial focus will be on text analysis. After we examine text, we will place a spotlight on photos, audio, and videos. It is amazing what big data scientists can do with the visual and auditory media. Finally, we will examine a host of analytic systems designed to transform your big information into big insights to drive your social strategies and build your professional persona. Finally, we will end this MOOC by looking at organizations people talk about problems on social days or weeks before they take action. You can monitor and identify crisis before they become serious and we will show you a company doing just that. Often, consumers will say something on social which indicates they have a need for your products and services. Big insights can analyze every aspect of your high value markets. Before we begin our social big data journey, there are three terms you need to better understand. Everyone using a word processing program, understands the term document. In social big data, a document refers to any single entry on any type of social media. It might be a tweet, a blog article, a form thread, a video, or even an audio file. The term is important because most paid social analytic systems charge by the document. A snippet is a part of a document containing important analysis information. An example is a paragraph within a blog article. Snippets are where we talk about different topics, people, or companies. Several of the more sophisticated social analytic system breakdown documents into snippets to give you a more thorough analysis of the document. An API is an automatic programming interface. APIs are used to extract social data in real time from a social site. You need an API for every social site you want to evaluate. Some companies write their own. And link them into an analytics system like the ones we will see and use. Most however, use a system like Socialgist to get social data from around the world. Socialgist is integrated into the social analysis system we will use as we view big insights. Finally, keep in mind, our journey from big data to big insights, we use every type of media in the social pyramid. These systems will allow you to perform very detailed analysis of any topic, community, or competitor you need to develop your social strategies. As you will see, these systems can give you insights and capabilities you can use today to immediately impact your high value market. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nonprofit-gov-2/lecture/yML4j/course-2-overview-video","Course 2 Overview Video","[MUSIC] Hi professor Yvonne Harrison here from the Dept. Public Admin. & Policy at the University at Albany. Welcoming you to the second course in a series of courses on developing leadership and improving governance in non profit organizations. In this video, I will review course two. Introduction to non-profit organizational governance, and boards of directors. I'll begin with the learning outcomes, and leadership competencies emphasized in the course, and the learning activities that will take place each week. I'll conclude with the assessment of learning which will take place in the fourth or fifth week. By the end of this course, you will have developed knowledge about the legal role and authority of board members and boards of directors. You will have worked with a board of directors or with information gathered from a board of directors any analyzed it's effectiveness. And finally, you will have applied the knowledge gained through this course to help a board improve its effectiveness. This course is designed to introduce you to the leadership competencies required by academic programs that are accredited by NASPAA. And NASPAA is the network of schools of public affairs in North America. This course emphasizes two NASPAA leadership competencies. To lead and manage within the governance process. To analyze and think critically about leadership and governance effectiveness challenges. It should be noted that this course was developed with North American requirements in mind. And we do appreciate that the non profit sector, non profit organizations, leadership and governance may not be the same in other parts of the world. It is our intention, however, that the course content will be of value to others and that cultural differences will provide a rich forum for discussion. Now I'll turn to the topics and questions addressed in this course. The topic of week one is the boards role in strategic planning. Some of the questions we will explore this week are what is planning and why is it important for nonprofit organizations to do it? What is strategic? What is a strategic issue, and what is strategic planning? And what is the board's role in strategic planning? In week two, the topic is the board's role in performance assessment. The key questions you will explore this week are, what is the board's role in performance assessment? Why is performance assessment important? Why do boards have difficulty meeting performance assessment responsibilities? What frameworks exist to help boards measure And manage performance. And how can the effectiveness of nonprofit boards, CEO's and organizations be improved through the performance assessment function? The topic of week three is the board's role in fundraising and resource development. The key questions you will explore this week are, what is fundraising and resource development and why is it important? What should be the board's role in resource development? Why do many boards have problems clarifying and implementing their role? And what basic information should be used in a resource development plan? Within the platform you'll find weekly lectures, videos, readings and links to external resources that point you to important content. Once you review the content, you're ready to engage in the learning activities. Take a practice quiz. Based on the required content, the quiz is a chance to test your knowledge and further develop it. Because it is a practice assessment, your scores will not be counted into the final course grade. Post a commentary. Commentaries can be based on an insight from the readings that helped you understand a situation or event that you have experienced. Anything from the reading that you found confusing or unclear could also be posted. Remember the basic goal is to help you connect the dots by linking your ideas and questions on the topic, drawing on what you've learned from the readings and applying it to your own experience. Analyze a nonprofit case, a case is based on a real world situation. Like the real world, there is usually no single correct answer to the issues they raise. The cases assigned in this course are intended to provide you with a chance to reflect and apply concepts from the course, as well as enable you to understand and resolve practical problems in governance. Work on the course project. The course project is an academic service learning experience that provides you with an opportunity to apply the course content and your learning to help a real board develop leadership and improve governance effectiveness. Whether you gather information from a real board or you use the information that we gathered, we'll upload instructions and information that you need to complete the work associated with the course project. The end of course assessment of learning will take place in the fourth and fifth week. The first assessment of learning strategy comes from Michelson's method of teaching and learning, known as Team-Based Learning. TBL is used to test mastery of course concepts, using readiness assurance test, and application exercises. In the fourth week we'll open two multiple choice Readiness Assurance Test or RATs as we will humorously refer to throughout the course for you to complete. One RAT will assess knowledge based on reading comprehension and the other will test knowledge application based on a case. In the fifth week, we will encourage you to discuss the RATs in the forums and to take them again should you wish to change any of your answers based on the information exchanged. We chose this method of assessment because it is associated with student learning, including concept comprehension, student motivation, communication, accountability, problem-solving, and superior academic performance. The second assessment of learning is the Board Effectiveness Assessment Reflection which we will humorously refer to as the BEAR. In a nutshell, the BEAR is a short written reflection on the nonprofit board and organization you are working with. You are asked to define nonprofit leadership and governance and the criteria for evaluating board effectiveness. You're bear should address the following questions. What is nonprofit governance? What are the key governance concepts? What is board effectiveness? And how do you measure and assess it? Help your board understand governance effectiveness by illustrating the key governance concepts within a conceptual framework, a chart, or figure that shows how the concepts relate to each other. Be sure to include an introduction to the reflection and a description of how it's organized. In the fifth week, you'll be asked to peer review Bear assignments. To receive a course grade, you must complete peer reviews. In this video, we've reviewed course two, introduction to non profit organizational governance and boards of directors. We've reviewed the learning outcomes, the leadership competencies. Topics and questions, and the learning activities you'll engage in each week. We've covered the end of course assessment of learning, that will take place in the fourth and fifth week. For more information, refer to the course content. [MUSIC] [SOUND]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nonprofit-gov-2/lecture/YjcD8/welcome-video-introducing-this-series-of-course","Welcome video introducing this series of course","[MUSIC] Hi, I'm Professor Yvonne Harrison from the Department of Public Administration and Policy at the University at Albany. Along with my colleague, Professor Vick Murray of the School of Public Administration at the University of Victoria and Elena Rodik, Instructional Designer at Empire State College, we want to welcome you to this series of courses on developing leadership and improving governance in non-profit organizations. By registering for one or more of the courses in this series, you are part of a university at Albany and an open SUNY innovative instructional technology grant to increase access to non-profit management and leadership education. In this video, I'll describe why we decided to develop a series of courses on leadership and governance in non-profit organizations. How the series is structured and the learning within it organized and what you can do to get the most value out of each course. I'll conclude with our role and some ground rules for engagement. Again, thank you for registering and welcome. Why did we develop this series of courses on developing leadership and improving governance in non-profit organizations? Well, we decided to develop a course on improving leadership in governance in non-profit organizations for several reasons. One, I've been teaching this course on-site for many years, and I've also taught it online. And, it meets the curricular guidelines for non-profit management and leadership education. Two, this course contains new methods of teaching and learning. Academic service learning and team based learning that have been associated with student development and success. Three, this course also connects to our research on nonprofit governance and leadership. And through this research we've been able to develop a number of open tools and resources for nonprofit boards and organizations to improve their leadership and governance effectiveness. And finally it emphasizes a number of leadership competencies that are required by schools of public affairs, that are accredited by NASPA. And NASPA is the Network of Schools of Public Affairs in North America. How is the series structured and the learning within each course organized? We've organized this series in three short courses. Each course examines a specific topic, set of questions, and concepts. The first course provides a theory and background to the non-profit sector, non-profit organizations, and the concepts of leadership and governance the second course focuses on the role and responsibility of non-profit boards of directors in the governance process. And finally the third course examines factors that have been associated with the effectiveness of boards within the governance process. Each course if further broken down into five weeks. During weeks 1 through 3, you will be encouraged to review content, take a practice quiz, reflect on a board case, and post a commentary in the discussion forums. You will also find guidance on the service learning assignment where you will have the opportunity to apply your knowledge to a real world non-profit governance and leadership situation. Learning will be assessed during the 4th and 5th weeks, during the fourth week you will be asked to submit a written assignment and take two short multiple choice tests. One task will assess course knowledge, while the other assesses application of knowledge within a practical case. In week 5, you will have the opportunity to discuss the test and to take them again, should you wish to change any of your answers. We'll count the highest test scores into your final course grade. How do you get the most value out of each course? We believe you'll get the most value, if you register for each course in the series, and you download the required text, and complete all of the learning activities. This is a especially important, if you plan to use this for continuing education or to earn course certificates. Finally let me say a few words about our role and some rules for engagement. We've taken the role as facilitators of learning. Bringing to you into one place the latest knowledge and research on a complex subject. All of the people involved are experts in their field and are donating time for a cause they believe in and that's increasing access to non-profit management and leadership education. And finally, I'd just like to go over some rules for engagement. As we launch this series of courses on Coursera's new on demand platform, don't be surprised if there are a few technical difficulties. We're depending on you to communicate those issues to us so that we can respond to them. We ask that when you do communicate those, you communicate them professionally and be respectful of the people involved. In fact, in all interactions in this online community we ask that you try to emphasize the leadership competencies that we're trying to develop in this course, and most of all have fun. I wanna thank you for registering, and we look forward to seeing you each week. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nonprofit-organizations/lecture/NYC8f/interview-with-ruth-mccambridge","Interview with Ruth McCambridge","[MUSIC] Ruth McCambridge joins us today to share some information about the Nonprofit Quarterly, and an article she wrote in it called Underestimating the Power of Nonprofit Governments. Ruth can you tell us about the mission of the Nonprofit Orderly and the audience that it is aimed at? >> Well Nonprofit Quarterly's audience is, well we've got a variety of communities that are among our audience. And really primary among them are people who are working in and around nonprofits and in civil society. But the mission of our journal is very different from most other journals in that our mission is to promote active democracy. We see nonprofits as a venue for people taking action on issues that they are concerned about that affect them. And so the nonprofits and the management, the governments of the nonprofits is then our business. Because the way nonprofits are governed have everything to do with the levels of engagement around them. So it is different from an academic journal, but we've really got one foot in academia and one foot in practice. And so what we try to do is to move questions and answers back and forth between those two realms. So that as questions appear in practice or in academia that we can test them in both areas and see if there are ways to get to answers so that we can move the learning a lot more quickly. >> Why did the Nonprofit Quarterly decided to publish a special issue on nonprofit governance? >> We decided to do a special issue because I think governance is one of the areas in which nonprofits have the most confused practice. In general, we feel like they don't quite understand the capabilities of governance. That they don't understand what it can be used for. And there is an enormous amount that has to be unlearned before people can even begin to learn what the potential of governance really is. And so what we decided to do was to put together a collection of articles which really reflected the latest in research on the issue. And use it as a platform, actually, for surfacing additional questions and so you'll find some really classic articles in there. Like article about reframing governance, which is, it's been the jumping off point for a lot of other inquiries on the issue of network governance. So what we see the collection is being is really a kind of a small reader on the basic questions that we're working on right now. >> Ruth, why did you make this special governance issue accessible to students? >> Well, Nonprofit Quarterly is mission driven. We're a nonprofit ourselves, and our major intention is not to make money off of what we produce, but it is to help people learn about the practice of running these very important democratic institutions. And for us, it's just a thrill to be able to share this with the students in this course. It's a thrill. And I would encourage people as you continue along in your practice, if you feel like in your reflection of your own practice you've learned something, that you want to question something. Feel free to submit an article to us because that's how the dialogue continues. >> Ruth, you wrote an article in the special governance issue on underestimating the power of nonprofit governance. What is this article about and why is it important? >> The article is about governance as it exists in a nonprofit's universe. Less about boards, much more about relationships with stakeholders that nonprofits have and it can work with if they are so inclined in my opinion. The reason why I wrote this article was because I had been a part of a number of events in Northern Ireland and elsewhere where we really took some very significant critical questions to a group of 90 people or more. And tried to work with them to get to a place where we understood what was the future that was being longed for collectively and what they wanted to do about it. In general I feel like that is the basic core job of governance is to do that with one's stakeholders often enough and in a way that's open enough that the longings of the stakeholders. The beneficiaries of the organization are actually reflected in the work that the organization does in a way that can be seen and experienced. When I say that we underestimate the power of nonprofit governance. The way most boards function is so insular at this point and so limited in terms of its ability to really gauge what it is stake holders want from an organization. Especially as it moves into the future that we're just wasting an enormous resource because when you do work with the larger scheme of governance it brings you all kinds of other riches. Because then you've got people's energy. You've got people's intelligence. You've got people's you know, whatever capital they may have to share with you. They're ambassadors for you. So that it's just so wasteful for a nonprofit to really think small. That all there is to governance is the board. In fact, governance exists all around an organization, and if you ignore it, it may bring you up extremely short because they may call you on your lack of responsiveness. That's happening more and more often, as we know. Because the digital environment is making it very easy for stakeholders to call any kind of institution, but particularly a nonprofit, up short if it does not reflect the value set of the stakeholders. >> Can you give some examples of how a board might engage its stakeholders and community? >> Yeah, I, recently, worked with an organization in Jackson, Tennessee. And it's a small city. It's a older organization, probably 50 years old. And a multi-service organization. And it had started off as being an anti-poverty agency. And over the years it had very, very good leadership. And then it hired a real charismatic nutcase. And the charismatic nutcase went very systematically about ruining all the relationships that the organization had, so they lost a number of funding relationships, other things happened, and they fell really out of connection with a good part of the community. When I talked to the woman who was the new executive director after that man had left. What we talked about was her really calling up everybody in the community that she could think of that might possibly be a decent board member. Not to ask them on the board but to ask them if they would participate in some committee or another, that would take up one critical question of this organization that had to do like this massive rebuilding. And in the process of doing that, they engaged, they had each board member take a committee, and they involved staff, and then they would involve community members in these committees. In doing that, what they found was that they actually identified all of these people who were interested in the organization. Most people said yes to her. They just needed to be asked. And then they were able, through the committee work, to help them understand what the critical variables were in for the organization at that point. As a result of all of that, they've engaged this kind of massive base of people around the organization that can be called on. But they've also been able to observe people in such a way in that committee work, that they've been able to choose the best of them to move on to the board. And they've already experienced this larger engagement system, so they know how important it is. And that was kind of the way in to develop this larger system. There are I think a number of ways to do this, but that's at least one that was entirely within the reach of a small community organization. So this doesn't need a super sophisticated system. It needs thought about, what kind of community do I exist in? What are the questions they might have? How do I engage them in good faith in answering our combined questions together and that kind of invitation automatically creates a link and then you build on it from there. >> Finally your article is going to be the subject of a peer learning discussion this week. Can you suggest some questions to help frame our discussion? >> I think the questions that people should consider is do you know who your stakeholder groups are? And particularly, who your primary beneficiaries are? John Carver used to talk about that your primary fidelity should be to those in whose name you do business. So who it is that you take money to serve or to represent should be your primary beneficiaries. Do you know who they are? Do you know how to balance the demands of that group against the demands of others, say funders? These are some of the most difficult questions that nonprofits and NGOs face. How do we fairly represent the needs and the interests of our beneficiaries when we spend so much time elsewhere? Do you have ways of inquiring what your beneficiaries' needs are? Are those ways, are they closed questions or open questions? That's a very important distinction. If you're surveying or doing a needs assessment, that is very different than convening people. And asking people what are your greatest longings about what we do. So those are the questions really who are our stakeholders, how should we be consulting them? Who do we need to listen to most acutely? And how do we develop our future plan from all of that? Those are the questions that you have to ask yourself. >> Thank you, Ruth, for sharing your journal, your knowledge, and these questions which we look forward to discussing this week. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nonprofit-organizations/lecture/zx5Gg/week-1-overview","Week 1 Overview","[MUSIC] Welcome to the first course in Developing Leadership and Improving Governance in Nonprofit Organizations. This week, we'll focus on the nonprofit sector, nonprofit organizations, and the role they play in society. [MUSIC] This short lecture is organized around the following framework of questions. Why do we have a nonprofit sector? What are some of the names that we call it? What types of organizations are part of the nonprofit sector and how big is it? Where does the nonprofit sector and the organizations that comprise it fit in relation to government and for for profit business? What role do nonprofit organizations play in society? And I'll conclude with questions to frame our discussion in the lecture forum this week. The question, why do we have a nonprofit sector, is one that Lester Salamon has examined. In his research, he boils it down to a number of reasons that explain the existence of the nonprofit sector. One, historically, communities formed long before governments existed. When people would come together to solve local problems. But as government and the market grew, it came to be realized that they were not able or willing to resolve all of the problems and concerns in the community. And their failure to deal with these concerns led to the formation of nonprofit and voluntary organizations. So the existence of the sector can also be explained by the failure of government and the market to meet all of the needs of the community. But nonprofits are also a mechanism to allow pooling of resources to produce collective goods, which the market doesn't do well within a subset of the population. They also help with those with interests that are not large or popular enough to be of concern to the state or to be profitable in the market. Other reasons come from the freedom to express values and interests. But people either can't express themselves, or wouldn't as individuals. And we see this expression in self-help groups, groups based on a sexual orientation, ethnicity, sports groups, hobby groups, arts and culture and so on. That the emergence of the sector from this perspective can be explained by pluralism and solidarity. The next question gets at, what do we call the nonprofit sector? Now, this lecture is called the nonprofit sector, but if you review the literature, and even in the terms used where you're from in your own country, you'll see that a variety of terms are used to describe what we're calling the nonprofit sector as a sector of the economy. The third sector the informal, resilient, the nonprofit sector, a term used in the United States. Invisible, independent, civil society used internationally. Voluntary used in some countries like Canada and the United Kingdom. The social sector. And now, more recently in Canada, the social economy. There is also a variety of terms used to describe nonprofit organizations as a type of organization. And there's a variety of terms from a charitable organization, a nonprofit, a not-for-profit, internationally you often hear a non governmental organization, a voluntary organization. An association, a cooperative, a social enterprise, or a social purpose organization. And these terms are used to describe a type of nonprofit organization. The third question gets at, what types of organizations count as part of the nonprofit sector. So the organizations that are counted as part of this sector of the economy are those that have an established organizational presence. They're incorporated as private organizations that are not controlled by government. They are also organizations that do not share profit with their owners and that they invest in the mission of the organization. They provide benefits either to the public or private members. And use labor, volunteer labor, in the governance of the organization and, or the management of its activities. In terms of the nature of nonprofit work, just looking into Public Charities in the United States. You'll see the diverse nature of the work that charities do. In the human services, arts, culture, humanities, education, health, environment, religion, public and societal benefit. Types and international or foreign affairs. Nonprofits doing charitable work. This slide looks at labor, the use of labor in a nonprofit sector or organizations and you'll see statistics here. Across country that a significant amount of labor is coming from volunteers. And philanthropy, the giving of time, is a significant characteristic of nonprofit organizations. In addition to the giving of time, this slide shows that a significant amount of revenue comes from gifts and donations. So philanthropy, the giving of money is an important revenue source. And source of income for organizations in the nonprofit sector. You'll see this varies by country. In Australia, of almost 50% of revenue is generated from gifts and donations. Whereas in other countries like Germany and Canada, a significant amount of revenue is coming from government funding. And in the United States and in Italy, you'll see fees and charges for services as a large source of revenue. The fourth question examines how big the nonprofit sector is. And a large amount of this data comes from Lester Salamon's work and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins. See, the nonprofit sector, globally, is very large and diverse in terms of the number, types, and sizes of organizations. In the United States alone, nonprofit organizations account for 5% of the national economy. So it's a large contributor to the economy. Compared to national economies, the global nonprofit sector is equal to, in size, to the eighth largest economy in the world. Here, we have a slide with statistics on the size of the nonprofit sector and in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States which has the largest sector in the world, you'll see that it varies by country. The numbers of organizations that are counted by each country as part of its not-for-profit sector include charitable and non-charitable corporations of a certain size. These statistics do not include the large number of smaller corporations, both charitable and non-charitable, and also the unregistered voluntary associations. Which you can see in the United Kingdom represents a much larger percentage of the sector. The slide further shows that the not-for-profit sector is a significant employer in terms of the number of full time equivalent workers. In the United States, for example, you'll see that there are more full time equivalent workers in the not-for-profit sector than employees in the public sector. In both the federal and state governments combined. And finally, this slide shows that the revenue generated by the not-for-profit sector in each country is significant, and in the United States, you'll see these revenues have doubled in the past 20 years, and that the size of the sector really contributes about 5 to 10% estimates to the national economy. In Canada, for example, the not-for-profit sector is equal to the entire economy of British Columbia. Look at the organizations that are counted as part of the nonprofit sector fit in relation to government and for profit business. Well, one way to look at, or think about these organizations, in the nonprofit it's a sector of the economy, is along the public, private goods continuum. And the public good side of the continuum, we have the public sector and government. And governments collect tax and they use the revenue from tax to deliver public goods and services. Consists of legislators and public administrators who are accountable for the delivery of public goods and services within the rule of law, so that people are treated fairly and equally. On the private goods side of the continuum, we have the private for profit sector in the market. And this consists of private for profit corporations that are taxed and exist to deliver private goods and services. These corporations are self-regulated, meaning that they can't be controlled by government. And paid boards of directors oversee and act as the fiduciaries for these corporations to make sure that they don't break any laws and spend money appropriately. They exist to share profits with their owners and the work of the corporation is typically managed by a professional business administrator or chief executive officer. The not-for-profit sector and the private not-for-profit corporations that comprise it, fit in between these two sectors. On the public sector side we see health, human services, education, any type of not-for-profit corporation that exist to provide a public mission. In fact, new trends in government you'll see a blurring of the boundaries between the not-for-profit and the public sector as governments contract out the delivery of public goods and services to not-for-profit corporations. On the private goods side of the continuum you see private corporate, not-for-profit corporations that exist to provide private goods and services, and you'll see examples of social purpose businesses, social enterprises, or any type of corporation, trade association, that exists to provide members with certain goods and services. And then there'll be corporations, not-for-profit corporations, in the middle that exist, as I said earlier about the pooling of resources, to provide collective goods and services. And cooperatives are examples of these kinds of not-for-profits. Like the private for profit sector, you see not-for-profit corporations, self-governed, self-regulated. So they can't be controlled by government. And you see that they will be governed by volunteer board of directors. And they will also have, as the sectors professionalize, a professional manager but many of the smaller ones will have volunteer administrators. The final question get set in the role on nonprofit organizations planned society and like the diversity of organizations are deep, diversity of roles depending on the mission of the organization. Some exist to advocate and influence public policy and public policy makers. Others exists to provide important services either to the public or to private members. You'll see nonprofit organizations play important community development role as community organizers empowering the community through different levels of action, and finally as a problem solving role working with other actors, with governments in the market to resolve complex policy issues understanding that government and the sector fulfill complimentary roles. I'll conclude this lecture with some questions for you to consider and discuss in the lecture forum this week. One, what term is commonly used to describe the nonprofit sector in your country? How big is the nonprofit sector in your country? Please feel free to share any research reports and statistics on the size of the nonprofit sector and the types of organizations that comprise it. What are the characteristics of these organizations? Are they professionalized, voluntary, or is there a mixture of the two? [MUSIC] And finally, what roles do nonprofit organizations play in society? Feel free to use these questions as a guide to frame your conversation in the video forum this week. [MUSIC] [SOUND]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nonprofit-organizations/lecture/Ceepn/course-1-overview-video","Course 1 Overview Video","[MUSIC] Hi, I'm professor Yvonne Harrison from the Department of Public Administration and Policy at the University at Albany. Welcoming you to the first course in a series of courses on developing leadership and improving governance in nonprofit organizations. In this video, I will review Course one, Introduction To The Non-Profit Sector, Leadership, and Governance. I'll begin with the learning outcomes and the leadership competencies emphasized in the course and the learning activities that you'll engage in each week. I'll conclude with the assessment of learning that will take place in the fourth and fifth week. By the end of this course, you will have developed knowledge and awareness of the incredible size and scope of the nonprofit sector and the organizations that comprise it. You will have work worked with a real board of directors, or with information from a board of directors, to identify issues, situations and events that challenge the board's effectiveness. And finally, you will have developed skills associated with highly effective nonprofit leaders. This course is designed to introduce you to the leadership competencies required by academic programs that are accredited by NASPAA. And NASPAA is the network of Schools of Public Affairs in North America. This course emphasizes three NASPAA leadership competences. To articulate and apply a public service perspective. To identify governance effectiveness challenges. To communicate and interact productively with and for others. It should be noted that this course was developed with North American requirements in mind. And we do appreciate that the nonprofit sector, nonprofit organizations leadership and governance may not be the same in other parts of the world. It is our intention however, that the course content will be of value to others. And that cultural differences will provide a rich forum for discussion. Now I'll turn to the topics and questions addressed in this course. The topic of week one is the nonprofit sector and nonprofit organizations. Some of the questions we will explore this week are, what is the nonprofit sector, and why does it exist? How is it different from the public and private sectors? What are the unique characteristics of nonprofit organizations? What issues and trends face organizations in the nonprofit sector? The topic of week two is nonprofit leadership, governance and boards of directors. The key questions you will explore this week are what is leadership at the governance level and how is it different from management? What is good governance and why does it matter? What is a board of directors, and how is the role of boards of directors changing? Week three addresses the legal role and authority of board members and responsibilities of boards of directors in organizational governance. The key questions you'll explore this week are what roles do brand members play in nonprofit organizations? What are boards responsible for? What are the different models of organizational governance? And which model is right for the board? Finally, what issues challenge the role and responsibilities of boards in nonprofit organizations? Within the platform, you'll find weekly lectures, videos, readings, and links to external resources that point you to important content. Once you've reviewed the content, you're ready to engage in the learning activities. Take a practice quiz. Based on the required content, the quiz is a chance to test your knowledge and further develop it. Because it is a practice assessment, your scores will not be counted into the final course grade. Post a commentary. Commentaries can be based on an insight from the readings that helped you understand a situation or event that you have experienced. Anything from the reading that you found confusing or unclear could also be posted. Remember, the basic goal is to help you connect the dots by linking your ideas and questions on the topic. Drawing on what you've learned from the readings, and applying it to your own experience. Analyze a nonprofit case. A case is based on a real world situation. Like the real world, there's usually no single crack answer to the issues they raise. The cases assigned in this course are intended to provide you with a chance to reflect and apply concepts from the course. As well as enable you to understand and resolve practical problems in governance work on the course project. The course project is an academic service learning experience that provides you with an opportunity to apply the course content and your learning to help a real board develop leadership and improve governance effectiveness. Whether you gather information from a real board, or you use the information that we gathered. We'll upload instructions and information that you need to complete the work associated with the course project. The end of course assessment of learning will take place in the fourth and fifth week. The first assessment of learning strategy comes from Michelson's method of teaching and learning known as Team-Based Learning. TBL is used to test mastery of course concepts using Readiness Assurance Tests and Application Exercises. In the fourth week, we'll open two multiple choice Readiness Assurance Tests, or RATS as we will humorously refer to throughout the course for you to complete. One RAT will assess knowledge based on reading comprehension and the other will test knowledge application based on a case. In the fifth week, we will encourage you to discuss the RATs in the forums. And to take them again, should you wish to change any of your answers based on the information exchanged. We chose this method of assessment because it is associated with student learning, including concept comprehension, student motivation, communication, accountability, problem solving, and superior academic performance. The second assessment of learning is the board effectiveness assessment reflection, which we will humorously refer to as the BEAR. In a nutshell, the board is a short, written reflection on the nonprofit board and organization you are working with. You will be asked to analyze the organization and board addressing the following questions. What type of nonprofit organization is it? Where is it located? And what type of approach to board governance does it follow? What are the opportunities and threats in the internal and external environment facing the organization? It should include a description of the accountability environment and any regulatory challenges. For example, in New York State, boards are required to have a conflict of interest policy. Does your board have one? Be sure to include an introduction to the reflection and a description of how it's organized. In the fifth week you'll be asked to peer review their assignments. To receive a course grade you must complete peer reviews. In this video we've reviewed course one. Introduction to the nonprofit sector leadership and governance. We've reviewed the learning outcomes, the leadership competencies, the topic and questions, and the learning activities that you'll engage in each week. We've also discussed the end of course assessment of learning that will take place in the fourth and fifth week. For more information please refer to the course content. [MUSIC]",""

Along with my colleague professor Vic Murray at the School of Public Administration at the University of Victoria, And Alina Roddick, Instructional Designer at Empire State College, we want to welcome you to this series of courses on developing leadership and improving governance in nonprofit organizations. By registering for one or more of the courses in this series, you are part of a University at Albany and an open SUNY Innovative Instructional Technology Grant to increase access to nonprofit management and leadership education. In this video, I'll describe why we decided to develop a series of courses on leadership and governance in nonprofit organizations, how the series is structured and the learning within it organized. And what you can do to get the most value out of each course. I'll conclude with our role and some ground rules for engagement. Again, thank you for registering and welcome. Why did we develop a series of courses on developing leaderships and improving governance in non profit organizations? Well we decided to develop a course on improving leadership and governance in non-profit organizations for several reasons. One, I've been teaching this course on-site for many years, and I've also taught it online, and it meets the curricular guidelines for non-profit management and leadership education. Two, this course contains new methods of teaching and learning, academic service learning, and team based learning that have been associated with student development and success. Three, this course also connects to our research on non-profit governance and leadership. And through this research, we've been able to develop a number of open tools and resources for non-profit boards and organizations to improve their leadership and governance effectiveness. And finally, it emphasizes a number of leadership competencies that are required by schools of public affairs. That are accredited by NASPA. And NASPA is the Network of Schools of Public Affairs in North America. How is the series structured and the learning within each course organized? We've organized the series in three, short courses. Each course examines a specific topic, set of questions, and concepts. The first course provides a theory and background to the nonprofit sector. Nonprofit organizations and the concepts of leadership and governance. The second course focuses on the role and responsibility of nonprofit boards of directors and the governance process. And finally the third course examines factors that have been associated with the effectiveness of boards within the governance process. Each course is further broken down into five weeks. During weeks 1 through 3, you will be encouraged to review content, take a practice quiz, reflect on a board case, and post a commentary in the discussion forums. You will also find guidance on the service learning assignment where you will have the opportunity to apply your knowledge to a real world, non-profit governance and leadership situation. Learning will be assessed during the forth and fifth weeks. During the fourth week, you will be asked to submit a written assignment and take two short multiple choice tests. One test will assess course knowledge, while the other assesses application of knowledge within a practical case. In week 5 you'll have the opportunity to discuss the tests and to take them again should you wish to change any of your answers. We'll count the highest test scores into your final course grade. How do you get the most value out of each course? We believe you'll get the most value if you register for each course in the series and you download the required texts. And complete all of the learning activities. This is especially important if you plan to use this for continuing education or to earn course certificates. Finally let me say a few words about our role and some rules for engagement. We've taken the role as facilitators for learning. Bringing to you into one place the latest knowledge and research on a complex subject. All of the people involved are experts in their field and are donating time for a cause they believe in, and that's increasing access to nonprofit management and leadership education And finally I'd just like to go over some rules for engagement. As we launch this series of courses on Coursera's new on demand platform, don't be surprised if there are a few technical difficulties. We're depending on you to communicate those issues to us so that we can respond to them. We ask that when you do communicate those you would communicate them professionally, and be respectful of the people involved. In fact in all interactions in this online community, we ask that you try to emphasize the leadership competencies that we're trying to develop in this course. And most of all, have fun. I wanna thank you for registering and we look forward to seeing you each week. [MUSIC]",""

For most of my life, I've been an active participant in the nonprofit sector, as a volunteer, as a youth coach, as a community organizer, a programme coordinator, and a board member. For the last ten years, my scholarship and teaching has focused on the leadership and governance of nonprofit organizations. And along with my colleague Vic Murray, the school public administration at the University of Victoria, we've designed a course on non-profit governance for students who are preparing for careers in the sector, but also for those who are already working in the non-profit and voluntary sector. Who should take this course? This course is suited for students of nonprofit leadership and philanthropy, students of public administration and business administration who are concentrating in nonprofit management and leadership or social enterprise management. It will also appeal to academic departments looking to add a course to meet nonprofit academic curricular guidelines. It's designed for board members, for executive managers, staff, and consultants, and any external stakeholder that interacts with boards on a regular basis. And is looking, looking for professional development and continuing education. In this course, you'll examine the governance of nonprofit organizations through the lens of a board of directors. You'll examine what boards and leadership volunteers who serve on them do, and how they do it to maximize governance and organizational effectiveness. By the end of this course you'll develop the knowledge, skills and behaviors expected of leaders involved in the governance process. Through a variety of teaching and learning methods that mirror how board members share information and how boards make decisions, you will develop and share knowledge and experience with peers, take tests, and participate in application exercises that relate to specific governance concepts. By working with a real Board of Directors or with information gathered from a Board of Directors you'll be able to apply the knowledge and skills you've learned to help a board achieve a higher level of governance effectiveness. In closing while we set a number of goals and objectives for this course we'll be interested in learning what your goals are, and what we can do to help you meet them. If you have any questions about this course please don't hesitate to contact me. We hope to see you next semester. [MUSIC] [SOUND]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/ell-lesson/lecture/HspXH/summary","Summary","[MUSIC] Welcome back to lesson planning with the ELL in mind. You are about to complete the first module in this course. Let's take a look at all of the information we've covered so far. We started out by discussing what language acquisition really is. It is not formal grammar instruction, but more like learning the language through situations and content. From there, we moved into four key theories of language acquisition that are commonly seen and used with ELLs. The first theory we talked about was Krashen's Silent Period which, on average, lasts from six to nine months. This is that period of time when the ELL student does not speak but is absorbing the language. This can be a difficult time for the student. The most important thing to remember here is to be patient with the student. He or she will come around and begin to speak when ready. Once the student begins showing confidence in speaking, teachers need to let that student have opportunities to speak. Which brings us to the Interaction Hypothesis. The face-to-face communication ELL students have with native English speakers helps them learn to negotiate meaning and learn from mistakes as well as from what the speaker is saying. The next theory was Long's Input Hypothesis. Once the ELL student has some language skills and is showing signs of feeling comfortable, teacher's can begin to present information at their level and a slightly more advanced level. We want to continue modeling the English we need our ELL students to have an order to be successful in the classroom. If we teach them at a lower level, their language skills will not progress. The last theory discussed was Clil. This theory shows teachers how to use the content they are teaching as a means for teaching English to our ELL students. This theory allows teachers to continue teaching what they know how to teach, such as science, math, social studies, or physics. We also talked about BICS and CALP. These are the stage of language acquisitions our ELL students go through. BICS stands for Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills, and is usually one to three years long. Then ELL students move into the CALP stage, which is Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency. Just like it sounds, this is the more academic and technical language ELLs learned at that time. This stage varies in length depending on how much formal education students have in their native language. It can be anywhere from five to seven years, maybe longer. We also looked at ways to identify vocabulary needed to help ELLs understand content material, and talked about ways to make that vocabulary accessible. We looked at the different kinds of vocabulary that we need to consider when planning lessons. There's content obligatory vocabulary, content compatible vocabulary, collocations, and high frequency words. In the last module, we talked about grammatical structures and language functions for our units. As we are planning a unit and pulling out the different kinds of vocabulary, we also need to be aware of what grammar and language our students need to know before teaching the unit or lesson. Language functions are similar, we have to ask ourselves what specific language our ELL students need to know in order not only to understand the lesson, but speak or write about it. Knowing why your ELL student doesn't speak in your class or doesn't do well on assignments and assessments, can be very frustrating to a classroom teacher. This module, hopefully, was able to answer some of those questions and begin to give you some tools to get started in your lesson planning with the ELL in mind.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/ell-lesson/lecture/HUAik/grammatical-structures-and-language-functions","Grammatical Structures and Language Functions","[MUSIC] Hi and welcome back to lesson planning with the ELL in Mind. Today, we are going to take our understanding and application of pre planning tasks one step further, and talk a little bit about the grammatical structures and language functions that are necessary to identify and include in the pre planning process. So we're going to answer the following question. How do I teach grammar in my content? We will break the idea of grammar into two more specific categories. One called grammatical structures, and one called language functions. Even though grammar is so important to the learning of language and to clear and successful communication, it is not the focus of your mainstream or content classroom. Therefore grammar should only be taught in context. You should mindfully choose grammatical structures that are relevant to your day's lesson and teach those structures as chunks of language that the student will need in order to understand the material and to apply their knowledge of the material. When identifying the grammar needed during your pre-planning stages you should focus on both input and output. First, what structures will students need to know to comprehend your text or lecture, the input. Those structures should be provided to students and students should understand the meaning of those structures prior to the lesson. Second, what structures will students need to know in order to produce a written task or complete an assignment. The output. You might provide additional support through close or gap activities so students can demonstrate their knowledge of the content without mastery of the language. Students will also need support in recognizing and correcting their errors within the structures that you have focused on in an academic lesson. Let's look at a few examples using the content Math. Students may need to know present tense verbs in order to define a general rule in Math such as, a square has four equal sides. They may also need to know modal verbs in order to express the process of a Math application. For example, you have to multiply the length times the width to find the area of a square. Finally they may need to know conditionals in order to express a general truth. For example, if you divide any number by itself, then the value is always 1. Next, let's take a look at the language functions which are really the purpose for output or what you want the students to do with learned information. In other words, the language the student needs to be able to produce or communicate their ideas within the content successfully and coherently. These language functions, much like the collocations in some of the vocabulary required by your content and grammar, should also be taught in chunks. We can think of some very common language functions that apply to many content areas such as giving examples, maybe of freshwater fish. Describing a process, such as the water cycle and expressing conditionals, if I do this, then this will happen. Describing trends, possibly of a weather pattern or population growth talking about purpose or perhaps the nervous system or even just defining a term or idea. Other important language functions include expressing agreement or disagreement, clarifying, expressing opinions, predicting and making suggestions. Again, you will want to designate a place in your lesson plan for grammatical structures and language functions. This will help focus of planning of your lesson's activities. In the next video, we will provide you with specific ways to plan for the teaching of these grammatical structures and language functions.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/ell-lesson/lecture/MtYwR/classroom-application-vocabulary-for-ells","Classroom Application-Vocabulary for ELLs","[MUSIC] Hi and welcome back to Lesson Planning With The ELL In Mind. Today we are excited to take a look at our first classroom application for preplanning with a focus on vocabulary. Today's lesson will answer the question, how can I make vocabulary meaningful for my ELL students? In the last lesson we covered how to find and choose appropriate vocabulary to teach your ELL. Now what do you do with it? How do you teach it? How do you make it work for your students and how do they apply it to the content? We're going to take a look at just a couple of ways that have been proven successful for ELL students in the content classroom. The first application is a personal dictionary. This works well at any level and at any grade and is fairly self directed. The students can create a personal dictionary that helps them keep a bank of words that are related to the content. This can be done in a notebook, using a web application or some kind of technical device such as Dropbox or a Google doc. Depending on their familiarity, access or competency with technology. At each level we can require or ask students to provide different elements of the language in order to help them remember vocabulary. For example, in a lower elementary class, the student might provide a word, a picture, a sentence and maybe a synonym or antonym. In an upper elementary class, they might provide a word, a self-written definition, synonyms, antonyms, and maybe word forms. At the middle or high school level, maybe they include the word, a part of speech, the definition, a sentence, synonym, antonym, and a word form. With each level, the dictionary is getting a bit more complex. This activity is very good for content obligatory vocabulary and provides the student with something they can look back at or refer to and use as a study guide. The second way to make vocabulary more accessible in the content classroom is to provide any type of visual aid or pictures to define the word. Oftentimes, the student knows the concept but they don't know the word in English. This is a quick way to do that. Another way to use visual aids is as an anticipatory set. Where you might present an image related to your lesson and create questions that require the review or the introduction to new vocabulary. The ELL student is then hearing the vocabulary words from his or her peers prior to the lesson and can start to become familiar with them before any formal direct instruction. The use of this activity is well supported by input and interaction hypothesis. Let's take a look at a example. If we're in a social studies class we might project this image of hieroglyphics. Probably for most students, this image is familiar. They may have studied it already in another class or seen it in a documentary or a movie. But somewhere in their life they've run across hieroglyphics. So we present this image and we present a series of questions. What is the image of? What do you think the message of the image is? Where is the image from? And who created this image? Then ask students to write two questions the students would like to ask the person who created this image. We can imagine a natural conversation, a natural classroom discussion. We're going to hear words like hieroglyphics, images, pictures, messages, communications, Egyptians, prehistoric. Any words the students can come up with to ignite language for your ELLs. Other ways we can apply vocabulary is using word maps and diagrams. We can create word maps for students and ask them to create connections to words that are related to the words you are trying to teach them. Students can also create word maps independently. For example, in another social studies class, you may need to teach the word geography. If geography is the center of our word map or diagram, students might branch off with the words landform and they list words such as valley, mountain, and mesa. They might also include water and list words such as river, lake, or ocean. You can make these as detailed as necessary and work with them long term adding new words over the course of a unit. You may even modify this assignment for a more basic level language learner through the use of pictures and visuals. Another idea for introducing and sustaining vocabulary you may already use, is the word wall. Creating a word wall allows students to continuously build on vocabulary and make new connections, groups and collocations. Vocabulary can also be reviewed using kinesthetic strategies or total physical response and matching activities. We hope that these strategies are workable for you in your classroom. We will continue to build on these classroom applications as the course progresses.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/ell-lesson/lecture/OgkNm/vocabulary-for-ells","Vocabulary for ELLs","[MUSIC] Hi, and welcome back to lesson planning with the ELL in mind. Today, we are going to continue with our pre-lesson planning strategies with the focus on vocabulary building with the ELL student, keeping in mind BICS and CALP which we covered in the last lesson. And also keeping in mind the importance of input in second language acquisition and the input at the correct level for the student. So our lesson today hopes to answer the question, what words do my ELL students need in order to be successful in my class? When we are thinking about vocabulary, we can categorize words in a couple of different ways. The first category of vocabulary is called Content Obligatory Vocabulary. These are words that are essential to mastering the learning outcomes of a lesson. Usually, these words are already highlighted in a text book and are often found in a glossary. Often these words are new to all students in the class, so come naturally in the pre-planning stages of lesson delivery. Many times these words appear on assessments so it's very important that we spend some time to ensure our ELL students are familiar with these more difficult sets of vocabulary. Content Obligatory Vocabulary often falls under the CALP realms. So our ELL students might need a little more support in understanding these words as they can often be abstract. Let's take a look at some examples of content obligatory vocabulary. In math, words like multiply and circumference would be considered obligatory. These are words the student must know and understand completely in order to fully complete an activity or solve a problem. For a subject such as social studies, we can identify words such as continent and the electoral college as obligatory. Again, these are important words for communicating about or thinking about different aspects in social studies. In science, words such as atom, mass and molecule are obligatory in order for the student to understand concepts. The second set of vocabulary is called Content Compatible Vocabulary. This is less specialized vocabulary, but it's still really important to the subject. The student might have seen these words elsewhere, and so might use them to communicate a higher level concept within that subject. Sometimes these vocabulary words are recycled from other lessons, and even previous grades. The student might already know them, or be aware of them due to life experiences. We don't often assess Content Compatible Vocabulary, but students should know them and use them in the lesson. Students may use these words in place of more difficult or higher content obligatory words. Often these words fall in the BICS realm and some of them move more towards CALP as they get more complex. Examples of content compatible vocabulary words are using the same subjects, circle, measure and any number one, two, three, four in math. These are all content compatible. We use them in a subject, but they are not the main focus of the subject. Content compatible words in social studies could be president or mountain. Students may know them from everyday conversation, but could apply them in a social studies lesson. In science, words such as fact, cycle, and weather are content compatible. Students will see them often in everyday life, they may have even used them in prior lessons, and they might help them explain certain concepts that are at a more difficult or higher level. The next set of words is called Collocations, these are words or phrases that are often taught together. They are often specific to content or to a lesson. It's important to teach these words as a chunk of language rather than individual words. It will be easier for the student to learn the chunk or the phrase as it appears in context and as it is used in context in your classroom. Some examples of Collocations that appear in our same subjects might be words or phrases such as sharp rise in math, or the sum of blank is blank in math, where you see the chunk of words together. In social studies we have words or ideas such as political party or balanced budget. In science, we can think of laws of physics, or laws of some other concept, and a phrase such as chemical reaction. Our final type of vocabulary is vocabulary that students use across the curriculum and in everyday life. These include high frequency words such as prepositions, verbs, and common adverbs, such as many, few, and always. They also include higher level academic vocabulary, such as create, define, analyze, or other words related to Bloom's Taxonomy. Students will need these words in order to access your content successfully. It's important to spend some time with your textbook, prior to lesson planning delivery, and focus in on different types of vocabulary that will be essential for your students to be successful in your lesson. So to review, there are four categories of vocabulary words you will need to identify and to teach your ELLs. The first is content obligatory, or words that are essential to mastering the material. The second is content compatible, or words that are found within the content of the lesson but are also used in everyday life. The third category is collocations, these are phrases or chunks of language necessary for learning the content and could be found in common language outside of the classroom. High frequency words make up our last category and include words that are found in everyday life and across the curriculum. It is important to designate a space on your lesson plan for these categories and the words that will need to be taught.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/ell-lesson/lecture/wgrdA/bics-calp-scenarios","BICS & CALP Scenarios","[MUSIC] Hi, and welcome back to lesson planning with the ELL in mind. Today we are going to provide you with some scenarios and various students and classroom situations. This is an opportunity for you to apply what you learned about BICS and CALPs. While there will be in-video quiz questions, this is not a graded assignment. Let's get started. You will read each scenario. Then, identify which set of language skills, BICS or CALP, are required for the student to successfully complete the task. A brief explanation will follow your answer. Scenario 1. A primary student is studying food types. They are asked to complete a handout that requires them to classify food on the food pyramid. They must place the picture of the food in the correct section of the pyramid. They are then asked to draw a picture of a healthy meal. If you chose BICS, you are correct. While a student is performing a higher level task of classifying information, the language required is basic vocabulary. Little production, speaking or writing of language is required. Scenario 2. A high school student in a life science class is asked to write an essay analyzing changes in an ecosystem and explain the impact of climate and human activity. The student must include a visual to support his/her analysis. If you chose CALP, you are correct. The language demands of this assignment is very content specific, and requires the ability to communicate abstract ideas. Scenario 3. A middle school math student is studying algebra and functions. They are asked to plot information on a graph using given coordinates. After connecting the coordinates, the student must discuss their interpretation of the trend with a partner. If you chose BICS, you are correct. The student can complete this task with minimal academic language. They may begin to use academic language, such as increase or decrease, but could certainly fulfill the demands of the interpretation with more everyday vocabulary such as go up or down or less and more.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/oI2Fz/1-4-controlling-the-spread-of-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria","1.4 Controlling the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria","Thousands of people die every day from infections acquired while receiving health care. As we've already stated, hands are the main pathway of germs transmission in health care. Hand hygiene is the number one most important measure to stop the transmission of harmful germs and to prevent health care associated infections. Shown here are the five moments for hand hygiene developed by the World Health Organization. Let's take a minute to look at each moment in more detail. The first moment for hand hygiene occurs when you enter the resident zone and before touching the resident. Performing hand hygiene here protects the resident against colonization, and in some cases, against infections by harmful germs carried by your hands. An example of a situation where this would be appropriate is before assisting a resident with personal care activities. The second moment for hand hygiene occurs before you perform any clean or aseptic procedure. This is done to protect the resident against infection with bad bugs, including their own germs, entering his or her body. An example of a situation where this would apply would be before preparing food, medications, injections, or dressing a wound. The third moment occurs any time there is a body fluid exposure risk. Performing hand hygiene here protects you from colonization or infection with the resident's harmful germs and protects the healthcare environment from the spread of germs. A good example of this would be after cleaning an incontinent resident, emptying a urinary catheter bag, changing soiled bed linen or checking a blood sugar. The fourth moment happens after you have touched the resident. Hand hygiene at this moment protects you from colonization and infection and protects the health care environment from the spread of germs. A good example for this opportunity would be after performing a physical exam or assisting a resident with personal care needs. The fifth moment for hand hygiene occurs any time you touch the resident's surroundings. This protects you from colonization and infection with resident germs that may be present on surfaces or objects in the resident's surroundings and protects the healthcare environment against germs spread. A good example of this would be after any activity involving physical contact with the resident's immediate environment, like changing bed linens, holding a bed rail, clearing a bedside table, or even leaning against the bed. It is important that you take every opportunity to perform hand hygiene to keep a resident, yourself, and the environment free from germs. You should always use an alcohol based hand rub for hand hygiene unless your hands are visibly soiled. To effectively reduce the growth of germs on hands, you should have enough product in your hands to wet all surfaces of your hands for at least 20 to 30 seconds. You should wash your hands with anti bacterial soap and water when they are visibly soiled or after caring for a resident with diarrhea. Otherwise, use an alcohol based hand rub. You should was your hands for a minimum 15 seconds with soap and water. You should follow the steps described here to effectively wash your hands. Standard precautions are a cornerstone of infection control. They are based on the assumption that all moist body fluids from all residents are colonized or infected with one or more bad bugs. The general rule of thumb is that if it is warm, wet and not yours, standard precautions apply. We have already reviewed hand hygiene, the first element of standard precautions. We will review some of the elements of standard precautions that are important for preventing the spread of bad bugs. Gowns, gloves, and mask are also an important aspect of standard precautions and further prevent the spread of bad bugs when they are utilized appropriately. They are intended to protect the user from contamination and should always be used when there's potential for contact with blood or potentially contaminated body fluids such as urine or stool. Hand hygiene should always be performed before putting on personal protective equipment or PPE. And following removal. Gloves should be worn anytime there is anticipated contact with blood or other potentially infectious material. Glove should be changed during resident care if the hands move from a dirty body site like the groin to a clean body site, like the face. The same pair of gloves should not be used for more than one patient and should never be washed and reused. Hands should be washed after glove removal. Gowns are used to protect the user's clothes and bare skin from contamination that could occur during resident care. Like with gloves, gowns should be worn when there is the potential for contamination of the skin or clothes during resident care. Gowns should not be reused or used for multiple residents, even those in the same room. Mask and eye protection should be worn when there is potential for splash or spray of blood, respiratory secretions, or other body fluids. Masks should be changed if they become wet and discarded after care of the resident. You may be able to disinfect and reuse eye protection depending on the manufacturer. Another very important part of controlling the spread of bad bugs is room placement. A private room is preferred for residents who are colonized or infected with a bad bug. If a private room is not available, the next best option is to place the colonized or infected resident into a room with another resident with the same type of bad bug. Meaning MRSA positive resident rooms with an MRSA positive resident or VRE with VRE. Residents with two different bad bugs should never be put in the same room together. The third option is to place a resident with the bad bug in a room with the healthiest resident possible because the healthiest resident has the lowest risk for getting the bad bug. A clean resident care environment is as important as hand hygiene in preventing the transmission of bad bugs in nursing homes. We all ready know that residents with bad bugs such as MRSA and VRE, have the bacteria present on all or parts of their skin. These bacteria shed onto environmental surfaces such as bed rails and table tops and the resident's immediate environment. These organisms can survive on dry environmental surfaces from several hours to many weeks and serve as a source of hand, glove, and clothing contamination. All surfaces and equipment should be cleaned with an EPA registered hospital surface disinfectant. Daily cleaning of surfaces within the residents immediate environment, shared resident care equipment, and common areas, lowers the level of contamination and the risk of cross transmission is reduced. Similarly, thoroughly cleaning a room after a resident is discharged protects the next resident who will be occupying the room from potentially getting a bad bug. Soiled linens such as sheets, towels, incontinence pads and patient gowns, are contaminated with bad bugs even if visible soil is not evident. All linen should be handled with care and as little agitation as possible to avoid contamination of the air, surfaces, and people in the immediate area. Linen should be placed immediately into a leak resistant container and should not be sorted or placed in any surface prior to containment. Just as it is important for staff to maintain their hygiene, it is also very important that residents are able to maintain their hygiene. This includes bathing residents regularly, insuring that incontinence care is done appropriately and thoroughly, and residents wash their hands frequently, including before and after eating, before and after group activities and after using the bathroom. For relatively healthy residents, such as those who are mainly independent, standard precautions may be all that are needed. Making sure that gloves and gowns are used for contact with uncontrolled secretions, pressure draining wounds, stool incontinence and ostomy tubes or bags. When there are ill residents such as those totally dependent upon healthcare personnel for health care and activities of daily living and for those residents whose infected secretions or drainage cannot be contained, standard precautions alone may not be enough to control the spread of bad bugs. This is when additional measures are added to standard precautions, called Contact Precautions. Contact Precautions are an extension of standard precautions, in that gowns and gloves are required for all resident contacts, as well as contact with the environmental surfaces in the residents room. After viewing this program you know know that antibiotic resistant bacteria are common in nursing homes causing frequent colonization and 10% of all in factions in nursing homes. You also know that by practicing good hand hygiene and standard precautions, you protect the residents, yourself and the nursing home environment from the spread of bad bugs. If you have any questions related to infection control, you should contact your facility's infection preventionist for advice and assistance. Thank you for viewing this module and good luck with your infection prevention efforts.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/Y8aE2/1-3-understanding-how-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria-spread","1.3 Understanding how antibiotic resistant bacteria spread","A reservoir is a place where bacteria hang out. There are many different reservoirs in the nursing home setting, including the residents, health care personnel and surfaces and shared patient equipment. All of these can harbor bad bugs and be the source of transmission to a resident. Colonization is defined as the presence of multiplying bacteria on host tissues that are in contact with the outside environment, like the skin, nose, and intestines. But does not cause signs and symptoms of infection, such as redness, puss or fever. With colonization, the bacteria are happy and thriving and the host is not aware of their presence. Infection is the invasion of bacteria in to normally sterile tissue with clinical signs and symptoms of infection present such as fever, redness or pus. With infection, the bacteria continue to remain happy, but are also now producing toxins and other products that are making the host sick. Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a serious issue for nursing homes. Studies have demonstrated that many residents are colonized with these bad bugs when they are admitted to nursing homes. It was estimated that 25% of residents in these studies were colonized with MRSA and 25% to 67% were colonized with VRE. This is a large reservoir of bad bugs that could lead to transmission to other residents. Once a resident is colonized, they will continue to carry those same antibiotic resistant bacteria for long periods of time. Estimates place the carriage duration for MRSA between three months and three years. And three to four months for VRE. Similar to MRSA, ESBL E.coli has a carriage duration of three months to four years. Again this long period of carriage increases the risk of transmission. Many residents may be colonized with more than one type of antibiotic resistant bacteria. This suggests that nursing homes can become reservoirs for multiple strains of antibiotic resistant bacteria when persistently colonized residents are accepted and transferred from many different outside facilities like other nursing homes or hospitals. Given that there is a high rate of colonization in nursing homes, how is it that some residents become colonized while others do not? When colonized residents are compared to non colonized residents, a variety of factors have been associated with an increased risk of colonization with antibiotic resistant bacteria. These include an underlying illness, presence of an invasive device, like a feeding tube, an IV, or a urinary catheter, prior antibiotic use, the presence of wounds, a decline in functional status, and an increased intensity of nursing care. Another contributing factor in nursing homes for residents acquiring antibiotic resistant bacteria is colonization pressure. Colonization pressure occurs when there is a large reservoir of residents with resistant bacteria, creating more opportunities for these bacteria to be passed from an infected resident to a non-infected resident. As we discussed in a previous slide there are already a lot of residents in nursing homes who are already colonized or infected when they are admitted to a facility making for a ready source of transmission. Residents get bad bugs from multiple sources. The main way these bad bugs are spread is by the hands of healthcare personnel. The hands of healthcare personnel can spread bad bugs by touching one infected resident and then touching another resident without washing their hands. It can also occur by indirect contact when a healthcare provider touches a contaminated surface or piece of equipment and then touches a resident without washing their hands. Similarly, residents can spread bad bugs in the same way to each other if they fail to wash their hands after they become contaminated. When a resident is found to be colonized or infected with a bad bug, a delicate balance is required to protect the residents quality of life, while protecting other residents from getting a bad bug. Let's check back at Sunnyside to see how they managed this delicate balance. >> Previously on Gowns & Gloves, nurse Priscilla breaks the news to Mr.Houston that his wife has been exposed and colonized with MRSA. Will Elaine become infected with MRSA? And what's going on between Dimitri and Priscilla? Find out on Gowns & Gloves. [MUSIC] [SOUND] >> Hi, I'm Vanessa. Priscilla's with another resident. She asked me to come in and talk to Mrs. Houston about the precautions that we'll be taking to help control the spread of MRSA here at Sunny Side. You're currently on standard precautions which is what we use for everyone here at the facility. >> We noticed when we were moved down here a lot of people had carts outside their rooms and signs on their doors. >> Yes, those residents have been placed under contact precautions. We use contact precautions for residents with infections from bacteria like MRSA to help control the spread between residents. I can't tell you about their specifics, but that is what those signs and carts indicate. >> I don't understand this scene at all. Why don't I have one of those signs or carts outside my room? >> At the moment your character is colonized, which means that you have the MRSA bacteria on your skin and in your nose. You don't have an active infection like some of the other residents. That's why it's not necessary right now. >> For you to be put on contact precautions, and put a sign on the door. See, the main thing is that the staff wear gloves, practice good hand hygiene, and never share personal items between residents. >> So, what do I do now that I'm colonized? Well Vanessa will be relaying all the information for what your character is to do. Again, the main thing is to practice good hand hygiene. Wash with antiseptic soap and water or an FDA approved alcohol-based hand gel. >> Great, good hand hygiene, I get that. Now, we ready, action. >> Mrs.Houston, since you're on stand up precaution, all staff will need to wear gloves when providing care for you, and wash their hands before, and after caring for you. If you see us and we're not washing our hands or using an alcohol based hand gel, you need to remind us. You two, both of you need to make sure that you wash your hands before leaving the room, and after you return to it. >> This is painful, I feel as though I'm being punished. And what happens If I want to have visitors or leave the room. >> Right now there is no restriction on your movement throughout the facility. Just make sure you wash your hands before you leave the room and before you participate in any activity. The same rules apply to you too Mr. Houston. Is there anything else I can help you out with? >> No, I just wish Priscilla were here. >> Elaine, that is so rude. >> But, I still feel that I'm being punished. I'm being penalized for something that I'm not responsible for. Please leave. >> But Mrs. Hughes. >> I said, get out! [MUSIC] I can't be isolated at the end of this hall. It ruins our plan. >> Not so fast, darling. We could use this to our advantage. Yes, it's me. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/nX28u/1-2-understanding-antibiotic-resistance","1.2 Understanding antibiotic resistance","There are many antibiotic resisting strains of bacteria that can colonize or infect nursing home residents, but there are three that are most common. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus or MRSA. Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci or VRE and Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producing E.coli or ESBL E.coli. Staphylococcus aureus or Staph is a very common germ that about 1 out of every 3 people has on their skin or in their nose, but only 2% of those carry MRSA. This germ does not cause any problems for most people who have it on their skin. But sometimes it can cause serious infections, such as skin or wound infections, pneumonia, or infections in the blood. Antibiotics are given to kill staph germs when they cause infections. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus, or MRSA, is a type of staph that is resistant to some of the antibiotics that are often used to treat staph infections, making it tougher to treat. Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci, VRE are a type of bacteria called Enterococci that have developed resistance to the many antibiotics especially Vancomycin. Enterococcus bacteria live in our intestines, usually without causing problems. Enterococcus bacteria become a problem when they cause infection. These infections can occur anywhere in the body. Some common sites include the gal bladder, the urinary tract, and wounds. For some people, especially those who are weak or ill, these infections can become serious. E.coli are a very common bacteria that normally live harmlessly in the gut and are one of the most common bacteria causing infections in humans, particularly urinary tract infections, or UTIs. These infections can sometimes progress to cause more serious infections such as kidney infections, or spread to the blood which can be life threatening. ESBL producing strains are bacteria that produce an enzyme called extended-spectrum beta lactamase, which makes them more resistant to many commonly used antibiotics, and makes the infections harder to treat. In many instances, only a very limited group of antibiotics remain effective against ESBL producing E.coli. Bacteria that are resistant to the effects of certain antibiotics are more difficult to treat. The bad news is that bacteria are becoming more resistant, not less. So a microbe that is resistant to many drugs becomes difficult or even impossible to treat. Because antibiotic-resistant bacteria are more difficult to treat, residents that become infected by one or more bad bugs often do worse and are sicker for longer periods of time. This is due in part to delays in detection and correct treatment, and the presence of multiple medical conditions that are made worse by the infection. Because nursing home residents live in close proximity to other persons, and interact often, antibiotic resistant bacteria can spread quickly among residents. The quick spread may also be attributable to frequent contact with potentially contaminated surfaces and persons. Nursing home residents are frequently colonized with one or more antibiotic resistant bacteria. A majority of these are already colonized or infected when they are admitted. This is a concern because the more residents colonized or infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the more likely transmission between residents will occur. >> Previously on gown and gloves, the MRSA outbreak continues to spread. And rumors of improper standard precautions are spreading like wildfire. Is it possible that someone isn't washing their hands could the spread of MRSA have been stopped in it's tracks? And how is Mrs. Houston going to like her new room in the MRSA contaminated wing? Find out on Gowns and Gloves. [MUSIC] >> I'm ready, oh am I ready. But you know what, I still can't believe we got Doctor Kennedy to admit me a here after my hip surgery. But you know what, we won't have long before they discharge me, so we better act very quickly. >> Mm. It's fortunate that we're here. I've arranged with the director of nurses to have Priscilla be our nurse for the day, so we can get some one-on-one time with her. >> You're kidding. You gotta be- >> Good for, you're gonna be great darling. >> [SOUND] Hi, sorry to interrupt. Mr. Houston, may I speak with you for a moment in the hallway? >> Yes, what is it? >> I need to tell you something important about your wife. Remember a few days ago when I took that swab of her nose. >> Yes. >> Well, we were looking for bacteria called MRSA. It turns out she has it. >> Cut. >> Really? >> Actually, you need to clarify here. Mrs. Houston is colonized, not infected. She has the bacteria on her body, but isn't showing symptoms of infection. Residents who are colonized and have wounds are more likely to become infected. Think of it like this, let's try this very simple example. Think of a swimming pool as you, your body. And the folks sitting on the deck of the pool, well they're the germs just relaxing in the sun. Well, that's colonization. The MRSA bacteria is alive and well and perfectly happy just sitting on the sidelines, like in your nose, your armpits, your groin, on the outside of your body. Well, as time passes, the pool starts to look pretty inviting. A few folk jump in, and before you know it, there's a crazy party going on in the pool. Well, that's like infection. The MRSA bacteria has invaded your sterile tissue, which is the pool, and is now begun to thrive and multiply, causing symptoms of MRSA infection, which makes you sick. >> That's really interesting. Let's set up and go again. Ready? >> [COUGH] >> Come on. >> [COUGH] >> And action. >> We were looking for a bacterium called MRSA when we took a swab of your wife's nose. It did show that she's colonized with MRSA. >> Colonized? >> Yes, the bacterium is in her nose, which likely indicates to us that it's on her skin and in other parts of her body, as well. >> Sounds serious. How did she get it? >> Well- >> Cut. >> Really? >> Demetri. You're scared in the scene. I wanna see it in your face. >> Demetri, the reason you are scared is that MRSA is a resistant bacteria that if it causes infection it causes folks to get sicker and stay sick for longer. Yeah, so infected residents are also more likely to die from this type of resistant infections than nonresistant forms of the same bacteria. Your wife is at an increased risk because of the wound that she has from surgery. It makes it easier for the MRSA to get past the skin barrier and cause a serious infection. >> So remember, remember, concerned, here. And [SOUND]. >> It sounds so serious. What do we do to protect Elaine? >> I'm glad you asked. As a precautionary measure to our other residence, we're going to be moving Mrs. Houston down the hall to a private room, to reduce the risk of spreading the MRSA to other residence. We will be moving her shortly, and then I'll be back to tell you what's going on, and what you can do to help. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/Q5382/1-1-defining-antibiotic-resistance","1.1 Defining antibiotic resistance","Welcome to module 1, Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria. Our ability to treat normal bacterial infections, only goes back more than 70 years to the development of prontosil, sulfa drug in the 1930s. In that short timeframe, increasing resistance to these wonder drugs because of overuse and misuse has led to the rise of superbugs, or bad bugs that are not treatable by any antibiotic. Antibiotic resistance has the potential to recreate a world where people routinely die from simple bacterial infections. This module will describe antibiotic resistant bacteria, how they affect the residents in your facility, and what you can do to help control their spread. There are five learning objectives for this module. You should be able to define antibiotic resistant bacteria. Identify several types of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Define the terms colonization, and infection. Name at least two risk factors for getting an antibiotic resistant bacteria. Identify the #1 way to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance bacteria. Before we get started, it is important that we define a few key terms that will be important throughout this module. Antibiotics are drugs that fight infections caused by bacteria. Antibiotics work by killing the bacteria, or stopping their growth. Bacteria are microorganisms too small to see with the naked eye, that exist in virtually all environments in the world. Including on and inside the bodies of virtually every living animal on Earth. Most bacteria are not harmful, but some bacteria can cause infections, like strep throat. Antibiotic resistance is the ability of bacteria to survive exposure to one, or more antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria change in some way that reduces, or eliminates the ability of the drug to fight the infection. Antibiotic resistant infections kill more Americans than HIV/AIDS, and the number of lives claimed continues to rise. More than 2,000,000 acquire antibiotic resistant infections in the US each year, and more than 100,000 die as a result. In nursing homes, the number affected is still no less shocking. On average, there are 3.2 million residents currently in nursing homes. Of these, 250,000 acquire infections during their stay. Around 10%, or 27,000 of these infections are caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. Once antibiotic resistant bacteria, like MRSA or VRE, are established in a facility, they are rarely eliminated. Let's see how antibiotic resistant bacteria are affecting residents at Sunnyside Nursing Home. >> Previously on gowns & gloves, a mysterious outbreak seems to be wreaking havoc in Sunnyside Retirement Home. Will the staff get the outbreak, and their residents under control? [SOUND] Will the residents put up with the precautions they're going to need to follow? And will Elaine Houston find the truth about her past? Find out on gowns & gloves. [MUSIC] >> Volunteering, so give me an update. What's going on? >> Well, Vanessa, I think we have a problem. We have several patients who seem to have similar infections, Mr. Lawrence, Ms. McCoy, and Mr. Mayhall, all have infection with mersa. >> That does seem to be an issue? When did you first noticed the problem? >> When I came on my shift, I look at the chart and I noticed that all the patients have had positive cultures within the past two weeks, they all have it. >> Slow down. Who was the first resident to test positive? >> When Mrs. McCoy was admitted from the hospital, she came with a mersa infection. About four days later, her next door neighbor Mr. Lawrence had a bed sore that became infected with mersa. You know he's debilitated, and needs total care. Then Mr. Lawrence's roommate, Mr. Mayhall become colonized with mersa. And Elaine Houston, she must have become colonized when she was admitted here for rehab for her hip surgery. >> We need to take action. There's an infection control breakdown somewhere. What have we done about these residents? Didn't we place infected residents on contact precautions? Is anyone in this place washing their hands? >> I know, why are we still having transmission between residents? >> I don't know, [SOUND] what are we gonna do to stop this outbreak from happening? >> And cut. [SOUND] All right, good. But this time, when we do it, I want you to do it with passion, all right? This is serious news you're hearing. We have a lot of sick residents here. >> Jack is right, everyone. Hi guys, I'm Jane Walker. I'm the content expert here to make sure that we've got all the information correct. And it's not just that these residents are sick. They have a bacterial infection called MRSA that is resistant to most commonly used antibiotics. And because it is resistant to many antibiotics, if they have MSRA, it's more likely to continue to spread, and which is, like a snowballing effect. Oh, and one more thing. When you're saying it, we need you to say, MRSA not mersa, okay? >> Okay, you got it, ready? And action. [SOUND] >> Priscilla, let's move deposited MRSA cases down the hall, and place infected residents on contact precautions Is there anything else we can do? >> Cut. >> Great job. Okay, guys. I need you all to focus on everyone. Staff, and residents washing their hands. Okay? Now, I like to talk about the standard precautions, and contact precautions, but good hand hygiene is the number one way to stop the spread of MRSA bacteria. And you need to convey that to your residents. >> So, my character is all about hand washing? >> Yes. Good hand washing is the single most important way to prevent the spread of MRSA, and other antibiotic resistant bacteria. >> And action. >> We need to focus on hand hygiene across the board, residents and staff. It's the only possible way Mrs. Houston could have come down with something, since arriving here at Sunnyside. We need to get her moved down the hall with the rest of the MRSA patients, and get this contained as soon as possible. >> Oh, [LAUGH] she is not going to like that. >> No, she's not. I'll go to get her prepped to move, as well as talk to the staff about gowning, and gloving properly. We need to make sure standard precaution is followed, and that the contact precaution sign is on all of the infected residents' doors. Oh, and make sure you talk to Mrs. Houston's husband. He hasn't left her side all week. Family members need to know what they can do to help prevent the spread as well. >> Mr. and Mrs. Houston, there's something about them I just can't quite put my finger on. [MUSIC]",""

SPICE promotes prevention and control of healthcare associated infections in North Carolina and beyond, by providing evidence based education and consultation across the healthcare spectrum. Our vision is for all healthcare personnel to comprehend the life saving importance of their roles, and eliminating health care associated infections, and execute their job duties with an informed infection protection lens. With that in mind, SPICE developed six education modules that would make an impact on infection prevention control and health care facilities and beyond. And Most importantly, make them entertaining. Videos employing professional actors engage and educate viewers as important infection control concepts are highlighted. Antibiotic resistant bacteria and isolation precautions are the topics of modules one and two, and feature gowns and gloves. A tongue in cheek soap opera that takes place in a nursing home. In module three, injection safety and safe diabetes care, you'll watch contestants compete in a reality game show called the technique, and learn the best technique for practices in injection safety and safe diabetes care. In module four and infomercial educates about correct practices for environmental cleaning and disinfection. And for modules five and six, gowns and gloves soap opera is back to shine in the spotlight on urinary tract infection and clostridium difficile.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/VyzrH/behavioral-addictions","Behavioral Addictions",">> Hello. In this lecture, we're going to consider behavioral addictions. This is about addictions without drugs. It's about disorders where there's an excessive behavior, for example, with gambling, internet use or perhaps shopping. We often hear people say that they are addicted to eating certain kinds of food or that they're addicted to watching certain television shows. People have written books about their various addictions. People have asked me if I thought that their internet use was an addiction. Before we can responsibly say that something is addicting, there has to be a scientific study of that problem. It has to be clearly demonstrated that that behavior in some people has the characteristics of a brain disorder or addiction. At this time we can say that there is evidence for gambling as an addictive disorder. And it seems likely that in the future there will be more evidence and some additional behaviors will be considered an addiction that may require treatment for some people. What have we learned about gambling that allows us to classify it as an addiction for some people? Well, it's been shown that gambling can be a persistent behavior that causes harmful effects in life. The harmful effects, of course, can be a loss of money such that you don't meet your obligations, like paying the rent or buying food for your family. In addition to gambling away money that you need, there are some other characteristics. For example, you haven't been able to cut back or stop and you experience stress when you try to stop. You may lie or try to conceal how much you gamble and you may gamble after episodes of stress. As with other addictions, you may be able to walk away from gambling for some time, but then relapse. Studies have documented that there are people who behave in this way and who benefit from treatment. You may have recognized that many of the characteristics of gambling disorder are similar to those for drug abuse disorders or addictions. I refer to continued use in spite of negative consequences and relapses after or during stress. These will be among the criteria for all addictions. Can you get help or treatment for gambling? Of course you can. You only have to find a suitable treatment provider. What if you're involved with internet use or shopping or sex to the point where it's causing personal distress because of harmful consequences? Even though these behaviors may not be officially classified as addictions right now, you can still get treatment for these problems if you need it. So, in that sense, it doesn't matter if the behavior is officially described as a disorder or an addiction. If you have a problem, help is available. In summary, here are three main points. Certain behaviors can be addictive in the sense that you continue to do them again and again even though they have harmful consequences. The main behavior that this has been documented for is gambling. In the future, other behaviors are likely to be established as addictive disorders for some as well. If you're involved in a behavior that is somehow destructive to you, you can still get help from a treatment professional no matter what it is. After this lecture, I'd like you to go to the internet and look at various sites that deal with gambling as an addiction, and I'd like you to focus on two different kinds of sites. The first type I'd like you to look at are those that describe gambling as an addiction. What do they say about it? The next kind of site that I'd like you to look at are the treatment sites. Identify one or two places or groups that treat gambling. Are there different kinds of gambling treatment? I think you will see that there is much available having to do with gambling as an addiction. Finally, let me briefly review the topics covered in this first week. The definition of addiction and abuse has been described. I've talked about how drug use has persisted throughout history and what that may mean. It's been noted that the brain, the organ of behavior, is central to the addiction problem. Many kinds of drugs and some behaviors can be addicting and this can be very detrimental both economically and personally. There's more to come on each of these ideas in future lectures.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/oZ5Pw/drug-use-a-serious-problem","Drug Use: A Serious Problem","It's time to consider how serious a problem this is. Let's look at some data gathered by various government agencies. This data is from SAMHSA from 2010 and 2011. These percentages show the fraction of people aged 12 and older who took various drugs over their lifetime. You can see that alcohol has a very high percentage. More than 80% of all people aged 12 or older have used alcohol in their lifetime. For other drugs, the percentages vary and gradually get smaller. For example, only a small number have used heroin in their lifetime. But note that a much larger fraction of people, almost 14%, have used prescription pain killers, which are the same. They're opiates. Now what about the costs of drug use? I think they're far greater than most people would imagine. The estimated economic cost to society due to illegal drugs is over a $180 billion a year, alcohol's about the same, and it's about the same or a little higher for tobacco. So the total for 2004 was 559 billion, which is an astounding number. It's closing in on a trillion dollars. And that's only in the United States. That amount of money could create thousands and thousands of jobs. These figures are the health costs of drug use. They comprise the loss of productivity, legal costs, and other kinds of expenses. But the dollar amounts that we've just talked about do not include any measure of the misery caused by drugs. We don't have an exact metric to measure misery, but we know what happens. We all know stories about people who have had their lives nearly destroyed by drugs. Just being emotionally defeated by powerful drug urges, or anything for that matter, undermines our confidence, our outlook and performance. Some people lose careers, loved ones, friends, and personal and financial resources. Some people lose all their savings. Some people wind up in divorce court. And also, there's a dramatic and significant loss of health due to the side effects and toxicities of drugs. When health is neglected, such as when addicts are preoccupied with finding and taking drugs, problems occur. There are some dramatic before and after photos of individuals who abuse methamphetamines, which you can find by doing a search online. Some drugs cause a big change in your life with terrible consequences for your health. We can also look at the brain and the changes that occur after chronic drug use. Consider the prefrontal cortex, which is very important for our functioning. It's believed to enhance activity that we need to reach goals and to inhibit irrelevant activities. It's involved in emotional regulation. This bar graph shows the volume of the prefrontal cortex, which is measured in brain scans. The volume of the healthy prefrontal cortex is shown by the bar on the left. And the volume of the prefrontal cortex in alcoholics is shown in the middle. Note the dramatic reduction in brain volume. The bar on the right is the volume of the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenic patients. And you can see that alcohol ultimately causes toxicity and a reduction in brain volume that is equivalent to what's found in seriously ill mental patients with schizophrenia. Now, there is some question as to whether the brain volume is reduced before people start drinking, but in general, it's accepted that the reduction in brain volume is mainly due to the consequences of drinking alcohol repeatedly over a long period of time. So you can see that there are very significant costs for getting caught in the web of compulsive drug-taking. There's the economic cost, which we can measure in dollars, and there's the cost in misery and health. Overall, it's huge. After this video, please go to one of the websites and see if you can find out how the data we looked at breaks down. For example, what fraction of the cost of drug use is due to the loss of worker productivity? Until next time.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/OH2Ep/the-ten-classes-of-drugs","The Ten Classes of Drugs","This session is an overview of the drugs that we're going to discuss in this course. We'll expand on these in much more detail in later weeks. As I've mentioned in previous lectures there are about ten classes of drugs, or groups of drugs, that we are going to talk about. The first one is alcohol. This is a drug with massive use in our society and worldwide. And it is a major health problem. Another group is tobacco which, of course, contains nicotine. And this also causes major health problems worldwide. Another, caffeine. We don't usually consider it to be a serious addiction problem but it's clearly something that many of us like to take. We do take it and if we don't take it we might get headaches and feel bad. Some say that caffeine is the most widely used psychoactive substance in the world. Psychoactive, meaning it affects our minds. Marijuana, shown here is widely used. And it's another one of these classes of drugs. Inhalants are often solvents found in glue or something like gasoline. They are the cause of major health problems in third world countries and among children in those countries. And another group are the opioids. And because of the importance of these drugs in medicine as painkillers, many, many opioids of various types have been developed. In the last 50-60 years, many anti-anxiety and sedative drugs have been developed. And they are very useful and very important in medicine. But they are also addicting. The next group is the psychostimulant group and it contains drugs like cocaine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine. The hallucinogens include PCP, or phencyclidine and others like LSD. Then there's a catch all group, other, the things that don't quite fit into these other classes, and new things that are probably on the horizon and that are being developed that we will discover to be addicting. So those are the various drugs and groups of drugs that we will be discussing throughout this course. Here we see some of the chemical structures of some of those substances. Structures for ethanol, nicotine, cocaine, and THC, which is the active ingredient or one of the active ingredients in marijuana. THC standing for tetrahydrocannabinol. You can see at a glance that the structures vary greatly. Ethanol is a very small molecule whereas THC is a much larger and far more complex molecule. It's interesting that even though these different molecules have very different shapes. They can all be addicting and abused. And this is something that we will have to try and figure out. Now let's consider the side effects. The reason we're talking about these ten classes of drugs is because they're either addicting or abused to the point where they cause problems in our lives. But another problem with these drugs is that they have toxicities or side effects. And the different drugs have different toxicities and different side effects. If you can't stop taking the drugs, if you take them again and again, then you develop greater and greater toxicity. The toxicity of these drugs will be a major issue that we'll look at in subsequent sessions. These are examples of toxic side effects. Alcohol can cause liver disease. Marijuana decreases mental and physical performance significantly. And I consider withdrawal from drugs a toxic side effect, which it is. Note that withdrawal from alcohol, for example, can be life threatening. It can cause seizures and other serious problems. So not only is the addiction due to these substances, a problem, but the public health people has recognized, have recognized that there are various toxicities associated with these substances. And these toxicities contribute significantly to the problem of drug abuse and addiction. Please take a moment to complete the following activity. Please visit the websites that we've talked about and find information about the different drugs that are abused. Perhaps you have a special interest in one of them. It would be useful for you to research one or two and as I said earlier, these sites will be a good source for the most recent information about many aspects of drug use.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/hGlrP/the-historical-evidence","The Historical Evidence","In this session, I'm going to talk about drug use in history. The point is that drugs have been around for a long time. This image shows a wood cut made by the Incas hundreds and hundreds of years ago depicting a priest drinking some form of cocaine. And the drawing at the top suggests that it's a form of communication with the sun god, perhaps a gift from the god. This says that cocaine was not only used, but that it's effects were so unique and powerful, it suggests that an association with the gods. We're told that, at first, only the priestly class used cocaine. But eventually, it's use became more widespread. So cocaine, for example, has been special at times in the past and continues to be. We not only like drugs like cocaine, we find them to be powerful. A quote from one of the books of Bi New Testament reads, do not get drunk on wine. This is an example where reference to abusing wine or alcohol is found in a text that's hundreds and thousands of years old. Now, some drugs and their use go back further, perhaps thousands and thousands of years. Here you see a poppy flower seed pod that has been scratched or cut or scored. And there is milk or what's called latex leaking out of the pod. And opium is found in that latex. This is how it's done. The poppy flower is grown. Seed pods are scored. And the opium is collected. And as I said, opium's been in use since very ancient times. So why am I bringing this up? To point out that drug use is not a passing fad. It's not a simple, temporary fashion that will fade away. The use of drugs, particularly some drugs, has been remarkably persistent and continuing over many, many years. Now, some forms of a drug might be a fad. And, of course, we can't forget that some drugs are new and weren't discovered until recently. So the abuse of these drugs is very recent. But a point that I want to make is that the use of various drugs, actually, often the same drugs, persists. And this is a hint that we as humans are somehow vulnerable to using drugs. We're somehow ready to take them even if in a destructive pattern. What we're going to find out, which I've already alluded to, is that the brain is set up to like drugs. In that sense, the brain is a co-conspirator in drug use and abuse. And abuse and addiction is a brain disorder. A key statement is, because some brain disorders can be treated, and new medicines are always being discovered, drug abuse can and is likely to be treated effectively. As an aside, let me mention that animals also use drugs. Darwin, in a book he wrote in 1871, pointed out that monkeys like spirits or alcohol and even tobacco, nicotine, after they see men use them. They appear to have the same kinds of distress, such as hangovers, and show other expressions of distress after abusing the drugs. To summarize, this long-standing use of drugs and the persistence of drug use tells us something about our vulnerability. And given that animals probably have the same vulnerabilities, it isn't surprising that we have them also.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/f0t3R/definitions-and-terminology","Definitions and Terminology","In this lecture, I'm going to discuss what I'll be talking about for the rest of the week. One of the topics that I'll touch upon is the history of drug abuse and addiction. And this is particularly illuminating because it implies something about our brains and our culture. You'll see what I mean. Drug abuse has been around for a long time, and that suggests something about our native inborn vulnerability to using drugs. Another topic is how serious the drug abuse problem is. We all know it's serious, but I'll be going into some of the details that describe not only the financial cost, but also the misery this problem produces. I'll talk about the various individual drugs that fall into about ten classes or groups. And it's interesting that some of the drugs in these different groups have actions that are quite different from drugs in the others, yet they all produce addiction. What a fascinating and amazing thing to consider and figure out. Now, let's go into further detail about the definition of drug abuse and addiction. As I mentioned earlier, drug abuse or addiction is seeking and taking drugs in spite of personal distress and harmful consequences. The word addiction denotes a more serious and harmful state than the word abuse. I'll often use them interchangeably, except when I need to emphasize the difference. Another phrase that you may hear is drug dependence. This is associated with a state of physiologic need such that physiologic signs occur when you stop taking the drug. An example is the depression that occurs when an addict stops taking cocaine or the diarrhea that happens when an opiate addict stops taking prescription pain killers. I also want to mention the DSM-5, which is the latest official manual for professionals who deal with and diagnose drug use and drug disorders. The DSM-5 is the fifth edition of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders which is published by the American Psychiatric Association. An interesting thing is that this manual does not use the word addiction or dependence, but rather it refers to problematic use of drugs as a substance use disorder or as a substance-induced disorder. These are interesting changes that avoid using the word addict or dependence, which can be stigmatizing. Being labeled an addict, in any circumstance, can prejudice people against you. A substance use disorder, just as we described for abuse and addiction, is a continued use of the drug in spite of problems. The problems can include impairment, risks to your health, and brain changes. On the other hand, substance-induced disorder refers to things caused by the drugs, and these would include intoxication, withdrawal, or other toxic side effects. Note that other behaviours, besides drug use, are included in the DSM, like gambling disorder. With additional scientific studies, other behaviors may be referred to as addictions or addictive-like states and may be included in future editions of the DSM. Now for something important. We have been describing addiction and abuse in terms of the behavior, which is something you do in spite of harmful consequences. But now I want to shift the focus slightly to talk about a brain-based description of drug abuse and addiction. Because the brain is the organ of behavior and drug addiction is a disorder of problematic behavior, then drug abuse or addiction is a brain disorder. As we look at the brains of people who use drugs, we find that drug use is characterized by changes in the chemistry and anatomy of the brain. And some of these changes are dramatic. It's clear that these changes in chemistry and anatomy underlie and are the cause of addictive behavior. A powerful idea is that if we could reverse some of these chemical changes or anatomical changes, then it seems likely that you would have a way to treat, and maybe even cure, drug users of their addictions. The way these changes occur in the brain is by drugs acting at specific molecular sites that re, we refer to as receptors. Different drugs have different molecular sites, and we'll get into that in more detail. The important issue here, right now, is that we can talk about drug abuse and addiction from the perspective of the brain and the physiology of the brain, in addition to the perspective of behavior. This is an important shift in emphasis that will have many benefits and create a view of addiction that will be helpful to us. As we conclude this lecture, I want you to take some time to explore and answer the following questions. When thinking about drug abuse and addiction as a behavior, what are the key behaviors that define this disorder? Next, which bodily organ controls our behavior and, therefore, contains the basic explanations of abuse and addiction? And finally, as you see in this week's discussion question, we want to learn how to find things at various websites. These websites are just loaded with wonderful materials on this topic. So, as an exercise, please visit the National Institute on Drug Abuse and browse this website. You can start by finding the definition of addiction, and then you can pursue various other things that you may be interested in.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/95VPe/2-5-airborne-precautions","2.5 Airborne Precautions","Airborne transmission occurs when a person infected with a harmful germ like TB, cough, sneezes, laughs, and generates very small germ containing particles called infectious droplet nuclei. Because these droplet nuclei are very small, they do not settle out of the air and stay suspended in the air for a very long time, and can travel long distances away from the source on air currents. If a susceptible person inhales these small droplet nuclei, they can become infected. Airborne precautions are used in addition to standard precautions, when a resident is infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis, the germ that causes TB, and chicken pox or shingles. And residents with disseminated disease or localised disease in an immune compromised resident. All of these diseases are spread by the airborne route and require standard precautions plus additional airborne precautions. Infected residents should be placed in a single room with directly exhausted air and greater than 12 air exchanges per hour, also called an airborne infectious isolation room. The door to this room must remain closed at all times, except for entry and exit of staff. All health care providers and visitors should wear a fit tested n95 mask, when entering the room. All therapy and meals should occur inside the resident's room. Many nursing homes do not have these rooms available. If this is the case, the resident should be transferred to a facility that can manage and provide care for the resident until the condition resolves. In nursing home residence, there are three diseases that require airborne isolation precautions. TB, chicken pox and some patients with shingles. Most nursing homes do not have the facilities to care for residents with TB disease. The residents should be transferred to an acute care facility, capable of managing and evaluating the resident. While awaiting transfer, the resident should be placed in a private room with a portable hepa filtration unit placed near the door. If a hepa filtration unit is not available, a fan can be placed in the window facing toward the outside to ventilate the room. The door should remain closed and staff should wear n95 masks while providing care until the resident is transferred. Chicken pox and shingles are both caused by the varicella zoster virus, and managed similarly. The chart shown here, describes the appropriate management of residents with chicken pox or shingles. For residents with localized shingles, standard precautions are sufficient as long as the lesions remain covered. For residents with disseminated shingles or immune compromised residents with localized shingles, contact precautions with a private room with either negative or neutral pressure should be used. And all healthcare providers and visitors should wear gowns, gloves, and surgical masks upon entry to the room. These precautions should remain in place until the lesions crust over. If a resident is diagnosed with primary chicken pox, the resident must be placed in a private room with negative or neutral pressure, and contact precautions. All health care providers and visitors should wear gowns, gloves, and surgical masks upon entry to the room. These precautions should remain in place until lesions crust over. Pregnant health care providers or visitors who are not immune, should not enter the room of a resident with shingles or chickenpox, due to the risk of harm to the baby should the pregnant individual become infected. Residents with localized lesions, should make sure that all lesions are covered, perform hand hygiene frequently, and avoid scratching lesions. Residents with chicken pox or disseminated shingles should stay in their room, unless it is medically necessary to leave the room, avoid scratching the lesions, and perform hand hygiene frequently. Residents with TB, should stay in their room unless it is medically necessary to leave the room and take all TB treatment medications as prescribed. In this module, you have learned that there are some infections and diseases that cannot be managed with standard precautions alone. In those instances, additional precautions called isolation or transmission based precautions are required. The chart shown here summarizes requirements for the three transmission based precautions for airborne, droplet, and contact spread diseases and infections. Take a moment to review the chart.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/yEq22/2-4-droplet-precautions","2.4 Droplet Precautions","Let's take a moment to review droplet transmission. Droplet transmission occurs when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or laughs and generates droplets that contain the germ that is causing their infection. These droplets are either directly deposited on another person or onto a surface where the droplets are touched or contacted by another person. Droplets are large and travel less than 6 feet from the source before settling out of the air. Because they are large, droplets don't stay in the air for very long. Droplet precautions are used when a resident is infected with a germ like the flu. All standard precautions are observed in addition to placing the resident in a private room and asking all visitors and health care personnel who enter the room to wear a surgical mask. The mask should be removed before leaving. And hand hygiene should be performed. There are many germs that require the use of droplet precautions. This list shows droplet spread germs that are found more often in the nursing home environment. Also shown is the duration of precautions for each germ listed. An additional way to control droplet spread germs is to have infected visitors, residents, and healthcare providers observe respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette. Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette includes coughing or sneezing into your elbow, sleeve or tissue, followed by hand hygiene with soap and water, or an alchohol-based hand rub. Tissues should be disposed of in an appropriate foot operated receptacle. The residents who are placed on droplet precautions, should stay in their room unless it is medically necessary. If the resident is leaving the room, they should be asked to wear a mask during transport. But should not be asked to continuously wear the mask while in their room. Residents should also be educated about respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette and reminded to wash their hands appropriately. They should also remind their visitors about the need to wear a mask while visiting in the room. >> Previously, on Gowns and Gloves, Vanessa becomes curious about Dimitri's obvious preference of Nurse Priscilla. Meanwhile, Mrs. Houston goes from standard precautions to contact precautions for her MRSA infection. Is she worried about her health, or is she more concerned about meeting the granddaughter kept hidden from her since birth? Find out on Gowns and Gloves. >> Elaine, you must calm down. Your stress level is so high, I'm beginning to worry. >> Well dear, I am worried. We had the perfect plan, to fake getting sick so that I could find my long lost granddaughter. Then I had MRSA colonization, then infection, and now I've contracted the flu. >> I know, I know, but it is worth it, we're getting so close. >> Good morning, Mrs. Houston. >> Please, call me Elaine. I'm so sorry about getting into such an uproar yesterday. But all this MRSA talk is hard to digest. Don't worry about it. I'm so sorry to hear that you now have the flu. Because of that though, I need to spend a few minutes with you discussing droplet precautions. >> You mean, there's another sign on my door? >> I'm afraid so, but let's get you well so we can get it down as soon as possible. >> Okay. Let's have it. >> Let's cut right there. I need an explanation on this. A mask for the flu, really? Who's writing this stuff anyway? >> Actually, masks are an important part of stopping the spread of germs that are transmitted when coughing or sneezing. We use droplet precautions, if you refer to this right here. We use droplet precautions to prevent the spread of bad bugs like the flu. These infections are passed from one person to another through close respiratory or mucous membrane contact with respiratory secretions. In other words you cough out or sneeze out tiny drops of water and they contain the germs. Now these droplets float around in the air, somebody breathes them in and whamo, another infection. Now it's preferred to have a single patient room and we've got that covered here. The biggest difference for Demetri is that he will need to wear a mask when he enters the room, for any close contact with Mrs. Houston. That will prevent him from breathing in those tiny contaminated droplets of water. >> Right, okay, I'll buy it, and, action. >> When you leave your room, you'll need to wear a mask like this one. >> A mask? Well I'm already too warm. A mask will make me all sweaty and uncomfortable. It'll make my makeup run. Plus, everyone will know that I have an infection. Oh, how embarrassing. >> One day at a time Mrs. Huston. >> Please, Elaine. >> Okay, Elaine, and you won't need to wear a mask right away, because it's gonna be a while before you feel well enough to leave the room. And it's important for you to practice good respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette. And when you cough, you wanna make sure you direct your cough or sneeze away from people and into your arm or a tissue like this. [COUGH] And you always wanna make sure you wash your hands afterwards. >> Okay there, now run away so I can get some rest. [MUSIC] >> Okay guys, let's setup for the big finale. We have to find out what's going to happen to Mrs. Houston now that she's on droplet precautions. Oop, don't forget your house coat, darling. >> Thank you, dear. >> Here you go. >> Do I really have to wear this silly thing? >> Yes Elaine you do, you don't want anyone else to get that nasty flu bug now though you? Of course not. >> I never noticed what beautiful blue eyes you have. The mask really highlights them. >> Thank you dear. >> Well in fact, your eyes look just like, [MUSIC] >> [LAUGH] Come along darling, we have a lot to do.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/1v79B/2-3-contact-precautions","2.3 Contact Precautions","Let's take a moment to review contact transmission. In this illustration we're going to see how a germ moves from an infected or colonized resident to another resident by health care provider hands. Here we see that the resident and his surroundings are contaminated with a germ. Represented by the purple dots. As you learned in module one, with colonized or infected residents germs contaminate the residents skin, clothes and the nearby environment. Once a health care provider has contact with the resident or surfaces near the resident, they can pick up the germs on their hands. If they fail to perform hand hygiene, or do hand hygiene inadequately, they can transmit the germ to another resident. This is contact transmission. Contact precautions are used when a resident has an infection with a germ, like norovirus or C difficile. Contact precautions are used in addition to standard precautions and require healthcare personnel to one, put on a gown and gloves before entering the room. Two, remove gowns and gloves prior to leaving the room, and performing hand hygiene. And three, dedicate resident care equipment, like stethoscopes. In addition, there may be restrictions on movement and participation in activities. For C difficile and norovirus use contact precautions and remember to perform hand hygiene with soap and water, because alcohol-based hand rubs are not effective against these harmful germs. There are many germs that require residents to be placed on contact precautions. This table describes some of the more commonly encountered germs that require contact precautions, and the duration of contact precautions associated with each germ. This is not a complete list of pathogens, so it is important that you review the entire list of germs that require contact precautions. Norovirus is highly contagious, and often spreads quickly in nursing home settings. If you have residents or a group of residents with norovirus-like symptoms, they should be placed on contact precautions, ideally in a private room, and restricted to their rooms. All staff and visitors should wear a gown and gloves upon entry and should perform hand hygiene with soap and water only for at least fifteen seconds before and after contact with the resident and the resident's environment. It is also important that all environmental surfaces are cleaned using a bleach based disinfectant. The ideal concentration is a one to ten dilution. It may be necessary during an outbreak to disinfect surfaces up to three times a day. Additionally, all health care providers with symptoms such as vomiting or diarrhea should be excluded from work until 48 hours after the last symptom. Residents who are placed on contact precautions also play a role in controlling the spread of germs. They should be educated about why they are on contact precautions and the expectations that are required of them. Residents with a disease that is spread by contact may be asked to stay in their room, wash their hands frequently, especially before leaving the room, prior to participating in activities or therapy, before eating, and after using the bathroom. And keep personal items, like razors and towels, to themselves and not share them with other residents. >> Previously on Gowns and Gloves. It seems as though a lesson in patience is par for the course, as Mrs. Houston begrudgingly learns good hand hygiene. But while she's washing her hands It's Dimitri who seems to have something up his sleeve. Will the Houstons get Priscilla back as their nurse? Find out on Gowns and Gloves. [MUSIC] >> Priscilla would you mind helping me get Mrs. Houston up so I can change her sheets? >> Well I was just about to go on break. >> Come on, there will be time for break later. [MUSIC] >> All right. >> Cut. I'm gonna need the content expert in here. Now, if she's infected with MRSA, we can't have the nurses go into Ms. Houston's room in this scene. >> No, Jacque. You remember from the last episode, Mrs. Houston is only colonized with MRSA in her nose and on her body, so contact precautions aren't necessary. The nurses only need to use standard precautions, which mean they will wash their hands or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, wearing gloves and bagging the sheets and other laundry that they change at her bedside. And you would've known that if you had noticed that there wasn't a sign saying contact precautions on the door. >> Okay. Well what happens if, and when she becomes infected with MRSA? >> Then we will use contact precautions in addition to standard precautions. Contact precautions require that all staff wear gowns and gloves and place a sign like this on the door and making sure that the gloves and the gowns are available at the room entrance. >> Oh yeah, the swimming pool idea. I get it. If she gets infected, then we go to contact precautions. I get it. All right, let's do it again. Everybody ready, set, and action. [MUSIC] >> Mr. Houston. >> Yep. I told you to call me Dimitre. >> Hello, Vanessa. Have you heard the latest? >> No, what's the latest? >> Dr. Kennedy just stopped by and told me, Elaine has an active MRSA infection. >> I'll go get the contact precautions sheets and bring the supplies. Now in addition to hand washing and gloves, we'll need gowns. But first, I should wash my hands. >> Wait, but she hasn't even touched anything yet. [SOUND] >> Residents with infections from MRSA and other antibiotic resistant organisms are more likely to contaminate the environment around. See, every time you touch something it's a chance to spread the MRSA. Hand washing is the single most effective way to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Now the prop guy could put the sign on the door. >> Great, props, and action! [MUSIC] >> Looks like we'll be here longer than I thought. >> I suppose you will be. But Mrs. Houston's health is the most important thing. Mr. Houston, I mean Dimitre.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/cycdH/2-2-review-of-standard-precautions","2.2 Review of Standard Precautions","Thousands of people die everyday from infections acquired while receiving healthcare. As we've already stated, hands are the main pathway of germ transmission in healthcare. Hand hygiene is the number one most important measure to stop the transmission of harmful germs and to prevent healthcare associated infections. Shown here are the five moments for hand hygiene, developed by the World Health Organization. Let's take a minute to look at each moment in more detail. The first moment for hand hygiene occurs when you enter the resident zone and before touching the resident. Performing hand hygiene here protects the resident against colonization, and in some cases, against infections by harmful germs carried by your hands. An example of a situation where this would be appropriate is before assisting a resident with personal care activities. The second moment for hand hygiene occurs before you perform any clean or aseptic procedure. This is done to protect the resident against infection with bad bugs, including their own germs, entering his or her body. An example of a situation where this would apply would be before preparing food, medications, injections, or dressing a wound. The third moment occurs anytime there is a body fluid exposure risk. Performing hand hygiene here protects you from colonization or infection with the resident's harmful germs and protects the healthcare environment from the spread of germs. A good example of this would be after cleaning an incontinent resident, emptying a urinary catheter bag, changing soil bed linen, or checking a blood sugar. The fourth moment happens after you have touched the resident. Hand hygiene at this moment protects you from colonization and infection and protects the healthcare environment from the spread of germs. A good example for this opportunity would be after performing a physical exam or assisting a resident with personal care needs. The fifth moment for hand hygiene occurs anytime you touch the resident's surroundings. This protects you from colonization and infection with resident germs that may be present on surfaces or objects in the resident's surroundings and protects the healthcare environment against germ spread. A good example of this would be after any activity involving physical contact with the resident's immediate environment. Like changing bed linens, holding a bed rail, clearing a bedside table, or even leaning against the bed. It is important that you take every opportunity to perform hand hygiene to keep the residents, yourself, and the environment free from germs. You should always use an alcohol based handrub for hand hygiene unless your hands are visibly soiled. To effectively reduce the growth of germs on hands, you should have enough product in your hands to wet all surfaces of your hands for at least 20 to 30 seconds. You should wash your hands with anti-bacterial soap and water when they are visibly soiled or after caring for resident with diarrhea. Otherwise, use an alcohol based handrub. You should wash your hands for a minimum 15 seconds with soap and water. You should follow the steps described here to effectively wash your hands. Standard precautions are a corner stone of infection control. They're based on the assumption that all moist body fluids from all residents are colonized or infected with one or more bad bugs. The general rule of thumb is that if it is warm, wet, and not yours, standard precautions apply. We have already reviewed hand hygiene, the first element of standard precautions. We will review some of the elements of standard precautions that are important for preventing the spread of bad bugs. Gowns, gloves, and mask are also an important aspect of standard precautions and further prevent the spread of bad bugs when they are utilized appropriately. They are intended to protect the user from contamination and should always be used when there is potential for contact with blood or potentially contaminated body fluids, such as urine or stool. Hand hygiene should always be performed before putting on personal protective equipment, or PPE, and following removal. Gloves should be worn anytime there is anticipated contact with blood or other potentially infectious material. Gloves should be changed during resident care if the hands move from a dirty body site, like the groin, to a clean body site, like the face. The same pair of gloves should not be used for more than one patient and should never be washed and reused. Hands should be washed after glove removal. Gowns are used to protect the user's clothes and bare skin from contamination that could occur during resident care. Like with gloves, gowns should be worn when there is the potential for contamination of the skin or clothes during resident care. Gowns should not be reused, or used for multiple residents, even those in the same room. Mask and eye protection should be worn when there is potential for splash, or spray of blood, respiratory secretions or other body fluids. Masks should be changed if they become wet and discarded after care of the resident. You may be able to disinfect and reuse eye protection, depending on the manufacturer. Another very important part of controlling the spread of bad bugs is room placement. A private room is preferred for residents who are colonized or infected with a bad bug. If a private room is not available, the next best option is to place the colonized or infected resident into a room with another resident with the same type of bad bug meaning MRSA positive resident rooms with an MRSA positive resident or VRE with VRE. Residents with two different bad bugs should never be put in the same room together. The third option is to place a resident with a bad bug in a room with the healthiest resident possible because the healthiest resident has the lowest risk for getting the bad bug. A clean resident care environment is as important as hand hygiene in preventing the transmission of bad bugs in nursing homes. We already know that residents with bad bugs such as MRSA and VRE, have the bacteria present on all or parts of their skin. These bacteria shed on to environmental surfaces, such as bed rails and tabletops and the resident's immediate environment. These organisms can survive on dry environmental surfaces from several hours to many weeks and serve as a source of hand, glove, and clothing contamination. All surfaces and equipment should be cleaned with an EPA registered surface disinfectant. Daily cleaning of surfaces within the resident's immediate environment, shared resident care equipment, and common areas lowers the level of contamination, and the risk of cross transmission is reduced. Similarly thoroughly cleaning a room after a resident is discharged protects the next resident who will be occupying the room from potentially getting a bad bug. Soiled linens such as sheets, towels and continents pads and patient gowns are contaminated with bad bugs even if visible soil is not evident. All linen should be handled with care and as little agitation as possible to avoid contamination of the air, surfaces, and people in the immediate area. Linen should be placed immediately into a leak resistant container and should not be sorted or placed on any surface prior to containment. Just as it is important for staff to maintain their hygiene, it is also very important that residents are able to maintain their hygiene. This includes bathing residents regularly, ensuring that incontinence care is done appropriately and thoroughly and residents wash their hands frequently, including before and after eating, before and after group activities, and after using the bathroom.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/N5QJM/2-1-the-chain-of-infection","2.1 The chain of infection","Hi and welcome to Module 2: Isolation Precautions. As you learned in Module 1, standard precautions are the foundation for preventing the spread of germs like bacteria, fungi and viruses. Many of these germs spread even with the use of standard precautions and the addition of isolation precautions or transmission based precautions is required, based on how harmful these germs are and how they spread. In this module, we will review standard precautions and describe the three isolation precaution categories. Contact precautions, d1roplet precautions, and airborne precautions. We use the word transmission when talking about the spread of germs. The learning objectives for this module are, to review and understand standard precautions. To understand contact, droplet, and airborne precautions. To understand when to implement contact, droplet, and airborne precautions, and to understand the role of the resident in contact, droplet and airborne precautions. To fully understand how to control the spread of germs, it is important to know how infections are spread from one person to another through the chain of infection. There are six links in the Chain of Infection. The infectious agent or germ. A reservoir where the germ normally lives. A portal of exit from the infected person. A means of transmission between persons. A portal of entry in a susceptible person. And a susceptible person. The infectious agent is any harmful germ that causes disease. In module one, you learned about antibiotic-resistant bacteria, like MRSA, but there are other harmful germs that also cause infection. There are viruses like flue and norovirus, fungi like candida, parasites like giardia or arthropods like scabies or mites. All of these can cause illness and infections in nursing homes. Reservoirs are places where germs hang out, grow and increase in numbers. These can be a person, animal, or environmental surface, like a bed rail or BP cuff. In people, germs can hang out on people's skin. In the digestive tract like the mouth, stomach or intestines, and in the respiratory tract like the nose or throat. In order for a germ to spread from one person to another it has to have a way to get out of the reservoir. Some of the most common ways to get out are through the skin, nose and anus, but there are numerous ways for a germ to escape. Look at the diagram to see some of these exit points. Once a germ leaves the body, it has to have a way to spread. There are three main types of spreading or transmission. Contact spread, droplet spread, and airborne spread. Diseases spread by contact, or touching, like MRSA are spread through physical contact with the infected person, called direct contact. Or through physical contact with a contaminated surface or device such as a towel or BP cuff, called indirect contact. Droplet-spread diseases, like flu, are spread through infected droplets that are generated when a person coughs, sneezes, laughs, or talks. The infected droplets can either have direct contact with another person, like coughing in someone's face. Or through indirect contact, when the droplets settle on a surface that is touched or contacted by another person. Droplets generally travel less than six feet and do not stay in the air for very long because they are heavy. Airborne spread diseases like tuberculosis are spread through very small infected droplets called aerosols or droplet nuclei. These very small droplets can stay suspended in the air for a very long time and can be breathed in by another person. They can be transmitted over long distances such as an entire common room like a cafeteria. Another thing that has to be present for a germ to infect another person is a way for the germ to enter the body of the new person. The most common portals, or places of entry, are respiratory tract, nose or mouth, gastrointestinal tract, mouth, urinary tract and breaks in the skin. Take a moment to look at the diagram to see additional portals of entry for germs. The final link in the chain of infection is that the person being infected must be vulnerable or susceptible to the infectious agent. Some of the factors that affect the susceptibility of the person or host are, being very young or older, high stress, being fatigued or worn out, having poor nutrition, having other diseases and illnesses. Such as diabetes, obesity, renal disease or lung disease. Not being vaccinated and having breaks in the skin. Certain medications like chemotherapy can make a person more likely to become infected. Now that we know how infections are spread, let's look at how we can break the chain of infection and stop the spread of infection. >> Previously on gowns and gloves, Nurse Priscilla breaks the news to Mr. Houston that his wife has been exposed and colonized with MRSA. Will Elaine become infected with MRSA, and what's going on between Dimitri and Priscilla? Find out on Gowns and Gloves. >> And I have something really cool. >> Hi, I'm Vanessa, Prucilla's with another resident. >> Oh. >> She asked me to come in and talk to Mrs. Houston about the precautions that we'll be taking to help control the spread of MRSA here at Sunnyside. You're currently on standard precautions, which is what we use for everyone here at the facility. >> Well, we noticed when we were moved down here a lot of people had carts outside their rooms and signs on their doors. >> Yes, those residents have been placed under contact precautions. We use contact precautions for residents with infections from bacteria like MRSA to help control the spread between residents. I can't tell you about their specifics, but that is what those signs and carts indicate. >> I don't understand this scene it all. Why don't I have one of those signs or carts outside my room? At the moment your character is colonized which means you have the MRSA bacteria on your skin and in your nose. You don't have an active infection like some of the other residents. That's why is not necessary right now for you to be put on contact precautions and put a sign on the door. See the main thing is that the staff wear gloves, practice good hand hygiene and never share personal items between residents. >> So what do I do now that I'm colonized? >> Well Vanessa will be relaying all of the information for what your character is to do. Again the main thing is to practice good hand hygiene. Wash with soap and water, antiseptic soap and water, or an FDA approved alcohol based hand gel. >> Great. [LAUGH] Good hand hygiene, I get that. Now, we ready? Action. >> Mrs.Houston since you're on standard precaution, all staff will need to wear gloves when providing care for you and wash their hands before and after caring for you. If you see and we're not washing our hands or using an alcohol based hand gel, you need to remind us. You two both of you need to make sure that you wash your hands before leaving the room and after you return to it. >> This is painful. I feel as though I'm being punished. And what happens if i want to have visitors or leave the room? Well right now there is no restriction on your movement throughout the facility. Just make sure you wash your hands before you leave the room and before you participate in any activity. The same rules apply to you too, Mr. Houston. Is there anything else I can help you out with? >> No >> I just wish Priscilla were here. >> Elaine that is so rude. >> But I still feel that I'm being punished, I'm being penalized for something that I am not responsible for. Please leave. >> Mrs.Hughes >> I said, get out. [MUSIC] I can't be isolated at the end of this hall. It ruins our plan. >> Not so fast, darling. We could use this to our advantage. [MUSIC] Yes, it's me. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/5IsIz/3-3-safe-diabetes-care","3.3 Safe Diabetes Care","Another means of spreading blood borne pathogens is through unsafe diabetes care. This under appreciated area of risk has been the mode of transmission for many hepatitis B outbreaks. As mentioned earlier, there have been twenty three hepatitis B virus outbreaks associated with the assisted monitoring of blood glucose. These accounted for 92 percent of all hepatitis B virus outbreaks in long term care facilities. The outbreaks have been linked to the infection control breaches shown here. Including sharing of blood glucose meters without disinfection and cleaning between uses, use of finger stick devices or insulin pens for multiple people, and failure to perform hand hygiene or change gloves between procedures. Sharing glucometers without proper disinfection is the most common breech. If all health care providers know and practice these three simple rules for safe injections and safe diabetes care, the knowledge gap that contributes to outbreaks will be significantly reduced. If new knowledge is applied to implement safe practices, great strides could be made in preventing devastating out breaks. We can do this by designating someone to provide ongoing oversight, developing written infection control policies, providing training, conducting quality assurance assessments, and lastly speak up with if you see someone not following safe injection practices. You are not only protecting your patients, you are protecting your colleagues as well. The One and Only Campaign led by the CDC and the Safe Injection Practices Coalition was launched in September of 2009 in response to the increasing number of outbreaks relating to unsafe injections. In an attempt to prevent these unsafe injection practices, the campaign established the goal to ensure that patients are protected each and every time they receive a medical injection. The One and Only Campaign aims to do this by increasing understanding and implementation of safe injection practices among health care providers and to empower patients to ask their health care providers about their injection practices. The free resources that they have developed educate both health care providers and patients. Go to oneandonlycampaign.org for more information. [MUSIC] Rejects. >> Show me the technique. >> Contestants from around the country. [MUSIC] One great prize. This season on The Technique. >> [MUSIC] >> [APPLAUSE] >> Hi guys, I'm Rob Marino and welcome back for the second round of The Technique. It's been rough for a few contestants. But we've got some definite front runners in David, Jennifer, and Sara. Tonight, we'll be focusing on safe blood glucose monitoring, and insulin administration. [MUSIC] >> [APPLAUSE] All of the contestants that made it through really showed their chops last week. And tonight we are observing their technique in providing safe blood glucose monitoring and insulin administration. And I tell you, I can't wait. >> Jean, for all the folks at home, can you remind us what the judges will be looking for in this round? >> Sure, Rob. The CDC wants all health care providers to know these simple rules for anyone who performs or assists with blood glucose monitoring and insulin administration. There are two types of fingerstick devices, those that are designed for reuse on a single person, and those that are for single use and disposable. The simple rule is fingerstick devices should never be used for more than one person. Now these are devices that measure blood glucose levels. Whenever possible, these meters should be assigned to an individual person and not shared. Now if they are shared, they must be cleaned and disinfected between each use, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Insulin can be administered using an insulin pen designed for reuse on a single person. It can also be administered using a needle and syringe, after drawing it up from an insulin vial. The simple rule here is, injection equipment like insulin pens, needles, and syringes, should never be used for more than one person. Just like with safe injection practices it is always important that we see these folks perform hand hygiene before putting on gloves and providing care and again after removing gloves in between residents. It is also important that they maintain the equipment in a clean way so that blood contamination does not occur. >> Great Jean. Thanks for the recap. Our contestants sure have a difficult test coming up. Our first contestant is Sarah. Before we let her show her technique tonight, let's recap her performance from round one last week that put her through to the second round. >> Impeccable performance. [MUSIC] Absolutely flawless. >> A real challenger for the trophy. >> On the heels of that impeccable performance, it's Sarah. >> [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC] >> Sarah's starting off strong again. Great hand hygiene and glove use. [MUSIC] Hmm. Interesting choice, she picked up the reusable lancing device to pierce the resident's finger. [MUSIC] Looks like she's finished with the first resident and is moving on to the next one. [MUSIC] But wait, she didn't clean the glucose meter and is planning to reuse the lancing device on the next resident, that is not good. [MUSIC] >> Rob, I've seen enough, stop. Stop. [SOUND] You have just committed two serious errors here. By not disinfecting the glucose meter with an EPA approved disinfectant, and you were about to use the same lancet device on the next resident. You certainly fallen from the pedestal we put you on. >> I really had high hopes for you. But clearly you need some practice on your technique. >> I'm sorry Sarah. You do not have, the technique. >> Those are the highs and lows of this competition, you've got to bring your A game everyday if you wanna make it through to final judgement. >> [APPLAUSE] >> That brings us to our next contestant Jennifer, you all remember her, she barely made it out of the first round with a split decision from the judges, let's see if she can change her fortune tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Jennifer. >> [APPLAUSE] >> I tell you good aseptic technique again. See how smoothly her gloves go on. >> Much better than some of the earlier ones today. >> Awesome. [MUSIC] >> Looks like the judges really want to test Jennifer today after her last performance. They've given her an insulin pen. This will require real attention to detail. [MUSIC] >> Really moving through these steps. [MUSIC] Using two talents at once, that's brilliant. [MUSIC] >> She's doing a great job Selecting a single use lancet. [MUSIC] >> Very nicely done there. [MUSIC] She's checking the blood sugar. [MUSIC] This is so nice to watch when it's done right. [MUSIC] She's properly disposing of the lancet, in a puncture proof container I might add. And disinfecting the meter. [MUSIC] Now she's getting ready to inject the resident. [MUSIC] >> Very nice. >> Mm-hm. [MUSIC] >> Great job. >> Mm-hm. Feel it. Feel it. >> [MUSIC] >> Okay, here she goes. [MUSIC] Love. And the resident didn't even move. >> Huh-uh. Did not. >> When it's done right, it's wonderful. >> It's like music. [MUSIC] >> Oh this is beautiful. >> Yes we could have charged admission. [LAUGH] [MUSIC] >> Yes. Great job. She recognized the insulin pen and correctly labeled it with the residence name. And she obviously knew that the insulin pen cannot be shared between residents, beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Great job. >> So strong. >> I have no words but excellent. >> So very strong. Oh, right here. >> I am so very happy that you've recovered from last week. Can you tell me why you chose to label the insulin pen? >> Sure. I always think, be aware, don't share. Just like with other injection equipment, insulin pens are meant for use on a single person only and should never be used for more than one person even if the needle is changed. Insulin pens should be clearly labeled with the residents name or other identifying information to ensure that the correct pen is used on the correct person. >> Jennifer, brilliant performance. You're moving on to final judgement. >> [APPLAUSE] >> [MUSIC] [APPLAUSE] >> Great job, Jennifer. Well, we're down to one final contestant before final judgement. >> [APPLAUSE] >> Last week, David demonstrated tremendous skill with his ability to perform safe injections. Can he keep the momentum going? Will he be able to make final judgement? David, take it away. >> [APPLAUSE] >> Interesting, David is beginning by cleaning the glucose meter. [MUSIC] >> And now he is washing his hands. [MUSIC] >> Great job. >> And putting on a clean pair of gloves. A solid start. [MUSIC] >> Wow. I like the fact that he's using the single-use finger sticks. It's good stuff. [MUSIC] >> Alright, he's done with the first resident. He's disinfecting glucose meter, again. He's removed his gloves and is performing hand hygiene. >> David, please you can stop right there, thank you. >> Boy, you look good tonight. >> Minerva [LAUGH] >> I mean his performance. [APPLAUSE] >> David I really like the fact that you took the time to disinfect the meter before you started, can you tell me why you did that? >> Oh, I wasn't the last person to use the meter so I can't be certain that it was clean before now. I cleaned it because the meter may be contaminated with blood, even if it is invisible to the eye, and I don't want a resident to get hepatitis or some other germ. >> Since you seem to have a firm grasp on this. >> Firm, so firm. >> What would be the best practice for facilities regarding glucose meters. Well, my facility back home assigns each resident their own meter to use while they're residents there. I think that's the best practice since it reduces the chance of a meter being shared. Now, if a facility can't assign each resident a meter, it needs to be cleaned between each resident with a compatible EPA-approved hospital disinfectant with a TB or HIV, hepatitis B kill claim, with a one to ten Deluded Bleach solution. Or according to manufacturer's recommendations. >> Okay, great. I have heard enough. In fact, I need you to stop talking cuz I'm afraid you're gonna take my job [LAUGH] But let's just say you are on to final judgment, David. [MUSIC] >> All right we're down to our final contestants. Jennifer from Charleston and David from Chapel Hill. It's the battle of north versus south Carolina. It's time for the judges to decide who the McKnight trophy winner is and who goes home empty handed. Let's tune in to the judges' deliberation. >> That David is really something special. Maybe his expert knowledge and a really great technique. >> Minerva, you bring up some valid points but I believe your obvious crush is getting on the way of your unbiased judgement. Jennifer, she had a really strong performance. No, make that impeccable. So I'm torn here. >> You know no doubt they both performed well, but honestly I cannot overlook Jennifer's labeling error last round. Sorry. [MUSIC] >> Rob, I think we're ready to crown the winner here. [MUSIC] >> Jennifer, David, you've both shown safe injection techniques and proper glucometer care are alive and well in both of your nursing homes. And for that, we congratulate your skills and knowledge. But tonight, there can only be one person who truly represents perfection. The one who has the technique. [MUSIC] Jennifer! >> [APPLAUSE] >> You do not have the technique. David is our winner. >> Oh! >> Yes! >> [APPLAUSE] >> David, congratulations. Is there anything you'd like to say to the audience? >> Grandma, this trophy's for you. [APPLAUSE] >> Woo! >> Well, it looks like grandma is about to be the star of her nursing home these days, while David may get the celebrity treatment from Minerva. Tune in next season as we continue to inject our way into your heart. [APPLAUSE] >> Just kidding. I didn't mean to say it that way. Thanks for joining us on The Technique. Have a great night. >> [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/U4f47/3-2-safe-injection-practices","3.2 Safe Injection Practices","Though it seems unimaginable, health care providers have some knowledge gaps surrounding contamination and have reported syringe reuse. Direct syringe reuse, just as it sounds, involves the use of a single syringe for multiple patients. This includes reuse of insulin pens, administering medication through intervening lengths of tubing with the same syringe, or administering vaccines to multiple patients after changing the needle but reusing the syringe. As an example of this in a Colorado pediatric office in 2011 a medical assistant performing vaccinations removed the needle from what she believed was an adult dose and saved the syringe for a second pediatric dose, this also occurred at an obstetrics office in New York in 2008 where the staff put six doses of flu vaccine in a syringe changing only the needle between patients. Direct syringe reuse does happen but the most common cause for these large Hepatitis outbreaks is indirect reuse or double dipping. This happens when a used, contaminated syringe, is used to re-enter a vial or bag that is a common source for multiple patients. As you can imagine, just one entry into a bag with a contaminated syringe can lead to multiple exposures if the medication is used for subsequent patients. Previous outbreaks and notification events have shown that some Dangerous Misperceptions surrounding safe injections exist. As illustrated with the Nevada example, some providers believe that changing the needle makes a syringe safe for reuse. False. Back-flow from the injection can contaminate the syringe. Another Misperception is that syringes can be reused if there is a sufficient length of tubing between the patient and the injection sight. False, everything from the medication bag to the patient's IV catheter is a single interconnected unit. Distance from the patient, gravity, or even infusion pressure do not insure that the syringe will not become contaminated. Lastly, some providers might think that the lack of visible blood means the supplies are safe for reuse. Again, this is false. Pathogens like HIV and Hepatitis B and C can be present in sufficient quantities to cause infection without blood being visible. An easy rule to remember is this, once a needle and syringe are used, both are contaminated and must be discarded. A single dose vile lacks antimicrobial preservatives to prevent bacterial growth, it should be discarded after a single use. Even if there is leftover medication. Intravenous fluids are for single patient use and should not be used for more than one patient. Just like single dose vials these fluids lack antimicrobial preservatives to prevent growth of contaminating bacteria. A multiple-dose vial has antimicrobial preservatives to prevent bacterial growth, and can be used for more than one patient. Multiple-dose vials should be discarded when the beyond-use date is reached, when doses are drawn in patient treatment areas, and when sterility of the vial is in doubt. The size of the vial does not matter. Single dose vials and multiple dose vials come in a variety of sizes. Do not assume a vial is a single dose or multiple dose based on size. Always read the label. As a result of outbreaks resulting from single dose vial misuse, the CDC restated it's position on the use of single dose, single use vials in 2012. The CDC stated that vials labeled by the manufacturer as single dose or single use should only be used for a single patient. Ongoing outbreaks provide ample evidence to support that this misuse results in patient harm. Leftover medication should not be pooled or stored for later administration. And in times of shortage, medications can be repackaged only if it's done in accordance with established standards. Failure to use aseptic technique when preparing medications, is another major cause of outbreaks relating to unsafe injections. In this context, aseptic technique means handling and preparing supplies used for injections in a manner that prevents microbial contamination between the injection materials and the non-sterile environment. Failure to use aseptic technique is most often linked to the spread of Hepatitis B. Hepatitis B is a hardy virus and has has been demonstrated to remain infectious in dried blood on environmental surfaces for at least seven days at a New Jersey oncology office in 2009, failure to use aseptic technique resulted in 29 outbreak associated cases and an additional 68 possible cases and 4,600 patients who were considered potentially exposed and were notified to be tested. As a result, the practice was closed and the physician's license was revoked. The outbreak that lead to so many people becoming infected with Hepatitis B was due to the following infection control breaches, lack of hand hygiene, failure to establish a clean medication area, and the preparation of medications in areas with visible blood contamination. Use of a common use saline bag, and reuse of single dose vials for multiple patients. [MUSIC] >> Three judges. >> Show me the technique. >> Contestants from around the country. One great prize. This season on the technique. [MUSIC] >> [APPLAUSE] >> Hi folks, and welcome back. I'm Rob Moreno and this is the technique. Last night we watched Jennifer from Charleston squeak through the first round after failing to label her multi-use vial. And Kim from Oklahoma had to turn her car back home after a disastrous attempt to use a single dose vial on two residents. What does tonight's continuation of round one have in store for us? [APPLAUSE] >> Hi, I'm David. And I'm from Sunnyside Nursing Home and I'm going to win The Technique. >> [APPLAUSE] >> David, loving the confidence today. What does the audience not know about you going in to these auditions? >> Well Rob, this is my second time competing, I made it to the top two last year but my grandma got sick and I knew that my perfect techniques were needed more at home than on TV. I love you grandma. >> What a touching story and is your grandma watching you on the TV this time around? >> Yep. The Nursing Home that she's in they air the technique in the main lobby for all the residents to cheer me on. They've seen me personally in action. And tonight, they're ready for me to win. >> [APPLAUSE] >> Touching story. Now let's see if David can perform like he promises. >> So, David, you can begin when you're ready. >> His confidence. He sees the multi-dose vial pen labels it at the get go. He knows his 28 day rule. >> Rob, I am loving him already. >> I agree, hand hygiene is looking great. A good amount of time with the hand rubbing. Oh. >> Oh. >> Snafu there. >> Change he got another pair. >> He did. [MUSIC] >> I'm rubbing the rubber septum with alcohol for at least ten seconds prior to drawing up the medication. Now, I'm administering the injection. Now I'm disposing of the injection equipment properly. >> [APPLAUSE] >> And you have no intention of using the multi-use file on another resident, hm? >> Never. >> Well way to go Menerver. Why don't you tell him exactly what to say. >> [LAUGH] >> I have to say I wished he had said that on his own. >> Yes. >> But his technique speaks to his knowledge of not sharing multi-use vials whenever possible. David, can you tell me correct protocol if multi-use vials need to be used on more than one resident? >> Not only can I tell you, I can show you. >> Let's get the camera on this. [SOUND] >> The multi-dose vial should always be stored and accessed in a clean, dedicated area for medication preparation and never in the immediate resident treatment area or a resident room. This is to prevent inadvertent contamination of the vial through direct or indirect contact with potentially contaminated surfaces or equipment that could lead to infections in subsequent residents. Now if a multi-dose vial enters the immediate resident treatment area, it should be dedicated to the resident only or discarded after use. In addition, a new sterile needle and syringe should always be used to access the medication of multi-dose vial because the reuse of needles and syringes to access multi-dose vial medication can result the contamination of the medicine with microbes that can spread to others when the medicine is used again. >> Well, Jean, satisfied there? >> [APPLAUSE] >> David, I think it's safe to say you're on to round two. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC] >> Oh, and one last contestant, a late arrival from New York City. Amber. >> My name is Amber, and I'm from Seabrook Nursing Home in New York City. >> Amber, great. Why don't you begin? >> Mm-hm. >> Great hand hygiene. >> Okay. >> I can't see past her hair. >> Well, it's definitely up out of the way. You know there's something familiar about how she did the gloves, don't you think? >> She reminds me of someone. So far so good. [MUSIC] >> Well at least she's hygienic. [MUSIC] [NOISE] Amber are you missing something? >> I don't think so. >> Amber I'm sorry. But you just left the needle in the vial. That's an immediate fail. And not to mention that it's in a single use vial which is another indication of your inability to practice the technique. >> Wait just a second. This looks like a very sloppy performance that we saw earlier in the day. Is that a wig? >> Is this Kim? >> Are you trying to cheat your way on to a spot on the technique. >> I can't even deal with this. Get off our stage immediately. Rob, what happened to screening the contestants first? >> Join us next week as our contestants hone their skills for round two where the technique will turn its focus to glucometer care. I'm Rob Moreno and this is The Technique. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/L6h6r/3-1-the-big-picture","3.1 The Big Picture","In this module we will examine the unsafe injection practices that have led to large outbreaks of blood borne pathogens. Then we will examine the recommended best practices for safe injections and blood glucose monitoring. Followed by a review of some of the contributing factors that lead to the misuse of injection equipment. The consequences of these outbreaks are devastating. Sometimes resulting in patient illness and deaths. Outbreaks can also result in notifications of many potentially exposed patients. Causing considerable psychological impacts including anxiety for patients and their families, even if no actual transmission has occurred. Outbreaks can also result in loss of licenses, legal charges and malpractice suits, and criminal charges. Additionally, these outbreaks erode confidence in our health care system. These never events are entirely preventable. Health care should never provide any avenue for transmission of blood borne pathogens or micro organisms. The number of outbreaks has grown substantially over the past decade. Since 2001, the CDC has identified 48 outbreaks related to unsafe injection practices during the delivery of injectable medications. Just over 40% of the outbreaks were viral hepatitis infections, and around 60% were bacterial infections, most of which were bloodstream infections. We are seeing more and more outbreaks in outpatient settings with an over-representation in pain management clinics, and oncology clinics. These outbreaks have resulted in hundreds of infections. In addition, to those infected during this period, there have been over 150,000 patients potentially exposed to infection as a result of poor practices. These are patients who received letters or phone calls telling them they should be tested for hepatitis, HIV or other infections because of unsafe practices such as syringe reuse. Outbreaks of Hepatitis B virus infection associated with assisted blood glucose monitoring have been identified with increasing regularity. Particularly in long term care settings, where residents often require assistance with monitoring blood glucose levels and or insulin administration. Since 2001,, there have been 23 recognized outbreaks related to the assisted monitoring of blood glucose. These outbreaks resulted in about 2,000 notifications and over 170 incident infections. Of all virus hepatitis outbreaks in long term care facilities, those associated with the assisted monitoring of blood glucose accounted for about 90%. Although the majority of these outbreaks have been reported in long-term care settings, the risk of infection is present in any setting where blood glucose monitoring equipment is shared. Or those assisting with blood glucose monitoring and or insulin administration failed to follow basic principles of infection control. The big four causes that lead to these outbreaks are syringe reuse, either directly or indirectly, inappropriate use of single-dose or single-use vials, failure to use a septic technique. A septic technique can be defined very broadly and encompasses all of the big four. But in this case, we're referring to contamination of injection equipment from the nonsterile environment. The fourth major cause is unsafe diabetes care. Specifically, the assisted monitoring of blood glucose. Outbreaks often involve more than one of these breaches. [MUSIC] >> 3 judges. >> Show me the technique. >> Contestants from around the country. [MUSIC] One great pride. This seat on The Technique. [MUSIC] [APPLAUSE]. Welcome everyone. I'm Rob Marino and welcome to The Technique. After last season's record shattering finale, we're in for a second stellar season on The Technique, where contestants try to prove they've got the best injection safety and glucometer care skills in their field to earn themselves the coveted McKnight trophy. [MUSIC] >> The McKnight trophy honors Evelyn McKnight Whose personal experience motivated her to bring attention to and advocate on behalf of safe injection practices. Dr. McKnight was infected with Hepatitis C virus, HCV while battling a reoccurrence of breast cancer in 2000. In total 99 residents at the same oncology clinic became infected with HCV. When their provider failed to follow safe injection practices. For years, this was the largest known healthcare associated outbreak of HCV in US history. [MUSIC] >> Let's not let that happen, again. Judges, are we ready for our first contestants? >> [MUSIC] >> So, tell me Kim, what does it mean to you to be appearing on The Technique? >> OMG! I'm on television! Okay. Breathe, Kim, breathe. >> [LAUGH] >> Okay. [SOUND] Rob, it means everything to be on the technique. My boyfriend and I drove in from Oklahoma to be here, and I practiced my safe injection techniques on him the whole way in the car. >> Wow, well if that isn't a dedicated boyfriend, I don't know what is. So tell me, what's your specialty back in Oklahoma? >> Well, to be honest. I've been shadowing my mentors at the nursing home, and I'm staying late at night post shift and learning the more unusual techniques. And you know, getting my performance up to speed. >> Well, let's see if Kim's night shifts have been paying off for her and her boyfriend. [MUSIC] >> Let's pick out rising stars in the safe injection category. >> Competence, energy, attitude, that is what I am looking for. >> It looks like showmanship is really going to make a difference in today's tryouts. Gene, what are you looking for in our hopefuls? >> Rob what we're really looking for today is safe injection practices, so that's what I'm gonna make sure we're gonna focus on. Now I'm not denying that energy and attitude aren't important, but I'm looking for essential technical practices that can make the difference between life and death. >> Let's take a closer look at the judges criteria for our contestants here today. >> CDC reminds healthcare personnel of the following practices that are critical for resident safety. Now, we will be looking for strict adherence to these practices from our contestants today. Never administer medications from the same syringe to more than one resident or to the same resident at another time, even if the needle is changed or you are injecting through an intervening link of IV tubing. Needles and syringes are single use items. Do not enter a medication vile, bag, or bottle with a used syringe or needle. Never use medications packaged as single dose or single use for more than one resident. This includes ampoules, bags, and bottles of intravenous solutions. Always, always use strict aseptic technique when preparing and administering injections. >> So there it is folks. One needle, one syringe, one time use, and only one person. >> So Kim from Oklahoma, what do you have in store for us today? >> Hi Stefan, Minerva. Well, today I am going to show you proper usage of a single use vial. >> Let's bring out our residence for Kim. They're beautiful. >> She's carefully reading the order. She sees the single dose vial. She is doing great so far. You can see she's really thinking through the steps before she performs. Here she goes. The hand hygiene looks good, spending the appropriate amount of time with the hand sanitizer. Product rubbing, now she's put on gloves, she's putting on the gloves next. Yeah, here we go. Now she's disinfecting the rubber septum with alcohol prior to piercing it. Aseptic technique looks great. She's preparing the clean needle and syringe. That's appropriate entrance to the vial with the needle. [MUSIC] Okay she's administering the injection, very nice. Looks like the judges agree too. >> She smiling, she knows she nailed it. >> And she's disposing of the injection equipment properly. >> What is she doing? >> [INAUDIBLE] >> Wait a minute, she is keeping the syringe and setting up the same single dose vial? Oh, no, manasteris. [SOUND] >> Kim, I'm sorry, but some rookie mistakes here. Clearly, you intended on using the same syringe on the next resident and you were intending on using the medicine from the same vial. >> [COUGH] >> Yeah, I'm gonna have to agree with Stephan on this one, I, unacceptable. Huh, one needle, one syringe, only one time. You do not have the technique. >> Kim, you've got some great techniques down, but you still have a lot of work ahead of you. Now you must remember that after you use them, the syringe and the needle are both contaminated and must be discarded. You always use a new syringe and needle for each resident. >> What a disappointing turn of events for Kim from Oklahoma. But the road to the winner's circle is just beginning. [MUSIC] Cut, cut, cut, singing auditions are down the hall. [MUSIC] >> Perhaps I spoke too soon. But I've got a great feeling about this next contestant. Jennifer was actually at the auditions last year but tripped and sprained her wrist on the way up to the stage. >> [NOISE] >> Ever since that fateful moment when I broke my wrist, I new that proper aseptic technique was going to be the area I really scored well in. Spending the correct amount of time washing and then gloving properly, I have this competition in the bag. [APPLAUSE] My name is Jennifer Abrams, and I'm from Spring Lake Nursing Home in Charleston, South Carolina. >> Jennifer, let's see what you've got. [MUSIC] Hand hygiene looks good, spending the appropriate amount of hand-rubbing. Donning the gloves. And her aseptic technique looks good. [MUSIC] She's now preparing the syringe and the needle. [MUSIC] >> I'm not sure if she's got the capability to use vial. We've set that up for her, it's tricky trap. >> Oh, the judges threw her a curve ball. It's a multi dose vial, let's see how she handles it. >> She didn't label it, it's too late. >> Oh Jennifer, she just set that vile down without labeling it. That's going to cost her. Is it enough of an error though to keep her from advancing to round two? >> Tell me, Jennifer, what type of vial you're using and what should you have done after opening and assessing it the first time? >> Oh Stefan, it's a multi-dose vial and I should have used a 28 day beyond use date I can't believe I forgot to do something so simple. >> To be perfectly honest, you should have noticed that first thing. But you did dispose of the injection equipment properly, and the gloves, which shows you're no spring chicken to this in-house. Stephan, you and your chickens can go back to Britian. >> Whoa. >> [LAUGH] >> You're right, she had very good hand hygiene after disposing of the equipment. I say, bravo Jennifer, love it. >> But forgetting to label that vial is not something to overlook. I mean it's important that she labels each multi use vial with a new expiration date. She made an error right off the bat. >> For anyone not familiar with labeling multi use vials, the expiration date is 28 days from the date it was opened and first accessed >> Unless a shorter time is specified by the manufacturer. It's kinda like my self-tanning lotion. >> So, what do we think gang? Is her failure to label the vile properly? Enough to cost her advancement into round two? >> I say, she passes. Girfriend nursed herself back to health after a broken wrist, and she's brought her A game. Even if there was a slight oversight, which she recognized. >> I hear what you're saying but an error is an error. I have to say no. >> True Gene, but I have to go with Minerva on this one. My gut says advance. Congratulations Jennifer, you're going on to round two. >> [APPLAUSE] >> What do the judges have in store for them next? Find out tomorrow night as we continue with round one of The Technique. >> [APPLAUSE] >> [MUSIC].",""

The diagram here shows the types of pathogens listed from most resistant on top to most susceptible at the bottom. It is important to select the disinfectant to kill the pathogens of concern. C difficile spores are challenging to eliminate because they are resistant to commonly used disinfectants. And can persist in the environment for long periods of time. In order to remove and kill C difficile spores, an EPA-registered sporicidal disinfectant must be used. The most commonly used disinfectant for C difficile is a 1:10 dilute bleach solution. Meticulous daily cleaning-disinfection of frequently touched surfaces and shared equipment has been shown to greatly reduce healthcare worker hand contamination. Thus reducing the likelihood of cross-transmission to other residents. Norovirus is also resistant to many commonly used disinfectants. It is important to use an EPA-registered disinfectant with a claim against norovirus or 1:10 dilute bleach solution. Norovirus is very contagious and spreads quickly around a long term care facility. When an outbreak is identified, intensify cleaning interventions in order to reduce the likelihood of cross-transmission. The frequency of cleaning should be increased to two times per day on wards and units. And three times per day in infected resident rooms. It is important when cleaning to start with the least contaminated areas. Moving to highly contaminated areas like the bathroom, to avoid inadvertent contamination of clean surfaces. It is also important to wear the appropriate PPE gowns, glove and mask when cleaning rooms and large spills of vomit or fecal material. Blood and body fluid spills also present a hazard to the residents and staff in long term care facilities. And should be cleaned up quickly and according to established guidelines. Guidelines from OSHA and CDC on proper cleaning and decontamination of blood and body fluid spills are shown here. In summary, it is the responsibility of long term care facilities to provide a safe and sanitary environment for both residents and staff. Through effective and thorough cleaning disinfection of surfaces and equipment, potential reservoirs of pathogens are eliminated. And the risk of cross-transmission is reduced significantly. All staff responsible for cleaning-disinfection of surfaces and equipment should be provided with the appropriate tools, training, audits and feedback to maintain good infection prevention and control practices.",""

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/Set1Z/4-2-how-to-clean-the-environment-effectively","4.2 How to clean the environment effectively","Cleaning is defined as the physical removal of dirt, body fluids, and other organic matter. Cleaning is achieved through the use of a detergent, water, and applied friction. Disinfection is the destruction of pathogens on a surface. This is most commonly done through the use of the environmental protection agency, EPA, registered chemical. Disinfection can also be achieved through the application of heat, ultraviolet light, or vaporized hydrogen peroxide. A surface cannot be disinfected unless it has been cleaned because organic matter can interfere with some disinfectants. Disinfection reduces the number of pathogens on a surface to a level where they are unlikely to cause harm. However, the use of a disinfectant does not produce a sterile surface. Though defined separately here, cleaning and disinfection is a one-step process, and occurs simultaneously when applying a disinfectant to a surface. As such, it is not necessary to pre-clean a surface prior to disinfection unless the surface is heavily contaminated with blood or body fluids. As we proceed through this module we will refer to this one-step process as Cleaning Disinfection. The decision to use a particular disinfectant requires careful consideration of multiple variables. First, the product must be an EPA registered disinfectant. In the United States the EPA registers all surface disinfecting products and indicates their level of effectiveness against certain pathogens. The product selected should be EPA-registered for use in healthcare. Next, consider the different pathogens a disinfectant kills. It is important to check the product label to ensure that it has a kill claim against the pathogens of concern. Other variables to considered are the safety and toxicity to residents and staff and any potential damage to equipment and surfaces due to materials incompatibility. There are many methods available to apply disinfectants including cotton cloths, disposable wipes and microfiber. The method of application is a matter of choice dependent primarily on the availability, convenience and cost of laundering reusable application products. If using a reusable method, make sure that the material is durable and can survive repeated use and cleaning. It is also important to ensure that the cloth you are using is large enough and wet enough to clean the intended surface. Cloths and wipes are available that maintain wetness to cover a certain surface area. A wet cloth will effectively kill and remove pathogens easily, but a dried out wipe will spread pathogens over the surface and not effectively remove them. Once the wiper cloth is dried out or contaminated on both sides, it must be discarded. It is also important not to double-dip. That is, returning a soiled cloth or mop back into the disinfectant. This practice contaminates the disinfectant over time and spreads bacteria rather than removing it. It is important to change cloths, mops, and disinfecting solutions frequently to ensure adequate cleaning. Items must be exposed to the disinfectant for the appropriate minimum contact time, which can range from 1 to 10 minutes, depending on the disinfectant. This information is also specified on the product label. It is best to evaluate multiple disinfectants and to select the disinfectant with the lowest contact time possible to avoid the need for multiple application should the product dry on the surface before the required contact time has elapsed. All staff should be trained to use the longest contact time on the label to simplify training, and improve compliance. As a final note, EPA requires that manufacturers state on the label, that it is a violation of federal law to use this product in a manner that is inconsistent with its labeling. Regulatory agencies like CMS have interpreted this statement to mean the longest contact time on the label and are audited using this interpretation. Because occupational diseases among environmental services staff have been associated with the use of several disinfectants, precaution should be taken to minimize exposure. Precautions include wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment when mixing and using disinfectant chemicals. Safe storage and labeling of disinfectants, and proper ventilation of areas where chemicals are mixed, stored, and used. Different disinfectant products should not be mixed together. It is important to follow safety precautions found on the safety data sheet, SDS, provided by the manufacturer. The SDS should be on file and readily available to staff. Now, back to Sunnyside with Charlie and Sarah. >> Charlie, I already feel better about my job here at Sunnyside Nursing Home. I really can make a difference. >> Let's not get too hasty, Sarah. Cleaning isn't a single-celled organism. It's got many parts to it, and all those parts are to prevent the spread of infection to residents everywhere. >> Tell me more. >> Well, environmental surfaces, like the bed, and this table, even the windowsill, are contaminated with germs, such as bacteria and fungi, and can be a reservoir for infections for residents. In fact, I just read this cool study, that showed that residents colonized or infected with antibody resisting bacteria like MRSA or VRE contaminated their environment. And when that room is not clean well, after they have been discharged the next resident is at risk for becoming colonized or infected with the same germ. >> Wow I had no idea, why is that? >> Well it turns out that while we thought we were doing a good job cleaning rooms between residents, we really weren't. We often miss hand contact surfaces and items in the room that were contaminated, which led to an increased risk that the next resident might get the germ that was infecting the other resident. That reminds me, we need to talk about the second P, practice. Have you ever thought about which surfaces to clean in a room? >> No, not really, I just try and wipe what looks dirty and hope I haven't missed a spot. >> Sorry my friend, it's not enough to only clean what looks dirty, we should try to be as thorough as possible when we clean residence rooms and wipe every surface. Let me show you a little something I've patented as my signature move around here. I call it the Triple Threat. >> Triple Threat. >> Triple Threat? >> The Triple Threat. One, two, Three, clean. Three means clean. Three times the cleaning power in each action. It's not just product that's going to get this place clean, it's good practice and thoroughness. >> I'm not sure I understand how this works and what you mean by thoroughness. >> Here, let me show you. Charlie? What is that? >> Well, what you see here is that I've secretly put dots scattered across this room to see how we're coming with your cleaning. Where did you say you've wiped so far? >> I thought I was done with this room. >> Well Sarah, every place that you see these dots still showing up, means that you don't give that area the cleaning job that I know that you're capable of. >> So you're telling me all of these surfaces need to be wiped over again? Sara, this is not a race to see who finishes first. Remember, it is about the thoroughness of cleaning. We use the dots to simulate surface contamination. When you wipe over the dot, you remove it, which indicates you have adequately cleaned the surface. Here's the best part. You never know when I'm going to dot a room. So, you have to do a great time every time! >> So what should I clean? >> You should be cleaning from cleanest to dirtiest, saving the bathroom and floor for the end. As for as surfaces, you should focus your attention on the touchable surfaces, especially closest to the resident. These will be things like the bed rails, the frame, the call button, the door knobs, things like that. >> I can see my day just got a lot longer. >> Don't think of it as longer. Think of it as more effective. We have a great product. But without great practice and attention to detail, we cannot do our part to reduce the chance of residence getting infections.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/3kdt4/4-1-the-role-of-the-environment-in-disease-transmission","4.1 The role of the environment in disease transmission","Welcome to module 4, Environmental Disinfection. The learning objectives for this module are, discuss the role of the environment in disease transmission. Understand how improving environmental disinfection can reduce healthcare-acquired infections. Until recently, the role of the environment in disease transmission has been thought to be insignificant. Recent studies have shown that several major pathogens, like MRSA, VRE, C.difficile, and norovirus are shed by colonized, and then infected residents, and contaminates surfaces at levels sufficient for transmission. In fact, several items closest to residents, including bed lines, side rails, overbed tables, and other surfaces are extensively contaminated. On average, about one-third of surfaces harbor pathogens when sampled. In addition to extensive contamination, these pathogens can also survive on surfaces for extended periods of time. And can remain on these surfaces despite attempts to disinfect, and remove them. Incomplete cleaning and disinfection procedures, combined with the persistence of pathogens in the environment, increase the likelihood that healthcare worker hands will be unknowingly contaminated. Poor hand hygiene, delayed recognition and isolation of colonized or infected residents, and insufficient environmental cleaning disinfection can lead to contact with, and transmission of pathogens. Pathogen transfer from a colonized, or infected resident to a susceptible resident occurs most commonly by way of healthcare provider hands. But contaminated surfaces and equipment can be involved in the transmission pathway, either directly via direct resident contact with a contaminated surface, or indirectly through healthcare providers contacting contaminated surfaces, and then contacting residents. Let's join Charlie as he makes the rounds at Sunny Side Nursing Home, sharing his tips for achieving the ultimate clean. >> [SOUND] Are you tired of struggling with cleaning supplies? Are all those products just too much to handle? [SOUND] Well, turn that frown upside down, there's a better way! [MUSIC] >> Triple P. >> Hey, Sara! Welcome to the Environmental Service Crew here at Sunnyside Nursing Home. It's good to see a new face around here. I'm Charlie, I got your name from the nurses' station, and I wanted to see how your day was going. >> It's going well here so far, and you? >> It's going great, just working on the three Ps. >> The three what? >> Sarah, don't tell me you don't know the three Ps of environmental disinfection? Product, practice, and perfection? Say it with me. Product, practice and perfection. >> Practice and perfection. [LAUGH] What do you mean? >> All right, Sarah. Since you don't know, I'll let you in on a secret to my success. Let's talk about product first. >> Well, I have this solution here, what else is there to know? >> Oh, Sarah, there is so much more that you need to know. Do you know how to apply it, or how long it needs to stay on the contact surface? >> I can't say that I do. I think they may have skipped that part in class. [LAUGH] >> You were sleeping, but never mind. We use an EPA approved hospital disinfectant to clean rooms here at Sunnyside. There are two important things you need to know. You need to know how to disinfect appropriately, how to apply it, and the contact time. >> Well, I've been using this microfiber mop to clean the floors, and these cloths to clean surfaces. >> That's a start, but have you been changing the mop and cloths for every room? >> Wow, Charlie, I didn't know I need to do that. Well, the mop didn't look dirty, and neither did the cloths. >> You need to change the mop for every room, and you should change the cloth four to seven times per room every cleaning. You also need to make sure that the mop and the cloths are wet enough to achieve the necessary contact time. >> I don't understand contact time. >> Contact time is the time it takes for the disinfectant to kill certain germs. This is anywhere from one to ten minutes depending on the disinfectant you are using. If you're wipers not wet enough, the surface won't stay wet long enough to kill the germs. You will be spreading germs around the surface, but not removing them. >> [SOUND] Wow, Charlie, I had no idea. I have been doing this all wrong. >> It's not a matter of right versus wrong. Oh, wait, [LAUGH] yes, it is. [LAUGH] >> Are you confused about which product to use? Does cleaning a room just scare you? Well, say goodbye to fright, and think of cleaning in a positive light. Gone are the days when you doubt what you are doing makes a difference. With fresh disinfectant solution, each room and each item you clean [SOUND] will be clean. Overtime your mop, cloths, and disinfectant become more, and more contaminated during use. And become less, and less effective. If you don't change them appropriately, you end up contaminating surfaces, and not cleaning them. It's the science of pure technology that you can not clean something with something that's not clean.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/ikhBL/5-4-prevention-of-utis","5.4 Prevention of UTIs","When considering the prevention on UTIs much can be done to promote good urinary health among all residents health in a facility. Without adequate hydration the bladder cannot be sufficiently flushed out. Unfortunately many elderly do not drink adequate fluid and are at risk for experiencing dehydration. With dehydration comes the heightened risk of UTI, pneumonia, pressure ulcers, disorientation and electrolyte imbalances. The general recommendation is to consume the greater of 30 milliliters of fluid per kilogram per body weight or 1.5 liters per day. For a 150 pound man, the ideal fluid intake would be 2 liters per day. Another step in promoting good urinary health is to encourage mobility, even in those that are bed bound. Several studies have demonstrated that improving mobility and exercise greatly reduces UTIs and can protect against hospitalizations for UTIs. Mobility and exercise reduce long periods of urinary stasis in the bladder, improves voiding and can help to prevent or better manage incontinence which leads to improved urinary health. Promoting complete bladder emptying is also very important. Residents should empty their bladders every three to four hours or should be on programmed toileting if not able to go on their own. For those incontinent of stool, provide timely removal and good perineal care, cleaning from front to back, toward the bottom. Constipation prevention is very important for promoting good urinary health. In elders, marked or severe constipation has been noted to contribute to bladder instability and may encourage UTI by creating a degree of bladder outlet obstruction. In terms of prevention, there is evidence from several studies that indicates that cranberries and cranberry derived substances can prevent bacterial adherence, especially of E coli, to urinary epithelial cells. Pathogens are more easily flushed from the urinary tract, and infection risk is then minimized. In studies, a minimum of 300 milligrams to 400 milligrams of cranberry extract taken twice daily or 8 to 16 ounces of at least 30% cranberry juice blend is needed for this therapeutic effect. Cranberry regimens should be started in consultation with a physician, as it can interact with some medications. It appears that in post menopausal women, estrogen deficiency has been linked to increased UTIs. The use of intravaginal estrogen cream is effective in reducing UTIs in elderly women. Alternatives to end dwelling urine catheters should be considered based on the resident's individual care needs. In general, alternative devices and procedures providing much lower risk of infectious complications such as a UTI. These alternative methods can also reduce or eliminate the non-infectious complications associated with indwelling catheters namely, immobility and discomfort. The three alternatives are programmed toileting, intermittent catheterization used in combination with bladder ultrasound and condom catheters for males. Programmed toileting typically consists of a resident specific assessment of incontinence, followed by a program of prompted voiding, habit retraining and or time to voiding as part of an individualized care plan. Evidence from one investigation demonstrates toileting programs can significantly lessen risk of falls, skin breakdown and if lifting technology is available back injuries experienced by personnel during patient assists. Emphasis on self voiding also result in less post void residual compared to use of indwelling urinary catheters. Intermittent catheterization, often used in residents with neurogenic bladder or spinal cord injuries lessens the risk of UTIs. Intermittent catheterization is preferable to indwelling or superpubic catheters in residents with bladder emptying dysfunction. Intermittent catheterization should be performed at regular intervals to avoid over distending the bladder. When combined with portable bladder ultrasound, unnecessary catheterizations can be avoided if the resident has insufficient quantities of urine to justify catheterization. Condom catheters are a safer alternative in men who are able to void spontaneously. They are ideal for night time use and are less restrictive than indwelling catheters. Condom drainage is also associated with a lower risk of bacterial colonization and UTIs compared to indwelling catheters. There are some drawbacks, including improper fit, urinary leakage and skin breakdown over the penis and inner thighs. Though these can be mitigated by selecting the appropriate size, appropriate tethering techniques and using barrier creams. Catheter associated UTIs are common and carry increased risk of complications and morbidity. Every attempt must be made to minimize the duration of short-term catheterization and to avoid long-term catheterization altogether. To assist with this, federal regulations specifically tag F-315, mandates that certain criteria be met in order to justify the use of an indwelling catheter in a long-term facility. F 315 states that an indwelling catheter should only be used when there is a valid medical justification. The resident should be assessed for and provided care and treatment needed to reach his or her highest level of continence possible. The facility is expected to show evidence of any medical factors which caused the intervention. The table shown here walks through the steps of management of a urinary catheter. First, verify that the resident meets one of the qualifying conditions, if the resident does not, seek an alternative method from management. If the resident does meet the criteria for placement of a catheter, it should be done using sterile equipment and aseptic technique to avoid introduction of pathogens during insertion. Once the catheter is inserted, the need for continued use of the urinary catheter should be assessed daily. It should be secured using a catheter lock. Urine flow should be unobstructed. And the bag should be placed below the level of the resident and should not rest on the floor. Additionally, it is important that the system remains closed and intact and any time the system is manipulated or accessed, it is done so aseptically. Finally, the drainage bag should be emptied using a dedicated clean container. If the resident no longer requires the catheter, it should be removed promptly. Review this list of ten things residents can do to improve urinary health. Today, you learned how to differentiate between asymptomatic bacterial colonization and a true symptomatic UTI, and the indications for treating UTIs. You also learned good urinary health practices that you can promote among residents including improved mobility, hydration, regular toileting and constipation management. In addition, you learned that indwelling urinary catheters should be avoided when possible, and alternative management strategies should be used. If a catheter is needed due to an indicated condition, it should be inserted aseptically, managed appropriately and removed promptly when no longer needed.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/fEd4E/5-3-treating-utis","5.3 Treating UTIs","We already know that up to 40% or more of residents without an indwelling catheter, have asymptomatic colonization of the urinary tract, and that a positive culture is a common and expected finding at any time. When localizing and systemic symptoms or signs such as fever or shaking chills, painful urination, blood in urine, pain or tenderness along the urinary tract and a new or increased frequency, urgency or incontinence are also present, diagnosis and treatment of a UTI is appropriate. In residents without any signs or symptoms who have a positive urinalysis and positive culture, there are often benign findings and should not be treated, as this can be harmful to the resident. Prescribing antibiotics is the subject of increased scrutiny due to the overuse of antibiotics, and resulting resistance to antibiotics that many organisms develop. The upward trend of C Difficile diarrhea cases and increasing antibiotic resistance has led to the positive practice of shifting from broad to narrow spectrum antibiotics. The use of narrow spectrum antibiotics is based on the need for accurate diagnosis, and the importance of obtaining cultures in the elderly population before starting antibiotics. Local antibiotic resistance patterns are increasingly utilized for aiding in the prescribing of antibiotics to ensure that the infecting bacteria and available antibiotics are appropriately matched up. When clinicians are selecting antibiotics for treating UTIs, they should follow evidence-based clinical guidelines, such as those published by the Infectious Disease Society of America, or other professional societies. Clinicians faced with the decision to treat with antibiotics or employ monitor and observe, often opt for antibiotics due to the concerns over missing an infection, delaying treatment, or not meeting a resident's or family's expectations. In doing so, physicians overvalue the benefits of antibiotic therapy, while undervaluing the strong likelihood of negative outcomes related to treating asymptomatic bacterial colonization such as Clostridium difficile, adverse drug events, and antibiotic resistance. The appropriate choice is to monitor and observe the resident, which is called watchful waiting. The example observation order set, shown here, ensures that the resident is receiving supportive care, provides reassurance that the resident is being adequately cared for, and emphasizes prompt communication for changes in condition. The goal of treatment for UTI is to alleviate symptoms, not to create a sterile bladder. If the resident appears to be responding to the therapy, it is not necessary to re-culture after a course of antibiotics. Polymicrobial bacteriuria often persists after a course of antibiotics and does not mean the treatment has failed. A urine test alone does not provide sufficient information. Increases the risk of treating asymptomatic bacteriuria, as well as the risk of adverse drug events, C difficile infection, and antimicrobial resistance. To sum up, a positive urinalysis and or urine culture only tells you that bacteria are present in the bladder, and does not necessarily indicate an infection. For a UTI to be present, the resident must have systemic and or local signs and symptoms and a positive culture. Only then should an infection be treated.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/Nlc32/5-2-diagnosing-a-uti","5.2 Diagnosing a UTI","How do you diagnose a UTI? Let's look at the example given in the video. Elaine had some general non-specific symptoms like feeling weak and fatigued, these could be caused by any number of things. Including dehydration, medication side effects, poor sleep, or the start of an infection. Those symptoms, alone, would not be enough of an indication to test. When the nurse asked questions, Elaine said she was experiencing some urinary-specific symptoms that are indicative of a potential infection. Suprapubic tenderness, new onset of frequency, and new onset of urgency. This information from the resident prompted the next step. Take a careful look at the cause of the symptoms and collect a urine specimen for testing. Here are general guidelines for what to do whenever you're deciding whether the person should have their urine tested. The first step is to decide whether the person has fever or any signs or symptoms suggestive of a urinary infection. If the answer is yes, the doctor should be notified and urine should be sent for testing. If the answer is no, fluids, toileting, and hygiene management and close monitoring for clinical changes are appropriate. As a note, urine testing should only be performed when there is a reasonable likelihood the resident may have an UTI as judged by meeting the minimal criteria listed here. Over testing leads to over treatment, which can cause adverse events from unnecessary antibiotics. UTI is less likely without the specific symptoms listed previously. Non specific symptoms such as a sudden change in behavior, fatigue, or a fall may be caused by other factors including dehydration, hypo or hyperglycemia, depression, poor sleep, medication side effects, hypoxia, constipation, or pain. It is important to consider these other possible causes of the residents symptoms. Residents with significantly advanced dementia present a challenge, because they often have minimal to no verbal communication. This makes it nearly impossible for them to meaningfully express typical symptoms. Moreover these residents also have profound cognitive deficits and urinary incontinence, which makes mental status changes hard to discern and urinary frequency difficult to detect. Fever alone may be adequate evidence of UTI, so long as there are no additional symptoms, such as new cough to suggest an alternative source of infection. Other symptoms, such as Leukocytosis or Hemodynamic instability may also be helpful. Any treatment decisions made regarding infections in this population have to incorporate the resonance preferences regarding the goal of their care as defined by their health care proxies. The potential disadvantages to work up in treatment of a suspected UTI in residents with advanced dementia may outweigh the advantages, particularly when the likelihood of UTI is low. After collecting Elaine's urine using an in-and-out catheter, the following results come back from the urinalysis. Let's take a look at what each one means. First, we know that there is a small amount of blood present in the urine. This can result from an infection or catheter trauma. Next, we note that the urine is positive for Nitrites, which is the result of bacteria in the urine. This is confirmed by the three plus bacteria also noted. A positive nitrite can be caused by bacterial colonization, contamination, or infection. The sample is also positive for Leukocyte Esterase, which indicates the presence of white blood cells in the urine. This too, is confirmed by the high number of white blood cells seen under the microscope. The presence of Pus or pyuria in older adults can be caused by an infection, but can also be caused by bladder or kidney inflammation without an infection. When looked at in total, the urinalysis is only helpful when trying to rule out an infection. When nitrite and leukocyte esterase are both negative this means there is a very low likelihood of an infection. When one or both are positive as is often the case with nursing home residence the meaning of the results depends on the culture result and clinical signs and symptoms present. A positive urine culture is necessary for a diagnosis of a UTI. For residents without an indwelling catheter, at least 100,000 colony forming units per milliliter of no more than two species of micro organisms is the recommended count for a voided specimen. For a specimen collected by in and out catheterization at least 100 colony forming units per millilitre of any number of organisms is recommended. Before urine samples for culture are obtained from residents with a chronic indwelling catheter in place for more than 14 days. The original urinary catheter should be removed and replaced, and the specimen should be obtained from the new catheter. For residents with indwelling catheters present, at least 100,000 colony forming units per mililiter of any number of organisms is required for a diagnosis of a UTI. Let's look at Elaine's results. It shows that her urine grew more than 100,000 colony forming units per millilitre of E.coli, with resistance to ampicillin, bactrim, and cipro. So, what does this culture result tell us? As with your analysis, it only tells part of the story. Elaine has bacteria in her urine that could cause an infection, but it is not enough to distinguish between colonization and infection. Again, we need to rely on the resident's clinical signs and symptoms to see the complete picture. In the elderly population, a wide spectrum of infecting organisms can cause Urinary Tract Infections, and many infecting organisms have developed increased anti-microbial resistance. E.coli is the most frequently isolated organism. Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococci species are also frequently isolated. >> Well, it looks like Mrs. Houston has a urinary tract infection. I would have expected her to be much more uncomfortable than she seems. Now that we know that she has one though, what should we do? >> And cut. >> Hey, guys. Remember me? Content expert. I'm sorry to interrupt but we have a lot of information to convey in this scene and I just wanna make sure that you can handle it. >> Hi, Jean. >> We've been like rehearsing our lines all day. >> I am glad to hear that. So, you know that just because a resident has bacteria in their urine does not mean they have an infection. Older persons, especially in long term healthcare facilities, are known to have bladders that are colonized with bacteria, but they never exhibit symptoms of infection. That's why it is very important to tell the difference between Bacterial Colonization of the Bladder and Symptomatic Urinary Tract Infection. Never treat colonization with an antibiotic. Only symptomatic urinary tract infection. Now in Mrs. Houston's situation, she has symptoms that warrant the use of an antibiotic. Super pubic pain, frequency, urgency, and a positive lab result. >> Okay, I think we've got it. Our characters won't let you down. >> Great, you're doing great. >> And, action. >> I already talked to Dr. Kennedy and he said to start Mrs. Houston on level floxacin. >> Okay, I'll go get the medication and I'll meet you in Mrs. Houston's room. I can't bear to break anymore bad news by myself. [MUSIC] >> Hello, Mrs. Houston. Well, we got your test results back, and it appears you have a Urinary Tract Infection. >> Good grief, you've gotta be kidding me. >> I'm afraid it's no joke. We're gonna start you on an antibiotic to help your body fight the infection. It's going to be very important that you finish the entire course of medicine. >> How did I get a urinary tract infection? >> Well, Mrs. Houston, you may be experiencing normal changes that occur with age. Limited mobility and poor hydration. You really have been distracted watching David on the TV and not taking care of yourself as well as you could. >> A cut. >> You should also point out that people with a urinary catheter or those experiencing functional or cognitive impairment are at greater risk for UTIs. >> Cognitive impairment. How dare you. My character was fit as a fiddle until you put me in this joint. >> Of course, but generally speaking functional and cognitive impairment can lead to a decrease in self care, decreased cues to void. Difficulty in finding a location to void and an elevated residual volume of urine in the bladder. All of these are risk factors that can contribute to urinary tract infections. >> Action. >> And that's all there is to it? Watching David on the TV gave me this Urinary Tract Infection. >> Well, Mrs. Houston instead of focusing on how you got the UTI, let's talk about how to prevent another one in the future, like better hydration, regular toileting, improved personnel care, and increased mobility. >> I need to go check on the other residents. So I'm gonna let Priscilla finish up here and give you the medication. >> You'll be taking a medicine called Levofloxacin. You're gonna take one pill once a day for five days. This should help clear up the infection and get you back on your feet in no time. Just in time to see how that new hip was treating you. >> Five days you say? Well Elaine, that's not so bad. >> Well, I feel better already, you're right Dimitri. Just bring me a whole pitcher of water. >> [LAUGH] >> Oh, that's the spirit. Elaine, I've never noticed that beautiful locket you have. >> Elaine had me bring that to her from home. She wanted it here closer to her heart. >> Well you'll have to tell me about that special locket the next time I check in on you. >> I will, Priscilla. I will. [MUSIC] >> Next time.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/PPvPx/5-1-epidemiology-of-utis","5.1 Epidemiology of UTIs","Welcome to Preventing Urinary Tract Infections in Nursing Home Residents. This module is intended to help educate nursing home staff about the risk of urinary tract infections among the residents, and prevention strategies for helping residents stay healthy and UTI free. There are four objectives for this module. Describe the causes and risk factors for UTIs in nursing home residents. Differentiate between asymptomatic bladder colonization and symptomatic urinary tract infections in nursing home residents. Understand when and when not to test for and treat UTIs. Discuss prevention strategies to reduce the incidence of UTIs among residents. There are several definitions that you should know before proceeding with the module. A urinary tract infection is the invasion of the urinary system by a disease causing microorganism that is characterized by urinary tract specific symptoms in the setting of signficant bacteria in a urine specimen. Asymptomatic bacteriuria, or asymptomatic bladder colonization, is the presence of bacteria in the urine without any urinary tract specific signs or symptoms suggestive of a UTI. Pyuria is the presence of white blood cells, or pus, in the urine, indicating inflammation of the urinary tract due to infectious or non-infectious causes. Urinary tract infection is one of the most commonly diagnosed infections in older adults, and is the most frequently diagnosed infection in long term care residents, accounting for over a third of all nursing home associated infections. Data from several studies suggests that the rate of symptomatic UTI in non-catheterized residents is around 1.1% of the population. This is substantially lower than the rate of symptomatic UTIs among residents with an indwelling catheter, which has been measured at 5.5% of the population. UTIs are a common reason for hospitalizations, comprising almost 30% of hospital readmissions from nursing homes within 30 days. Nationally, 5 to 10% of long term care residents have urinary catheters in place. Of new residents admitted to nursing homes from hospitals, 12% have urinary catheters present upon transfer. Because of this high frequency of residents with catheters in place upon transfer to long term care facilities, it is important that a medical justification for the catheter is provided by the sending facility and the resident is assessed upon admission for continued need. The presence of bacteria in the bladders of older adults residing in long term care facilities is often normal and increases considerably with age for both men and women. For instance, in women residing in the community, the estimated prevalence of asymptomatic colonization of the bladder is 1-5%, increasing to almost 20% in women over the age of 80. In long term care facilities, the prevalence is much higher with rates reaching up to 50%. For men, the trend is the same. The use of urinary catheters predisposes men and women to asymptomatic bladder colonization. The risk in catheterized older adults ranges from 3 to 10% per day of catheterization, reaching 100% in chronically catheterized residents. To summarize, bacteria in the bladder is often a normal and expected finding and does not by itself represent an infection. A number of factors predispose older persons to urinary tract infections. The use of urinary catheters and external urinary collection devices increase the frequency of colonization of the bladder. Asymptomatic bacteriouria is more common in people with cognitive impairment and urinary and fecal incontinence. Neurological conditions such as strokes, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are all common later in life and associated with impaired bladder emptying. Older people with diabetes also have an increased prevalence of asymptomatic bladder colonization, especially with contributing factors like neurogenic bladder and poor blood sugar control. In post menopausal women, decreased estrogen has been linked with increased colonization and increased urinary tract infections. In men, prostate enlargement leads to urinary symptoms and urinary retention, which can result in colonization and UTIs. A urinary tract infection, or UTI, occurs when bacteria or germs get into the urinary tract and multiply. The urinary tract is made up of the bladder, urethra, and the two ureters and kidneys. These germs usually enter the urinary tract through the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body, and travel up to the bladder. The result is redness, swelling and pain in the urinary tract. When a catheter is in place, this creates an easy avenue for the bacteria to enter the bladder. Bacteria can travel up the outside of the catheter, or can enter the bladder through the lumen of the catheter itself, especially when the system is disconnected, or the collection bag becomes contaminated. >> Previously on Gowns and Gloves, an MRSA outbreak has kept the nurses busy at Sunnyside as they work hard to contain the infection and keep their residents calm. Meanwhile, Elaine Houston and her husband Dimitri have been busy trying to confirm that Priscilla is in fact Mrs. Houston's long lost granddaughter. Will their search for answers prove fruitful, or are Mrs. Houston's infection troubles just a very sad turn of events? Will the nursing staff ever figure out the cause of the infections? And will David's recent win on The Technique cause a rift with his fellow Sunnyside nursing staff? Find out this week on Gowns and Gloves. >> [CROSSTALK]. >> Believe in it. [INAUDIBLE]. >> Where to begin. >> Amazing covers. >> I love David, crazy. Hey, David, welcome back. And congratulations on winning The Technique. >> Yes, welcome back. You're quite the celebrity. I saw you on the Today show. You and Minerva. It's Minazing! >> It's Mintastic! >> I don't know, it's getting on Minerves. >> [LAUGH] >> Oh, these are your 15 minutes of fame, you should enjoy them. >> Well fame and Minerva are fun, but now I'd rather practice my technique on people who really need me. >> Speaking of people who need you, your grandma has gone through quite an ordeal since arriving at Sunnyside. She's a funny one. You didn't tell me she and Dimitri were so intense. >> How so? >> Well, you'd almost think that they wanted to be stuck here at Sunnyside. And they keep asking for me to personally look after them. Vanessa doesn't stand a chance when she walks in the room. >> I have to admit it's getting on my nerves. >> It's funny, I was actually just gonna go see her. Wanna come with me? >> Sure, Vanessa and I were just about to go check in on her anyway. >> Great, let's go. >> Our plans are advancing. [INAUDIBLE] working to >> Grandma. >> David, sweetheart, how good to see you. I'm so proud of you for winning The Technique. I watched every episode on TV. Oh, but don't get too close. I've had all kinds of bugs. >> Grandma, tell me how you are. And by the way, I hear you've gotten close to my coworker, Priscilla. >> Oh, we have had the great pleasure of Priscilla's company and care. She has taken great care of your grandmother. Elaine, why don't you tell David about your ailments? >> Well as you know, I was admitted to Sunnyside after my hip surgery. Before I knew it, I was colonized with MRSA. Then I became infected and everybody, including Dimitri, was under contact precautions. Then I had the flu. And I had to go on droplet precautions, which means I had to wear a mask. [LAUGH] But, the funny thing is, that when both Priscilla and I had on masks, we looked so much alike that they just couldn't. >> [SOUND] Ahem. Why don't you go on with your story, dear? >> Oh, right. And now, now we're here. And I'm not feeling at all my best. >> Grandma, you need to work on gaining your strength back so that you can recuperate at home as soon as possible. >> David has a great point. You're almost ready to go home. >> Oh, [SOUND] actually I'm not feeling well at all today. I'm a little weak and woozy. >> Tell me more about your symptoms. Are you experiencing any discomfort or any changes from what is normal? >> Well, now that you mention it, I do have a little stomach pain. And I've been going to the bathroom more frequently. Sometimes I barely make it. >> Let's get a urine sample just to make sure everything's okay. Now that the MRSA outbreak is under control and no flu cases this week, we're gonna focus on getting you discharged, Mrs. Houston. But first, let's see if we can get you feeling a little bit better. >> Thank you. I appreciate that. >> Grandma, I'm heading out now. I'm on Letterman tonight, but then I'm headed home for good. >> Well, you remember to bring Minerva back with you. >> [LAUGH] Grandma. Okay. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/v8xuD/6-4-control-and-prevention-of-c-difficile","6.4 Control and Prevention of C. difficile","The first step in preventing C difficile is to prescribe and use antibiotics carefully. This includes not prescribing antibiotics when they are not needed such as with asymptomatic bacterial colonization and upper respiratory infections. And avoiding the just in case prescription. Decisions to prescribe should be justified by clinical findings and driven by culture results. If an antibiotic is prescribed, ensure that the orders include a dose, duration, and indication. When culture results come back in 24 to 48 hours, take an antibiotic time out to reassess therapy. It is important to decide if the antibiotic is still needed and more importantly that the antibiotic is still effective against the organism. A timeout is particularly helpful in long-term care facilities, where the clinician is not often on-site when prescribing the antibiotic or when culture results are reported. It is also important to monitor antibiotic prescribing practices within your facility. For instance, monitor prescribing practices around urinary tract infections and monitor for episodes when treatment was not indicated. This can be done by an infection preventionist who can feed back the information to the administration, clinical leadership, and prescribing clinicians. Finally, you can consider developing institutional specific guidelines and clinical pathways to direct prescribing to locally identified problem areas. The next step in controlling C difficile is to test residents when they have diarrhea while on antibiotics or within two months of receiving them. If C difficile is suspected, notify the physician and obtain a stool sample for toxin testing. It is important to immediately place residents with confirmed or suspected C difficile on contact precautions. This should be done as soon as a test is ordered to prevent transmission or spread. Waiting two or three days for results could allow other residents to be exposed and the patient could become very ill. It is important that staff and visitors wear gowns and gloves when entering the room even if they are not going to touch the resident. They should also be sure to wash hands only with soap and water after removing gowns and gloves and before leaving the room. Alcohol based hand sanitizers do not kill C difficile spores. It is also important that any equipment such as blood pressure cuff, stethoscope or thermometers be dedicated to residents with C difficile. If this is not possible, these shared items should be disinfected using a one to ten dilute bleach solution or an EPA registered sporicidal disinfectant between uses to prevent cross transmission. Residents should remain on contact precautions until the diarrhea has resolved and have formed stools for 48 hours. It is not necessary to perform a test because spores will still be present. In an ideal situation a private room with an attached bathroom is preferred for managing residents with C difficile infections. However this arrangement is not common in most long term care facilities. Managing a resident's diarrhea can often be difficult in a semi private room with a shared bathroom. If a roommate is not optional, two residents with C difficile can be cohorted in the same room or C difficile infected resident can be placed with a roommate who does not use the bathroom. If neither of these options is available, select a roommate who is not taking antibiotics and is not compromised to the point of being susceptible to infections and having the non C difficile infected resident use a bedside commode. In the event that a C difficile infected resident has to use a bedside commode, the commode should be lined with a plastic bag and absorbent material to reduce healthcare personnel exposure to fecal material. In order to preserve the dignity of residents and use the least restrictive approach to managing a resident with C difficile, some residents may be able to ambulate in the facility and participate in social activity. Assess the resident's bowel control and personal hygiene. If able to maintain bowel control and perform hand hygiene appropriately. Allow the resident to participate in activities when possible, prior to leaving the room have the resident wash their hands. Place a clean gown over the resident's clothing and disinfect any assistive devices. Any healthcare personnel who are assisting with ambulation should wear gloves and avoid touching items outside the resident's room without first removing the gloves and washing their hands. A gown may be needed if the workers are going to have more than hand contact with the infected resident. For those residents with chronic mental illness or dementia it is not always possible to ensure good compliance with control measures. Under these conditions it may be appropriate to provide one to one caregiving. As we stated previously, the environment plays an important role in the transmission of C difficile. Because C difficile is shed in diarrhea, any surface, item or medical device can become contaminated with spores and contribute to infection transmission. It is important that facility policies include strategies to prevent transmission from infected resident rooms to other parts of the facility. If environmental contamination is not controlled, hand contamination of health care personnel also increases. So it is important to clean frequently, thoroughly and with the right product. Disinfectants normally used in health care settings, usually quaternary ammonium compounds and phenolics are not sporicidal and will not kill C difficile spores. Only chlorine based disinfectants like bleach and a few newer EPA registered sporicidal agents are able to kill spores on surfaces and equipment. Generally, most facilities use a one to ten bleach solution for C difficile room cleaning. This solution is easily prepared by mixing one part household bleach with nine parts water. Frequently touched surfaces like the bed rail, call button, telephone, bathroom surfaces and over bed and bedside tables should be cleaned daily to reduce microbial contamination and hand transmission by healthcare workers. Any shared resident care items like blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, thermometers and lifts should be dedicated to affected residents if possible. Or be disinfected with the bleach solution before being used on another resident. The entire room should be cleaned when the resident is discharged. Failure to clean all surfaces on a terminal cleaning can put the next resident occupying the room at risk for acquiring C difficile. To learn more about environmental cleaning, see the environmental disinfecting module, module four. The final component of protecting against C difficile transmission is to improve communication when a resident is transferred to another facility. When transferring a resident with an active C difficile disease or a recent history of a C difficile disease, it is important to relay this information to the receiving facility, so that proper precautions can be instituted upon their arrival. It is also important to ask for this information when receiving a resident from another facility so that the proper precautions can be utilized upon arrival. Failures in communication between facilities can lead to transmission with in a facility because C difficile infection can go unrecognized for some time. Preventing C difficile infection and transmission can be done effectively if you, recognize the major reservoirs. Control surface contamination and hand transmission by frequently and thoroughly disinfecting surfaces with a bleach solution and by good hand washing with soap and water. Recognize and isolate infected residents early using contact precautions. Keep contact precautions in place as long as the resident has diarrhea. Once the resident has formed stools for 48 hours, the precautions can be discontinued. There is no need to retest following resolution of diarrhea, as spores will still be present after the diarrhea resolves. Insure that you share relevant infection related information with receiving facilities when transferring infected residents to other locations. Also, be sure to ask about infectious conditions of anyone being admitted or readmitted to your facility so the proper infection control interventions can be implemented.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/Rqt2n/6-3-cross-transmission-of-c-difficile","6.3 Cross-transmission of C. difficile","The two major reservoirs for C. difficile in healthcare settings are infected people and environmental services. With symptomatic people comprising the major reservoir. Studies looking at contaminated surfaces in healthcare settings have demonstrated that room contamination with C. difficile spores can reach 75% of surfaces in rooms of infected people. They have also found spores in rooms of people who do not have C. difficile indicating that cross transmission is occurring. Not surprisingly, bathrooms of infected people are also heavily contaminated with C. difficile spores. If environmental surfaces in the resident rooms and bathrooms are not adequately disinfected with an EPA registered sporicidal disinfectant, these surfaces can play a role in cross-transmission. C. difficile spores are very hardy in the environment, and can survive up to five months on surfaces that are not adequately cleaned and disinfected using and EPA registered sporicidal agent. There is data to suggest that many surfaces in health care environments are not adequately cleaned, which increases the risk for cross transmission even if the person with C. difficile is no longer in the room. Patients and health care personnel can transmit and acquire C. difficile from contact with contaminated surfaces and infected people. Studies have shown that 25% of healthcare providers' hands are contaminated with C. difficile spores after caring for infected patients. If the provider fails to wear gloves and wash their hands properly with soap and water, this can lead to cross-transmission to other residents, or themselves. >> Mrs. Houston, I told you, we have to move you to this room to ensure that the Clostridium difficile does not spread across the entire facility. I'm sure you don't want anyone to experience the discomfort you've been experiencing.

We've become, well, regulars here at Sunnyside. >> Regular? Well, I would like to be regular. Isn't that why they put us in this room? >> Well, kind of. This is called co-hoarding. You both have acquired a bad bug called Clostridium difficile, or C. dif for short. When we have a bad bug like C. dif in the facility, we try to put residents with the same bad bug together so that we can minimize the transmission of the bug across the entire facility. >> In other words, they've sent us to Siberia. >> Why don't you two introduce yourselves?

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/Jtem6/6-2-development-of-c-difficile-infection","6.2 Development of C. difficile Infection","The major factor contributing to acquisition of C difficil is systemic antibiotic use. Antibiotic exposure increases the risk of C difficile infection by at least 6 fold within the first 30 days, and 3 fold for 3 months following exposure. Up to 85% of patients with Clostridium Difficile infections have antibiotic exposure in the 28 days before infection. Antibiotic use increases the risk for C Difficile disease for the next 60 days. Older age has also been recognized as an important risk factor for C difficile acquisition and development of severe C difficile disease. This is likely due to a number of age related changes to the composition of the fecal flora, blunted immune responses, and reduced gastric acidity. Older adults also often have more than one condition at the same time, which can impact the ability to fight off infections. Recurrent hospitalizations and increased length of stay in health care also increases the risk for acquiring C difficile. The microbial flora of the intestines is incredibly diverse, with 200 to 1000 different species of microorganisms comprising about 100 trillion bacteria. When this ecosystem is intact, it helps us digest food, produce vitamins, and keep our immune systems in balance. It also provides protection to the intestines from invading microorganisms. This is called colonization resistance. Antibiotic therapy plays a central role in the pathogenesis of C Difficile infection. Particularly clindamycin, third-generation cephalosporins, penicillins, and fluoroquinolones. When antibiotics are consumed, the diversity and numbers of microorganism in the gut is drastically altered and reduces colonization resistance. Making colonization and disease with C-difficile more likely. If C difficile is ingested while the gut flora is suppressed, it can colonize the gut and start producing toxins. If the immune response to the toxins is high, diarrhea will not develop. Conversely, if the immune response to the toxins is low, residents can go on to develop disease. C difficile resolves when it is treated with antibiotics allowing the immune system to respond, and normal gut flora to re-establish itself. Illness associated with C difficile infection can range from mild diarrhea to potentially fatal pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, and death. The typical signs and symptoms of the disease are watery diarrhea with crampy lower abdominal pain, often accompanied by fever, nausea, and anorexia. These symptoms generally last for up to 20 days, depending on the severity of the illness. Symptoms of Pseudo-membranous colitis are generally more severe with diffuse abdominal pain, distension, and the absence of diarrhea, which is due to a paralyzed bowel or toxic megacolon. Toxic megacolon is an enlarged colon that can perforate leading to peritonitis and death. Common complications associated with C difficile associated diarrhea are dehydration, low blood potassium levels, intestinal hemorrhage, toxic megacolon, and bowel perforation in up to 10% of infected individuals. The last two are true life-threatening emergencies that require hospitalization for immediate intervention. >> Priscilla I haven't seen anything like this. First, MRSA, then the flu, and now C difficile. I don't get it. You and the other nurses are washing your hands, right? >> As best I can tell, everyone is using proper hand touching like they should.

I just learned that Miss Turner is infected too. >> Let's cut right there. >> Priscilla, let me show you this diagram to help explain why she's concerned. It shows how C Diff is spread in healthcare facilities. You can see here that the two main roots of infection are by contaminated healthcare workers hands, or by contaminated environment. >> So if the environmental services staff isn't cleaning well and using bleach to disinfect the rooms of residents with C Diff, then that could lead to other residents getting colonized or infected. >> Yes, exactly. Environmental cleaning disinfection is critical to fighting the transmission of infection. And, action. >> We need to spearhead this disinfection process.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/infection-prevention/lecture/iBtVK/6-1-epidemiology-of-c-difficile","6.1 Epidemiology of C. difficile","Preventing Clostridium difficile transmission and infection continues to represent a serious and difficult challenge in infection prevention and patient safety. In this module, you will learn about how C.difficile is spread, and best practices for preventing the spread of the germ in your facility. The learning objectives for this module are to describe the epidemiology of C.difficile. Describe how C.difficile is spread. Describe the control measures for C.difficile. Clostridium difficile is a rod shaped, spore forming bacteria that is normally found in the intestines. It causes disease by producing toxins, and is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, meaning it has to be ingested. C.difficile infection is one of the most common health care acquired infections that frequently causes life threatening diarrhea in elderly persons residing in nursing homes. In 2000, a stronger strain of the bacteria emerged, which is more virulent than previous strains. CDC estimates that there are 250,000 infections and 14,000 deaths per year. Infections and deaths due to C.difficile have increased dramatically between 2000 and 2007, with approximately half of the infections, and more than 90% of deaths occurring in people aged 65 and older. Patients in the hospital with C.difficile infection are more likely to be discharged to a long-term care facility. Recent data shows that 41.5% of patients hospitalized with C.difficile are discharged to long-term care facilities. As a result, a significant number of individuals may be carrying C.difficile on admission to a long-term care facility, and up to 20% may acquire the organism during their stay. As a consequence of the high numbers of residents already admitted to long-term care facilities with C.difficile from the hospital, and the subsequent colonization of other residents, the prevalence of C.difficile colonization in nursing home has been reported to be as high as 46%. >> Previously on Gowns and Gloves, has David's Hollywood romance with Minerva inadvertently created complications for his grandmother, Mrs. Houston? How will his love story end? And more importantly, will Mrs. Houston receive her own kind of storybook ending? Find out next on Gowns and Gloves. >> Hello, Mrs. Houston. It's your lucky day. It's the last day of your antibiotic treatment. >> How can I be happy when I'm in so much pain? My stomach is in pieces. I have the big D. >> You mean diarrhea? >> Yes, a lot and often. >> I'm so sorry, that sounds very uncomfortable. >> Yes, I just feel drained. >> Good morning, darling. [SOUND] How are you feeling today? Today is the last day of your antibiotic treatment. >> Unfortunately, Mrs. Houston is not feeling well today. She's had to make frequent trips to the bathroom yesterday and today for a bout of diarrhea. >> The big D. >> What is going on with Elaine? >> I think, you may have another infection, Mrs. Houston. Sometimes, people taking antibiotics can be affected by a bad bug called Clostridium difficile. Given the symptoms you told me about, I have a feeling this may be the case. I'll call Dr. Kennedy. You keep drinking your fluids. >> Cut. >> That is great stuff, you are all really learning. Clostridium difficile, or C.diff, is the most frequent cause of antibiotic associated diarrhea in nursing homes. >> Yeah, but is there anything my character could have done to prevent this? >> Unfortunately, C.diff is a side-effect of receiving antibiotics. It is more common in persons over the age of 65, and among long-term residents in nursing homes and other healthcare facilities. Now, the best way for residents to reduce their chances of getting C.diff is to wash hands frequently with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom, before eating, and before and after group activities. And you should also remind your nurse and others entering your room, to wash their hands before and after having contact with you, all right? Back to, action. >> Oh. I am sorry you are feeling badly. >> Thank you. [MUSIC] I'm just disappointed, because today, we were going to tell Priscilla our secret. >> What secret? >> Recipe, secret recipe. You know the brownies that you and Elaine were talking about. You both have secret family recipes, and Elaine was going to share her's with you. >> That's right. >> Oh, how sweet. I'll have to show you mine, so we can compare. It was my mother's recipe. When I was little, I never liked birthday cakes, so she used to make me birthday brownies. She said it was a secret family recipe. That's all I ever knew about my mom's family. Secret family recipe for birthday brownies. At least it's a happy memory. My mom died when I was nine. >> I know. I mean, great memory to have though. >> True, and the brownies really are fantastic. But we've got more important things at hand. We need to help you get this diarrhea cleared up. >> You mean the Big D. >> Yes, the Big D. I need to make sure that you are clean and comfortable. And I'd like to get a stool sample.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/AHCtG/course-overview","Course Overview","This program is brought to you by Emory University. [BLANK_AUDIO]. >> Hello, welcome to the first lecture in the course The Addicted Brain. My name is Dr. Michael Kuhar and I've been studying drugs and the brain for many years. A particular focus of my work has been drug addiction as it's a very interesting and important problem with its basis in brain function. Today, I'm going to give you an overview of the entire course. Obviously, we need to focus on the meaning of the word addiction. The name of the course is The Addictive Brain. What we mean by addiction is basic for us. By addiction, I refer to a repeated behavior that results in distress, personal distress, or has a negative impact on your life. An example is taking a drug such as methamphetamine repeatedly, to where you feel compelled to continue to take the drug repeatedly, even though it's having a negative impact. The negative impact could be the loss of a job or financial stresses or health problems. In many people's view, the negative impact is a key feature of addiction. Now, it's obvious that not every repetitive activity has a negative impact on your life. For example, appropriate eating is a repetitive activity that we can't do without. And it does not under normal circumstances have a negative impact. In fact, it's the opposite. It has a positive impact. There are some other things that occur with addicting behavior. For example, someone may have tried to stop behavior many times but failed. They may have tried to increase the frequency of the behavior or the dose of the drug to get the same effect. And they may find that when they've stopped the behavior or drug, they begin to feel bad, and they go into a withdrawal state, such that they go back to taking the drug to avoid the pain of withdrawal. There's other terms that we need to talk about. We're going to use the word abuse. Someone can be a drug addict or drug abuser. The word addict implies a more serious problem than the word abuser. Sometimes I'll use them fairly interchangeably because the general idea of taking drugs is the same, but there is a difference in the degree of seriousness. Also, in this course, I'm going to use the word drug to refer to an addictive substance. And the word medicine to refer to a curative and helpful substance such as an antibiotic or an antidepressant. Sometimes a substance can be both a drug and a medicine. For example, amphetamine can be used as a medicine to treat ADHD or as an abused and addictive drug. The drugs that are addicting, and now we know what we mean by the word addicting, include alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, certain prescription drugs, methamphetamine, cocaine and others. In this course, we will be talking about all of the various substances that are abused. And we'll find out how they're different, and how they're alike. Because drugs are so dangerous, to study them we need to use animals in research. Without the availability and proper use of animals we could not have learned as much as we know about drugs, nor would we have discovered the medications that we have for addicts. We've been able to understand the process of addiction, and we've been able to learn a great many things about this disorder. I'll also be talking about how drugs affect the brain. This includes the process of the brain adapting to the repeated battering of the brain by drugs. Yes, I use the word battering because the brain is truly assaulted by these substances, and I'll explain how and why that happens. I'm also going to talk about what happens at the cellular level in the brain, what happens to the individual nerve cells during the process of addiction. You'll hear the word neuroplasticity, which basically is a change in a neural pathway. And this change is the basis of some change in behaviour. Simple learning is an example of neuroplasticity, as is addiction. We all know that addiction is long-lasting. It can take people a long time to wean themselves away from taking drugs. We're going to look at the long-lasting effects of drugs through brain imaging, and through behavioral studies. An awareness of the fact that addiction is long-lasting is very critical to how we consider treating drug addiction. We'll talk about that. Another factor is vulnerability. This addresses who will be an addict. Will I be an addict? Would you be an addict? How do we figure that out? If you look at large populations of addicts and compare them to large populations of non addicts, you can see that the addicts have some personal characteristics and environmental factors that are different. We'll talk about these. Of course, if you're having trouble with drugs or other addictions, it's highly recommended that you go into treatment. While some people can walk away from drugs very easily, others don't. And we don't know why. Some people need treatment to stay away from drugs. The important thing to know is that treatment does work. Get the right treatment and it's going to help. Finally, we'll talk about government policies and the law and how it affects drug users. This is a very interesting issue and it's impact on society is not minor. In summary, this course is very broad; it covers a a lot of material. We're going to go from the molecules themselves, all the way to government policy. I know you're going to enjoy this, and learn a great deal. And I look forward to working with you.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/PhuV4/inside-vumc-the-promise-of-personalized-medicine","**Inside VUMC: The Promise of Personalized Medicine","[MUSIC] I think we live in an exciting time. I think we live in a time where our understanding of disease and disease therapies is moving away from generalizations discovered from large clinical trials and epidemiologic observations, toward an understanding of disease and therapies that's understood in the context of either a specific patient or a specific kind of patient. And that move toward personalized medicine, I think, holds the promise of maximizing benefit, and minimizing harm. If we can truly understand what this disease means in general, but what it means for this patient. And not what this therapy means in general, but what it means for this specific patient. And so I think that's exciting and that's important. And the tools to do that, both the biological tools and the molecular biology tools, and in particular, the genomics tools are really at an inflection point and they're advancing it an a phenomenal rate. So I think the reason it's important is because we have the opportunity to help people in a way that we've never been able to do before. And I think scientifically it's exciting because we're at a point where we have tools that we never had in the past. And so from the perspective of an investigator, that's an exciting combination.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/cEDUy/genetic-variability-in-drug-handling-molecules","Genetic Variability in Drug-Handling Molecules","[MUSIC] Let me talk a little bit about the history of genetics and the way in which genetics affect drug action. And I'll start with this example from work that was published about 100 years ago or more by a famous English physiologist named Garrod. Garrod studied a process called inborn errors of metabolism. Now the process of inborn errors of metabolism involves diseases that arise because things that we ordinarily have circulating in our blood are not handled correctly in the blood of affected people and those people are usually children. So for example, this is a cascade of chemical reactions that starts at the top with phenylalanine, a normal amino acid. Phenylalanine is metabolized to tyrosine and in patients who are unable to accomplish that metabolism. A disease called phenylketonuria arises, and we now screen for phenylketonuria at birth because we can prevent the consequences of accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood, which are pretty devastating if undetected. So, Garrod had this idea. That there were specific enzymes that accomplished these kinds of reactions that are shown on this cascade of reactions, and in-patients who had specific diseases, the problem was that those enzymes were not functioning correctly, and so the metabolites, the substances would accumulate upstream, causing the disease. So he published this idea, he calls it inborn errors of metabolism, around the turn of the 20th century. And, one of the things he says in the introduction to his work that's shown here is that the idiosyncrasies with regard to drugs presumably have the same kind of chemical basis. So what he was saying there was that just as endogenous substances like phenylalanine are undergoing metabolism process and if that metabolism doesn't work properly, disease can arise because of accumulation of phenylalanine, if you give somebody a drug, drugs are also metabolized. And in-patients who are unable to accomplish that metabolism of drugs can accumulate in the body to very high drug concentrations. And that accumulation can in turn cause a disease. So many people consider Garrod one of the fathers of the discipline of pharmacogenetics, the idea that genetics can effect the way in which we respond to drugs. So, he proposed that in the 19 teens, and then the 1940s and 1950s we started to see examples of that. I show you this picture of hemolytic anemia that occurs among African Americans, and what I didn't tell you when I showed you that slide is that this reaction was first recognized on a wide scale among African-American troops sent to the South Pacific during World War II. All the troops that were sent to the South Pacific were exposed, were given antimalarial drugs, because malaria is common in that part of the world. And about 10% of the African-American troops that went got this pretty severe blood reaction called hemolytic anemia. And it turns out those patients got hemolytic anemia because they have a disease called G6PD deficiency. Deficiency of a specific enzyme called G6PD, and that enzymatic deficiency doesn't really manifest itself in a very serious way in most patients until they're exposed to a drug, and then their blood cells start to fall apart. So that's one of the very first examples of an usual reaction to a drug mediated by a genetic background. And over the course of the 1940s and 50s there were specific examples. Another example is a disease called malignant hyperthermia. Occasional patients go to the operating room and get general anesthesia, and their temperatures start to rise to really dangerous levels, 108, 109, 110 degrees. And if that's not recognized and the patient isn't cooled, the patient will die. And we now recognize what the genetic defect is in malignant hyperthermia, it's a very rare disease. In the 1950s and 1960s this man, Victor McKusick at John Hopkins started to make a dictionary, a list of all the diseases that were caused by genetic defects. Both in the genetic, both with respect to changes in drug treatment, as well as other kinds of genetic diseases that we'll talk about later. And one of the focuses of his laboratory early on was the description of various kinds of genetic abnormalities or genetic variants that were silent in patients until they were exposed to drugs. And then they caused variable drug effects, sometimes spectacular adverse reactions, sometimes just variable drug effects, and one of the first reactions that he described in what he called, the dictionary he invented was called the Mendelian Inheritance in Man, or MIM. Of course, MIM has now moved to being online, so it's the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man website that you can go to and look up any gene, and see a description of the way in which variants in that gene affect human disease, human drug responses. And to close I want to just tell you a little bit about variability in CYP2D6. I'll have a whole unit to talk about this a little later. But CYP2D6, as I said before, is one of the most important drug metabolizing enzymes that we have. And we have ways of characterizing the way in which people metabolize CYP2D6 drugs. This is an experiment, I won't go into the details of how this experiment is done. But you can take a large number of subjects, a couple of hundred in this example, and then characterize their CYP2D6 activity. It's very simple. You give them a drug that's metabolized by the enzyme, and then you determine the amount of drug and the amount of metabolite that appears in the urine. If there's lots of metabolite and very little drug, they have high activity of the enzyme. If there's lots of drug and very little metabolite, they have very low activity of the enzyme. And then you can graph that in the way that's shown here. And what you can see is two pretty clear, distinct populations. There's one population that's in black that has almost no activity, that's on the side. And then, one population in blue that has a fair amount of activity, it's still very variable. Some of them have lots of activity and some of them have a little less activity, but still have enzyme. So, that's the way in which drug metabolism variability was described in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s. But now with the advent of understanding the structure of the CYP2D6 gene, and the way in which variants in that gene affect it's function, we understand what it is that causes this distribution. So, what we now know is that people who are poor metabolizers, that's 5 to 10% of Caucasians, and 5 to 10% of African subjects, a little less in Asia. Those people are absolutely deficient in s CYP2D6 activity because they have loss of function variants in both copies of the gene. Remember, there's a maternal copy and a paternal copy, they have variants in both copies. And those variants can be the same, they can be homozygous, or those variants can be different, that's called compound heterozygous. The people who have normal activity either have one deficient copy of the enzyme, or have no deficient copies of the enzyme. And those cartoons are shown in the middle there. Now, you notice that over towards the other side are people who have lots and lots and lots of activity. This is a log scale, so they have lots and lots of activity. And we now understand that those people have more than one functional copy of the gene. The record seems to be somewhere in the teens. 13 copies of the gene, each one of which produces functional protein in the liver, so that those patients, when they're given a drug metabolized by CYP2D6 chew it up very, very, very, very quickly. The drug concentrations are very rarely high at all. So this is the genetic basis for variability in CYP2D6 activity. It turns out that there are hundreds of variants of CYP2D6 that can produce this variability that you see here. Some of them are common. And some of them are very, very rare. The frequency of the duplications that you see in green here, very strikingly by ancestry. So they're quite common in Saudi Arabia, in Eritrea, in Ethiopia. Rarer in other parts of the world, but certainly well described. So we have here the molecular basis and the genetic basis for variability in the function of one important drug metabolizing enzyme. We understand that there's variability by ancestry because some of the variants are more common in some ancestries than other. And we understand that there's going to be a problem if we're going to be using genetics to assign what we think somebody would be at to assigned. We understand that there's going to be a problem in using genetics to assign somebody to the form of metabolizer, extensive metabolizer, or ultra rapid metabolizer group because there's so many different variants that we have to take into account. This is one example. Each one of the drug metabolizing enzymes, each one of the transporter molecules, and each one of the drug targets that were talked about before is encoded by a gene, and each one of them has variants. And each one of those variants may effect the way in which drugs produce their actions in patients that holds for beneficial actions. It holds for adverse drug reactions. And so, the whole discipline of pharmacogenetics will be the subject of several modules later to expand on this kind of thing. [SOUND] >> [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/x7KzN/drug-metabolism-transport","Drug Metabolism & Transport","[MUSIC] Last time, I presented a framework for thinking about how to analyze variability and drug action, and framework includes the processes of absorption, metabolism, excretion, distribution, and interaction of the drug with its molecular target or targets to produce whole organ effects. And I eluded to the idea that genetics can affect all of those processes, and so today I'm going to talk a little bit more about how that genetic process works. Let me start by showing you that drug metabolism is more complicated than just a drug arriving in the liver and being metabolized. Drugs are metabolized by specific enzymes in the liver, and each drug has its own set of enzyme or enzymes that accomplish its metabolism to other drug metabolites, usually more hydrophilic than the parent drug that allows the drug to be excreted in the kidney and the bile. Drug metabolism is traditionally divided into two parts, Phase I and Phase II. Phase I drug metabolism is the process of drug oxidation. Hydroxylation, those processes, and that is accomplished usually by members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. We abbreviate that CYP. So what you see here are many many members of the CYP superfamily, such as CYP2D6. We call that CYP2D6, or CYP3A4, or CYP2C9, or CYP2C19, and that's the terminology I'm going to use. Each one of those enzymes metabolizes one or more drugs that are important for human therapeutics. The space that they occupy on the pie chart is proportional to the number of drugs that we use in clinical practice that that particular enzyme system metabolizes. So by far the most important enzyme, metabolizing drugs that we use in human therapeutics is the CYP 3A4, 3A5, 3A7 family. Those are three separate enzymes, all of which accomplish the same kind of drug metabolism. The next most important is CYP2D6 in yellow. CYP2D6 actually occupies a tiny proportion of liver enzyme, but it's very important as a drug metabolizing enzyme. So that's why it occupies such a large proportion of the pie. The other part of the pie is phase II metabolism. Phase II metabolism doesn't change the structure of the drug, it attaches new molecules to the drug. And those molecules are acetyl groups, methyl groups, lukeronal groups or sulfonyl groups, and so the enzymes that accomplish that are called transferases. They are acetyl transferases, you see NAT1 and NAT2 at the top of the pie chart. They're glucuronyl transferases, UGTs that occupy a large proportion of the pie chart, the self anneal transferases in pink. So those are the enzymes that accomplish drug metabolism, and the important point in this is that each one of these has genetic variants in the gene that encodes the particular enzyme that you're looking at. So there are important variants in CYP3A4, in CYP2D6, in UGT1A1, in CYP2C9, and each one of those may be important for variable drug metabolism. And that in turn can effect response to the drug. So that's one of the ways in which genetics affects drug responses. Let me introduce another set of molecules that can also affect the way the body handles drugs. Let me introduce them to you by showing a clinical case. This is a set of electrocardiograms recorded from the man who was transferred to our hospital from an outside hospital, because he had recurrent ventricular tachycardia. That's that very fast, disorganized rhythm on the second, third, and fourth panels here. So he had a history of what we call non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe heart disease, and his medications included ramipril, an ACE inhibitor, Simvastatin, a lipid lowering drug, Metoprolol, a beta blocker, Digoxin, a drug to increase cardiac contractility, spironolactone, a diuretic drug, and because of his abnormal rhythms, he had also been treated with a drug called amiodarone, and that had been given intravenously. He was having more and more abnormal rhythms, and we didn't understand why, until someone thought to measure the amount of digoxin in his blood and he had very, very high digoxin concentration 5.5. Anything above two is toxicity and we like to have concentrations around one in most patients who receive the drug. So that is probably the mechanism of this abnormal rhythm, but what is it that made his digoxin level get so high? So let me take a little digression and tell you a little bit about art. This is one of the last paintings that Vincent Van Gogh painted and it's a portrait of his doctor, Doctor Gachet. This painting hangs in a, In a museum of modern art in Paris. And one of the interesting things about this painting is this flower here. The flower, which is shown in the next slide, is actually picture of the flower foxglove. Foxglove is the flower from which Digoxin is actually extracted. So when people develop very high digoxin concentrations, they have two very serious effects. One is on the heart, abnormal heart rhythms. The other one is that their thought processes become disturbed and their vision becomes disturbed. And classically, the visual disturbance is yellow halos around lights. And so, there are people who think the doctor Gachet actually gave Vincent van Gogh far too much digoxin, and that's why Starry Night, which you see on this picture, looks the way it does. He was chronically digoxin intoxicated. So let me come back to the patient that I discussed with you. That patient has very high drug concentrations in their blood and that, presumably, accounted for the toxicity. When people think about that they say, well, the drugs that he was getting must have in some way interfered with the way Digoxin is metabolized. Digoxin is one of those drug that the body just doesn't metabolize. You absorb it, it hangs around in the blood, and then it's excreted in the bile in the kidneys. So it's not metabolized, it's excreted unchanged. And it turns out that the administration of a long list of drugs including amiodarone, will interfere with that excretion process. And it turns out that we now understand the digoxin is moved from one side of the cell membrane to another by a process called drug transport. And there's a specific molecule which we call p-glycoprotein that actually accomplishes that transport. Amiodarone and many other interfering drugs interfere with the way p-glycoprotein works. Digoxin can't be excreted. The concentrations get high. The patient develops abnormal heart rhythms. So that's the way that patient worked, probably a drug interaction. So let me tell you a little bit more about these drug transport molecules. This is a picture of what goes on at the intestinal lumen in the kidney cells. In the liver cells, hepatocytes, and in the capillaries of the blood brain barrier. And at each position, you see a cell and multiple little pieces of alphabet soup. Each one of those represents a gene, and each gene encodes a drug transporter. Some of those drug transporters function by taking a drug up out of the circulation and moving it into a cell. Some of those drug transporters function by taking a drug that's inside a cell and squirting it back out again, back out into the circulation, or back out into the bile, or back out into the kidney lumen into the urine. So that's the way drug transporters work. The little black squares highlight the letters MDR1. MDR1 is the gene that encodes P-glycoprotein, that very important transport molecule for digoxen. And you can see that P glycoprotein is expressed in the intestine, in the liver, in the kidney, and in the capillaries near the brain. And in each one of those places interfering with P-glycoprotein function will change drug concentration. So let me give you two examples of how P-glycoprotein function works to change the amount of drug delivered to important sites in the body. This is the first example, and this is how P-glycoprotein works to change the amount of drug that's ordinarily delivered into the brain. The picture that you see is a capillary that profuses brain cells. And what happens is that drugs are taken up into the capillaries and then transported into the brain cells. And one of the mechanisms that the brain has of defending itself against drugs is normal P-glycoprotein function. So what happens is a drug will get into the capillary cell and then P-glycoprotein will squirt that drug right back out into the capillary, limiting the amount of drug that actually penetrates into the brain. You see that on the top panel. There's a picture of drug concentrations versus time, and there's high concentration plasma and very, very low concentration in brain, in green. Now, if you give a drug that interferes with P-glycoprotein function, or P-glycoprotein is in some way not quite normal say through genetic variance, then P-glycoprotein won't accomplish that squirting out function properly, and the amount of drug that gets into the brain is much, much higher. You could see that in the over panel where the amount in plasma is about the same, but the amount in brain is much higher, and that's why the brain on the bottom is dark green and the brain on the top is only light green, because the concentrations are much higher in the lower example than they are in the higher example. Another example that is very, very common, quite complicated, is what goes on when we absorb drugs. So there are many, many drugs that are handled by the body in the following fashion: the drug is administered orally, and enters the intestinal lumen. The first thing that it sees is an intestinal cell, that's this group of three cells down at the bottom of the slide. The drug is transported into the intestinal cell where one of two or three things can happen to it. One is that it can be transported out the other side through a second drug transport system. It can be transported back into the intestinal lumen by P-glycoprotein shown in blue here. Or it can in fact be metabolized in the intestinal cell, and once it's metabolized, the metabolites can then be transported back into the lumen, transported out the other end of the intestinal cell. Once drugs or the metabolites get out the other end of the intestinal cell, they enter the portal circulation. The portal circulation perfuses the liver, and they enter the liver cell. So again, they can get taken up Into the liver cells by active transport molecules and then one of two things can happen: they can exit the liver cell or they can be transported to the bile and of course the third thing that the liver accomplishes is drug metabolism. So now we have drugs and metabolites being transported Into the lumen, into the enterocyte, the intestinal cell, into the hepatocyte, the liver cell, and being excreted into the bile or making it into the systemic circulation. So this illustrates the importance of p-glycoprotein as a mechanism for drug excretion. And it also illustrates the fact that of the molecules that we take by mouth, not 100% of them arrive into the systemic circulation. For some drugs only a very, very small proportion managed to escape this protective mechanism that the body has and the body will actually metabolize or excrete a large proportion of drug. For other drugs, these process are not very important and almost all of the drug that we give by mouth arrives in the system of circulation. So p-glycoprotein is one of those very important drug transport molecules, whose function is to change the amount of drug delivered into the systemic circulation, the amount of drug delivered into cells, the amount of drug delivered into bile, into urine, and other important sites of action.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/spi4r/variability-in-drug-therapy","Variability in Drug Therapy","[MUSIC] Well, this is how I closed the last time. Talking about the idea that what we would like to do is be able to predict response to a drug treatment in a particular patient. So let me talk a little bit about the reasons that drugs vary in their effects. Age, sex, and ancestry are very important. We're beginning to appreciate more and more how important those factors are. We've always known that older people respond differently than younger people. Kids respond differently than adults, but women respond differently than men. We're understanding that more and more, and part of that has to do with body size, but part of it has to do with specific gender-specific factors. And we do see variability by ancestry from a number of drugs, and we'll come back to that during the specific examples over the next several modules. Another question I ask myself is, was the diagnosis right? Of course, if the diagnosis was wrong, then the drug we're using to treat whatever diagnosis we have won't be highly effective. It's also important to know whether the disease being treated or some other disease affects how the drug works. So the way that might work is that we test drugs in normal volunteers, and they might have a specific effect. But then when you try them in patients, the patient has a disease that's being treated, and the drug effect will be completely different. We see that sometimes particularly with drugs used to treat psychiatric disease, for example, where the effects can be quite different in patients, compared to normal volunteers where drugs are first tested. We always worry about drug interactions. Drug interactions are something we worry about so much that they ought to be a subject of an entire course by themselves. And I'll allude to drug interactions intermittently during this talk and subsequent talks. We worry a lot about the environment that people are exposed to. One very important component of the environment is diet. There are drugs where we have to be very, very careful about controlling patient's diet, because certain things in the diet can actually affect the way the drug works, and I'll give examples in later talks. Another really important question that we don't pay much attention to in clinical medicine but turns out to be a huge problem when we worry about variable drug effects is, is the patient actually taking their drug? Some estimates say that up to half of the patients who are treated for common conditions, common chronic conditions like high blood pressure may not take the drug as often as they should, and up to a quarter of those patients may never take drugs at all, even though they come to the office and say they're taking the drug. Then, of course, a patient in the hospital, we always have to ask the question, did the patient actually get the drug that was prescribed? We ask that question on the outpatient side as well, but in inpatients, it's a particular problem, and systems are now in place in many hospitals to prevent patients from receiving the wrong drug. And then, of course, there are genetic factors that I'm going to talk about in this particular talk and subsequent talks that influence the way in which people respond to drugs, and particularly some of the risk for serious adverse drug reactions. This is a graph from a study that looked at the effect of a commonly used lipid lowering drug symvastatin in almost 1,000 patients who were Caucasian or African American. And what you can see is that the drug did exactly what we expect it do. That is it dramatically lowered LDL cholesterol. And the average was a 41% decrease in LDL cholesterol after six weeks of treatment with symvastatin 40 miligrams a day. But the important thing is that there are some patients who have absolutely no response, you can see them up at zero up here. And there are some patients who have a really dramatic response that minus 80%, so their LDL cholesterols go down an enormous amount. Most patients are in the middle. Most patients are somewhere around 41%, between say 30% and 50%. But there are always outliers, and whenever we graph the effects of a drug in this way, we always see the variability. And so a question we always asked is what is it that puts somebody in one tail of this distribution, the other tail of this distribution, or in the middle? And I have to acknowledge that these data are data that came from something called the Pharmacogenomics Research Network, a large network of investigators of which we're a part, that look at variable drug effects and the genetics around that, so kudos to this group. When we look at response rates to drug therapy in general, they're not 100%. So if you're treating common chronic conditions like high blood pressure, depression, cancer, diabetes, schizophrenia, abnormal heart rhythms, the response rates to the initial treatment being used are always less than 100%. And sometimes they're really depressingly low like 30% or 50% [COUGH] this slide shows examples of that. And that's a common problem across medicine. What we often do is we say, well, the first drug didn't work, let's try another drug. Or if the first drug didn't work, let's add another drug on. But wouldn't it be nice to understand what it is about the first drug that makes some people respond, and some people not respond. ANd that's one of the hopes of personalizing therapy. So again, the problem in choosing a drug for a patient is we always want to make sure that we anticipate that the drug will produce greater benefit than it does risk, and especially serious risk. So what kinds of risks do we anticipate when we give a drug to a patient? Risks really fall into, in my mind, three or four different categories. One is the problem that if we give a drug whose mechanism of action we understand, sometimes patients display excess effect. So for example, if we're giving a blood thinning drug like aspirin, some patients will display excess blood thinning, and the problem will be bleeding. That's a predictable side effect. If you're treating a patient with high blood pressure and you give an antihypertensive drug, some patients will display very, very low blood pressures, that's a predicted drug effect. We call that an on-target effect. Then there are other effects that we think are off-target. That is, we give a drug for high blood pressure, and the patient develops a skin rash, or the patient develops angioedema, that's off-target, that's not what we expect. But that's still a side effect, pretty easy to relate that side effect to the administration of the drug. You give the drug, and then two days later, somebody has a skin rash, or somebody has a swollen tongue. It's pretty obvious that the drug caused that. Another kind of side effect is that if you're treating a group of patients who are at high risk for what we call a background event. So suppose you're treating a group of large patients who have a heart disease, you expect some of those patients over time to develop heart attacks. That's what happens in the absence of a drug or the presence of a drug. If you administer a drug to that group of patients and the incidence of heart attacks goes up a little bit, it sometimes becomes very, very difficult to prove that the drug caused that increase in heart attacks. A great example is the example of Vioxx or Rofecoxib, a drug that was developed to reduce inflammation that causes an increase risk of heart attack, and it took a lot of studies and large numbers of patients to understand that risks and to quantify that risk, and eventually the drug was withdrawn from the market. I think, actually, the commonest side effect of drugs is that sometimes the drug just doesn't work the way it should. That relates back to this slide here, and it relates back to the idea that drugs are variably effective. So one way of thinking about that is the commonest side effect of a drug is that the drug doesn't do what it's supposed to do. So let me talk a little bit about how drugs work. This is not intended to be a detailed discussion of pharmacology, but this is one example of a molecular mechanism that is targeted by many commonly used drugs. This is a cartoon showing the mechanism of action of the group of molecules called G-protein-coupled receptors. The receptor is this molecule that goes across this yellow band, the yellow band is the cell membrane. The receptor is coupled to those G-proteins that are shown below the cell membrane. And what happens is a hormone comes along, couples to the receptor, changes the function of the receptor so that it binds the G-protein, and then as the G-protein is bound, it emits a signal to tell the cell to change its function. So a specific example might be adrenaline, the hormone adrenaline produces its effects by interacting with the specific receptor called the beta adrenergic receptors and producing G-protein-coupled chemical reactions. So that happens in a heart cell, it will increase heart rate. The hormone could be histamine. When histamine reacts with its receptor in the stomach, the net result is the stomach cell produces stomach acid. So those are what we call normal hormonal functions, but sometimes it's important to be able to interfere with those hormonal functions to treat disease. So one very common set of molecular targets for drug action are G-protein-coupled receptors, and the way that works is shown here. We have a drug, the little red blob, that interacts with the receptor. By interacting with the receptor, it prevents the hormone from interacting with the receptor, and then nothing happens downstream. The drug remains bound. The G-protein doesn't bind to the receptor, and the cellular function doesn't happen. So we have drugs that are very commonly used for high blood pressure, for asthma, for allergy, to treat excess stomach acid, to treat depression, and many, many other diseases, all of which interact with specific G-protein-coupled receptors. We have hundreds of G-protein-coupled receptors in our bodies in various parts, and this is a common target. G-protein-coupled receptors are among the commonest targets that drugs that we have now interact with. Other targets are shown on this slide, and include enzymes and other kinds of molecules. Each one of those molecules is encoded by a specific gene, and that's where we start to see the interaction between what goes on in our genome and how we might respond to drugs. So let me talk a little bit about what it is that makes for variable drug actions in a normal human person. We give a dose of a drug, and that drug gets into the plasma somehow. Usually, we give a dose of a drug orally, and it arrives in plasma by the process of absorption. There are other routes, we can give a drug directly into the bloodstream. We can give it intramuscularly. There are many other routes, but somehow the drug arrives in plasma. And then once it's in plasma, it can be distributed to peripheral tissues through a process called distribution. And it can also, from the plasma, be eliminated. And the elimination process is a process of drug metabolism followed by excretion of the drug or the metabolite, usually through the kidneys or the bile in the liver. Understanding this kind of concept makes us smarter in terms of understanding variability and drug actions. So one question we would ask when we see a framework like this, is did the patient actually take the medicine, and did that patient actually get the medicine that was prescribed at the right time and at the right dose? Obviously, if they didn't, then it won't appear in plasma, it won't be eliminated, it won't be distributed to peripheral tissues. And is the patient taking a drug that might interfere with the processes of metabolism, excretion, absorption, or distribution, and there are well-described drug interactions for many, many drugs that interfere with those processes. So we always have to think about drug interactions as a source of variability in drug levels and in drug effects. And then, of course, the problem with genetic variants and their very specific molecules, which I'll talk about later that control metabolism and excretion and absorption and distribution. Those genetic variants can have really huge effects on the amount of drug that is present in the body and therefore, the amount of drug effect that we see. So that's one part of variable drug actions, we call that pharmacokinetics, that's this particular cartoon. Now, once a drug gets into plasma, it starts to think about where it's going to interact with its molecular target. Its molecular target could be a protein that's floating around in plasma. It could be a protein that is on a cell membrane like a G-protein-coupled receptor. It could be a protein that's inside a cell. So somehow or other, a drug has to access its molecular site of action to produce its beneficial effect, and of course, it accesses a molecular site of action to produce side effects as well. Every drug interacts with one or more targets to produce its beneficial or adverse effects. So once a drug produces its interaction with its molecular target at its cellular site of action, that changes the way an organ functions. That changes the way the heart or the liver or the kidney or the brain functions, and that in turn produces the beneficial or adverse effects that we see with drugs. So again, we ask ourselves the question, what is it that might produce variability in this process? One process that produces variability is whether the patient is taking a potentially interacting drug, and drugs again can interact with this process at many sites. For example, drugs can interfere with the way in which a drug finds its molecular site of action, or it can interfere with the way in which it binds to its molecular site of action. Was the diagnosis right? I talked about that before. Is the disease being treated the correct one, does the patient have some other disease that changes the way in which the drug will act in that particular patient? And then, of course, genetic variants. Genetic variants in the molecular target could change the way in which the drug binds to its molecular target. Genetic variants, in the way in which an organ functions, can change the way in which the drug produces its effect at the whole organ level. And then finally, there is a very poorly understood but very, very well recognized contributor to variability of drug action, and that's the placebo effect. And there's no question that you give patients drugs, and you tell them that they're going to work for their blood pressure or for their depression, those drugs could be sugar pills, and some proportion of patients will have a beneficial response. We don't understand that very well, but that's another major contributor to variability in drug action. So next time, we're going to talk a little bit more about the genetic variants, and start to understand what it is about genetic variants that can produce variable drug effects. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/1x9oi/introduction-to-drug-therapy-and-general-mechanisms-underlying-variability-in","Introduction to Drug Therapy and General Mechanisms Underlying Variability in Drug Responses","[MUSIC] Drugs are an incredibly important part of the whole concept of personalized medicine. And the problem with drugs is that every time we give a drug to a patient, we see variable responses. And every time we give a drug to a group of patients, we see variable responses. So for the next couple of talks I'm going to talk about the mechanisms underlying that variability. Let me start with a couple of statistics that might be of interest. And the statistics are around how much countries spend on healthcare and how much of that expenditure is devoted to drug costs. These are data from the World Health Organization and they show the total expenditure on health as a percent of gross domestic product for a range of countries that are shown on the bottom. From Afghanistan all the way through the United States. This is a statistic in which the United States is the undisputed world leader. And that's not a very comfortable place to be so we have to do something about thinking about healthcare costs in this country. And that's something for a different talk at a different time. These are statistics that outline the way in which we spend money on healthcare. In the year 2012 we spent almost $3 trillion, 300,000 billion dollars, on healthcare. Most of that goes to hospital care, the big green part of the pie chart, and to professional expense is the gray part. But you'll see the drugs occupy about 10% of the entire healthcare expenditure, that's $261 million a year. So one of the hopes of personalized medicine is that by using drugs in a more efficient way, by using the right drug for the right patient, the right dose of the right drug for the right patient at the right time, we can actually do something to at least stop these costs from growing, if not make them smaller. Now every time a healthcare provider prescribes a drug, the fundamental question that they have to ask themselves is whether the benefit that they're going to see from the drug exceeds the risk. Every drug has risks and every drug, presumably, has benefits because we would never be using them otherwise. So what we want is a drug where the benefit outweighs the risk. So let me tell you a little bit about how we go about assessing risk versus benefit. The traditional way, which is the way that I'm going to outline, is to do what we call a randomized trial. So we take a large group of patients, and you can see here there are both men and women. We would like them all ages that might be exposed to the drug, from all ancestries that might be exposed to the drug. And we divide them using a flip of a coin into two halves. And one group will get the drug that we're interested in, and the other will get what we call a comparator treatment. Now for some conditions, the comparator treatment might be a sugar pill, a placebo. For other treatments the comparator pill, or the comparative treatment, will be a standard treatment. So we might be comparing a new treatment compared to an old treatment. We might be comparing a high dose of a treatment to a low dose of a treatment. We might be comparing a new drug to an old drug. We might be comparing a new drug to placebo. So that what we do is we randomized patients to receive treatment A or treatment B. And then we assess the effect of the drug over time. So in this example, lots of patients in treatment A had a cure of whatever it is we were treating, and very few patients in treatment B. And when we look at side effects, lots of patients in treatment B had side effects. Very few patients in treatment A had side effects. So if you're a healthcare provider and you know these data, you would say, well, it's pretty straightforward. Patients, my patients, should get treatment A not treatment B. Now unfortunately, that's not the way the world really works. And for most drugs and most of these kinds of trials, the results are a little more subtle. So let me give you an example of how the results can be a lot more subtle than the example I gave you here that raise all kinds of questions about how you're going to choose which treatment to give a patient. So here's another trial, and now we're counting patients who were cured, and it's roughly the same number in each group. I think there's a few more in treatment A than treatment B. And then what we didn't talk about before was that there will be a chunk of patients in each group who have just have no effect. You give them the drug and whatever it is you're treating just doesn't change. Which drug would you rather take? Well let me go back and show you these pictures again. And based on this, looks like treatment A is a little bit better than treatment B. But that's not the real way the world works because we haven't counted side effects yet. So let's look at side effects. And again, it looks like treatment B has a lot more side effects than treatment A, so I'm still leaning towards treatment A. But then there's this problem that some drugs produce really serious side effects, side effects that could kill you. Now when you look at the whole thing you ask yourself, which treatment would you rather have? Now let's add it up. If you have hay fever, what you want is a drug that has no risk of causing these severe side effects. None at all. So you might choose treatment B. Your chances of having your hay fever treated effectively are smaller. But your chances of dying during treatment are much lower. On the other hand, if you have advanced cancer, you go for treatment A even though there are severe side effects. In fact, many cancer therapies have this problem that they have very, very high instances of side effects, and that's the price you pay for an effective drug. So that's one of the problems that we would like to solve in drug treatment. So this illustrates the problem that it's not sometimes not so simple to figure out whether a drug is going to be effective or not. So which drug would you rather take? I think the answer probably depends on what the disease is and what the particular patient feels they're willing to tolerate in terms of risks for trivial side effects, and risk for serious side effects. So let me talk a little bit about these rare, serious side effects. We call them adverse drug effects because they are one of the things that go into thinking about how to choose drugs among patients. I'm going to give you a couple of examples just to show you the kinds of problems that we run into. They're all rare, but they're so spectacular when they occur that physicians really worry about them a lot. So here is one. There's a class of drugs called ACE inhibitors, used very commonly in the treatment of high blood pressure. And rarely patients will get, what we call, Angioedema. Angioedema means swelling of the tongue and the throat, and that can be fatal. It usually occurs when the patients start the drug, but can occasionally occur during long term treatment. And this patient happens to be an African American, as you can see, and this particular adverse drug effect occurs more commonly in African Americans. My own bias is that when I hear that some drug side effect occurs more often in a certain ancestry compared to another, that is code for me that there's probably genetics at work here. So they're genetic variants that somehow make people more susceptible to this kind of side effect and those variants are commoner in certain ancestral groups. So there is an example. Here's another example that's also almost exclusively confined to African Americans. This is an example of what we call hemolytic anemia. The red blood cells are falling apart after exposure to an anti-malarial drug, and I'll come back to this because this has particular historical interest when we think about rare, adverse drug effects. Here's another example very dear to my heart, because I spent a lot of time studying mechanisms of heart rhythms and abnormal heart rhythms, particularly those provoked by drugs. So this is a picture of an electrocardiogram from a patient who has a near fatal abnormal heart rhythm because of exposure to a drug. And there's lots of things I could say about that, and in some of the modules that will come a later, we're going to talk a little bit about these kinds of abnormal rhythms and how genetics might help us predict who's at risk. This is a picture of a brain from an autopsy of a patient who has suffered a fatal intracerebral hemorrhage, so bleeding into the brain. You can see the intracerebral hemorrhage right there. This can happen as a consequence of many blood thinning drugs. And we'll come back to that as well. This is a photo micrograph of muscles that have developed severe inflammation after exposure to statin drugs. Statin drugs are among the most widely used drugs in the Western world because they do such an effective job of lowering LDL cholesterol, bad cholesterol, and reducing the incidence of heart attacks and other kinds of vascular events. Very occasional patients will have muscle pains when they start statins, and very very rarely people will have severe inflammation of their muscles that can be fatal. So this is something people worry about a lot, it's pretty rare, but it certainly changes the way in which you think about using statins. And then one of the commonest things that drugs can do is cause skin rashes. And this is a picture of a patient with a skin rash. That can be from many, many drugs. Sometimes skin rashes are just a little nuisance, and they stop when you stop the drug. Sometimes they can lead to, actually, loss of skin, and the patient will present as though they have a severe burn. And those reactions are very, very rare, but they can also be fatal. And we'll touch on some of those in later talks. So each one of those reactions is really, really rare. A practicing doctor or a medical practice in general will see those once a year, once every couple of years, some doctors will go through their entire careers using those drugs and never see anything at all. And yet, when you add up all the numbers from across the country, adverse drug reactions, like the ones I've just shown you and others, are a really really important cause of hospital admissions, of bad events occurring in hospitalization, and death. There's one estimate from a famous 1994 paper that said there were over 100,000 deaths from adverse drug effects in the United States, making this the fourth to the sixth leading cause of death in the country. So that prompted a lot of head scratching among medical leadership and a very famous report called To Err is Human, issued by the The National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine, that outlined the problem made some recommendations for change. And unfortunately, the latest data we have, at least from the State of North Carolina, and it looks like that's going to be generalizable across the country, is that this problem persists. So, we don't have a good handle on how to get around these rare adverse events. They're rare in a practice, but they're common across the country. So 100,000 deaths is something like 300 a day. So this is a real national health crisis in some ways. Because if you imagined that one or two Seven Forty Sevens crashed or ran into each other on the runway of a major airport once a day in the country, the country would be up in arms. Because that's 300 to 500 people dying every day in those kinds of airplane accidents. But because these are scattered over the country and they're really rare, people don't really pay much attention. But that's the scope of the problem. So the real problem that we're facing is this variability in drug effects. And I think the problem is not to think about what happens in a large population of patients who are randomized to treatment A or treatment B, that's the way we make decisions in the medical world. But if I were a patient, or if I'm a doctor treating a patient, my question is not on average is treatment A better than treatment B, but for that patient, the one who's circled, what is their response going to be. And there is a great hope that personalizing treatment through genetics or other kinds of mechanisms will improve the problem of variable drug responses. [MUSIC] [SOUND]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/O0cYc/data-analysis-part-ii-what-is-a-good-test","Data Analysis, Part II: What is a Good Test?","[MUSIC] This module deals with ways in which we have to evaluate how good new tests are. So what I mean by that is we might have a test, say a test for breast cancer, or a test for heart failure. That is the gold standard, what we would call the Reference test. And then we have a new test. The New test might be the same test as the old test, but adding genetic information. It could be an entirely new blood test. And we would want to know, does the new test outperform the old test? Does a chest x-ray for diagnosis of heart failure, which is the standard is their added value to measuring Serum BNP. So we would want to do a test like that. If we wanted to have a prediction of who in the population was going to have a heart attack in the next ten years, there are clinical predictors of that. This is a pretty standard problem in Cardiology and a standard problem in other areas of medicine using clinical factors to predict the development of disease. How about if you add genetics to those clinical predictors? Do you do better? And this is the way in which we evaluate those kinds of added value tests in Clinical Medicine and in Personalized Medicine. So the reference test and the new test will have both True positives and True negatives. True positives are tests where the new test is positive and the reference test is positive, the gold standard. And True negatives where they're both negative. The problem is that a new test may not be the same as the reference test, because the new test might have a false positive rate. We call that a Type I error. And we generally don't want that to be more than 0.05 in statistical terms. But a new test will have a false positive rate determined by this two by two table. The new test will also have a false negative rate. That is, it will fail to detect cases that the gold standard or reference test to text. So we have a number of ways in which we would evaluate a new test compare to an old test. And these are pretty standard definitions that I'd just put on them this in subsequent slides. One is Sensitivity, that's the true positives divided by the true positives plus the false negatives. In other words adding up the true positives and the false negatives below them in the column, that's the total. And the true positive is the numerator, that's the sensitivity. The Specificity is the same thing but with the other column. The true negative rate divided by true negative plus false positive. Now positive predicted value looks across the table instead of down the columns. True positive rate divided by true positive plus false positive is the positive predictive value. And the negative predictive value is a true negative divided by the true negative plus the false negative. Again, across the rows rather than down the columns, in this particular table. So here is an example. We have a test that has been evaluated in 750 patients. The gold standard says, makes a positive test in 700 of those 750, and a negative test in 50. So we already know that the gold standard is being applied. The population in which this test is being applied is a population that has a lot of this disease, whatever it is that we're studying. because it's very prevalent, the positive value 700 out of 750. The new test finds a positive test 640 times and a negative test 110 times. So the new test has a sensitivity of 600 out of 700, or 85%. Does a pretty good job of finding them, but a specificity of 10 out of 50 or 20%. So, a new test is not very specific. If the new test says the disease is there, the disease might or might not be there. The positive predictive value of the new test is very good, 95% and the negative predictive value, not so good, 10 out of 110 or 9%. Now there's a relationship between the probability that a test will find true positives and a probability of finding false positives depending on the underlying disease frequencies and the underlying population structure. So if we have a new test and we plot the relationship between the probability of finding false positives and the probability of finding true positives, that's what we call a Receiver Operating Curve. A test that is totally like a coin flip is shown on the diagonal line on this plot. So if you have a test where the relationship between one minus specificity versus sensitivity is a straight line like that, the test is no better than flipping a coin. And the area under the curve is the way to measure that. And we measure the area under the curve. The area of the entire plot is 1.0, so the area under this curve is 0.5. That's the area below the diagonal line on this side. Here is a great test. Here's a test where the area under the curve is almost a 100%. We almost never see this but a really, really great test would have an AUC or Area Under the Curve of 0.95. In this particular ROC or Receiver Operating Curve analysis. Here's a more likely result. So we have a test where we have, for example evaluated the impact of adding genetic variation to clinical variation. And we now have a test that has a receiver operating curve with an area under the curve of 0.7. So it's better than flipping a coin and how do you put that into context? Well one way to thinking about it is that if you want to find 80% true positives, the really great test will do that at a very, very low price. You won't find very many false negatives. The not so good test you'll get to 80% sensitivity, but the price you pay is a much higher chance of false positives, one minus Specificity. And it's pretty common in this kind of testing to have AUCs of 0.7, 0.7 is pretty good, 0.8, 0.9 are very good and 0.95 is really so good that you have either a new test or you have a mistake in the experiment. One of those two things that happens. So I'm going to close this particular module by just giving you an example of an old test, a reference test, and a new test. And asking you to calculate the sensitivity, the specificity, the positive predictive value, and the negative predictive value for these 800 patients who have been evaluated in this particular way. >> [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/tcb3e/drugs-are-multifunctional","Drugs are Multifunctional","In today's video, I would like to accomplish two things. One, I want to discuss the fact that drugs are multifunctional. I want to explain how a single drug can have many different effects. The second things is that I'd like to briefly review everything that we've done this past week. So, first let's take a look at why drugs are multifunctional. When I say that drugs are multifunctional I mean that the single drug can do many things by acting at many different molecular sites or receptors. This is important because both therapeutic medicines and addicting drugs have many effects. Addicting drugs can be benign in some ways and very toxic in others. We'll see that later in this course in more detail. To quickly review something that we've already talked about, drugs act at receptors and again, receptors are the molecular sites that the drug must bind with, to exert its action. The receptor's like a button. The drug has to push the button for it to have an effect. If the drug can't get to its receptor, it won't have any effect, even if it's close by the receptor. The shape of the drug molecule must be complementary to the shape of the receptor molecule. A common analogy is that they have to fit together like a key in a lock. Only when the lock and key are joined together can they produce an effect, which is like an open door. For a drug to have an effect, it must join together with its receptor. Because drug molecules have different shapes when viewed from different angles and sides, they can fit into different receptors. Let's take a look at an example. This is the chemical structure of THC, an active ingredient to Marijuana. Every drug has a specific shape, and THC is a fairly complex molecule that will look slightly different when you're looking at it from the upper right, or if you view, if you're viewing it from the lower left. This illustration shows how THC could bind to two different receptors. One receptor could have a shape that fits perfectly the right side of the THC molecule. Whereas another receptor could have a shape that perfectly fits the lower-left side of the THC molecule. Because of this idea, THC molecules could fit into more than one molecular site, more than one receptor and produce multiple effects in different places. Because of this multifunctionality, a single drug can do many things. For example, cocaine can reduce bleeding, produce euphoria, cause addiction and act as a local anesthetic. Again, this happens because drug dis, drug receptors are widely distributed and because a single drug can act at many different receptors. We will see in later lectures how important the multifunctionality of drugs can be. Before I wrap up this week's lectures, I would like to briefly review the important topics we've covered this week. The first thing to mention is drug dynamics. While a drug has to get to the brain to have an effect, the body does things to the drugs that affects how much of it gets to the brain and for how long it acts. When a drug is taken into the body, it has to be absorbed, and then metabolized, and excreted. Drugs don not stay in the body forever. Because drugs and their metabolites in the blood and brain are often excreted into the urine, screens and tests for drugs focus on the urine and the blood. There are urine screens where the goal is simply to detect the presence of a given drug or drug class. These are often antibody detection procedures. If a screen says that a given drug or drug class is present, a confirmatory test is often done with very sophisticated equipment and great chemical rigor. The equipment used often includes, a gas chromatograph, and a mass spectrometer. This week we also talked a lot about neurotransmission. This is a major key process for understanding drug action in the brain. It's key for understanding therapeutic medicines as well as addicting drugs. I recommend that you thoroughly review the process of neurotransmission in these lectures. And look at the readings which, I believe, will be helpful as well. It's interesting that neurotransmitters are very active substances and have very specific ways of communicating signals in the brain. But if neurotransmitters were turned loose on the brain, the brain would be turned on a, turned on in a chaotic and confusing way. And that's why neurotransmitters are tightly controlled. When they are made, they are packaged so they can't defuse away. They are released only after nerve impulse invades a specific nerve terminal. And they're released into a very narrow and tight space called the synaptic gap. They interact with specific receptors that are close by, and then the neurotransmitter is re, is removed. And its action is terminated. All of this is a way to protect the process of neurotransmission, which must be very specific and selective. A key thing about drugs is that they alter neurotransmission. But they alter neurotransmission in a way that the brain cannot control. The brain coevolved with neurotransmitters and it can control them. It can make them, store them, release them and then remove them from receptors. But the brain can not do the same with drugs, because the brain did not evolve with drugs. That's one of the reasons that drugs have a very profound and long lasting effect on the brain. They terribly distort the process of neurotransmission. And that's how they produce their dramatic effects. We mentioned a couple of examples showing how drugs affect neurotransmission. In one example, we showed that cocaine blocked the dopamine transporter, and thereby increased action at dopamine receptors. When dopamine is greatly increased, the receptor signaling is greatly increased, and the ultimate effect of that pathway is also dramatically increased. The last thing that we just covered, the idea of multifunctionality. Drugs can bind to multiple receptors, therefore, drugs can have multiple effects and we'll see this in later discussions. Thanks for your attention and I'll see you next time. [SOUND] The preceding program is copyrighted by Emory University.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/RMkZR/cocaine-nicotine","Cocaine & Nicotine","In this lecture, I'm going to continue to talk about neurotransmitters and neurotransmission, specifically about how different drugs interact with the process of neurotransmission. Each of the ten different classes of drugs have slightly different actions that somehow alter chemical neurotransmission. In today's lecture, we'll focus on two examples, cocaine and nicotine that either directly or indirectly mimic neurotransmitters. Here we see the familiar diagram of dopaminergic neurotransmission. Dopamine is synthesized. Stored in vesicles. Released, interacts with receptors and is then removed from the receptors by re-uptake. We've talked about the details of this process and because it's so important and fundamental, it's good to revisit it. When cocaine is in the brain at a dopaminergic synapse, cocaine blocks the transporter which blocks the removal of dopamine from the synapse. This has the effect of increasing the level of dopamine in the synaptic space and increasing the level of receptor stimulation. This may occur to a degree that rarely, or perhaps never, happens in ordinary conditions. Cocaine exerts its action by binding to and blocking the dopamine transporter. When the transporter's blocked, dopamine can't be removed. And its levels rise dramatically, causing the receptors to be stimulated dramatically. So very briefly, that's what we can say about how ca, how cocaine works in the brain. This image shows a receptor for acetylcholine, which is related to the drug nicotine. It's an ion channel receptor, meaning that when it's opened, charged ions move through the receptor and the charge distribution across the membrane is altered. That can result in the neuron being excited. So, you can see that when acetylcholine binds to the ion channel receptor, the channels open, the ions flow, and the neuron is affected. Nicotine is like acetylcholine. It binds to the receptor and opens the channel. That's how nicotine works. The receptor site for cocaine is the dopamine transporter, and the receptor for nicotine is the acetylcholine receptor. Both nicotine and cocaine are either direct or indirect mimics of neurotransmitters. Receptors are the sites where the actions of these drugs are initiated. The psychological effects they produce are downstream of these synaptic effects. At this point, it's convenient to point out the differences between the duration of action of drugs versus neurotransmitters. And this is to be remembered because it has major impact on brain function. Neurotransmitters have a duration of action of fractions of a second, as we said earlier. The normal process of neurotransmission is very localized, very discreet and very fast. However, when someone takes cocaine or nicotine, the brain doesn't have a mechanism to remove those substances form the synapse or from their receptors. Because the level or presence of the abused drugs are under the control of the drug-taker rather than the mechanisms in the brain, receptor stimulation gets out of control. The brain has no way to control drugs. The process of neurotransmission is out of control and drugs alter neurotransmission profoundly. Drugs exert their actions for a much longer time than neurotransmitters. All of this is key to understanding at least one of the ways that drugs literally batter the brain. They do it by overworking or dramatically changing certain kinds of neurotransmission processes. We can congratulate ourselves, we've come a long way in understanding how drugs affect the brain. Now, I want to change the topic a little. We've pointed out that dopamine isn't activated by being removed from it's receptors by re-uptake, but not all neurotransmitters are removed from receptors in that way. Acetylcholine, for example, is removed from its receptors by being broken down, literally destroyed. Acetylcholine is broken down by an enzyme, acetycholinesterase, into acetate and choline. Neither acetate nor choline are activate receptors. So the enzymatic breakdown of acetycholine yields inactive products. And this is how the action of acetylcholine is terminated, by breaking down the neurotransmitter. Another important point related to neurotransmitters is that a given neurotransmitter can have multiple receptors. Acetylcholine not only has ion channel receptors, it also has some G protein coupled receptors, and there are subtypes of these subtypes. Dopamine has five different G protein coupled receptors. Receptor multiplicity is a striking feature of the brain. Most neurotransmitters have multiple receptors. Because of these multiple receptors and because they are in multiple locations and can do different things, there are many possible actions of a given neurotransmitter. This is an amazing property of neurotransmission. Namely, that there can be so many actions and processes that can be ascribed to a single neurotransmitter. And appreciation of this leaves us in awe of the brain and how it works.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/Z2Wai/neurotransmitters-the-chemical-messengers-in-the-brain","Neurotransmitters: The Chemical Messengers in the Brain","In this lecture, I will continue to discuss neurotransmitters, those very important chemical signals in the brain. Every thought, sensation, or emotion or idea that we have is because of the action of neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters set off signals that are critical for the function of the brain. Therefore, evolutionary forces have developed mechanisms to control the disposition of neurotransmitters. Let's take a look at a nerve terminal that releases dopamine. The way the brain and nerve cells work. Neurotransmitters such as dopamine are synthesized when they're needed. They're not being made all the time. They're synthesized after some of the neurotransmitter is released, and the levels go down. To replace the neurotransmitter that's released, new neurotransmitter is synthesized. But after synthesis, after they've been made, neurotransmitter molecules have to be stored in a protected way and away from receptors. We don't want stray neurotransmitter floating around the brain setting off signals. For that reason, neurotransmitters are stored in vesicles inside the nerve terminal. When an action potential or a nerve impulse invades the nerve terminal, the vesicles fuse with the membrane of the nerve terminal and release their contents into the synaptic space. Then they are able to interact with receptors to set up signals in the next neuron. So the release of neurotransmitter occurs only in specific places. They're released only from nerve terminals that are depolarized. And they're only released into a specific space where there are receptors. So again, the release and the action of neurotransmitters are tightly controlled. Now an important aspect of neurotransmission as I've mentioned earlier, is that we have to have removal of the neurotransmitter from the receptors. For the dopamine containing nerve terminal, this removal process is an uptake process. Dopamine molecules that are floating around in the synaptic space so that they can interact with receptors, are grabbed up and pumped or transported back into the nerve terminal from where they were released. This is how dopamine nerve terminals terminate the action of released dopamine. The uptake process adds to the efficiency of neurotransmission because some of the dopamine that is taken up is re released. The uptake also restricts the spread of dopamine. As I mentioned before, neurotransmission is a very rapid process. A process that we measure in the thousandths of a second. Any kind of disruption of the overall process can lead to some kind of dysfunction or disease. The very important thing to remember is that drugs work by altering neurotransmission. Drugs work by altering neurotransmission. Another important synaptic component that we've talked about is the receptor. Receptors are the molecular sites that neurotransmitters bind to. The neurotransmitter receptor combination is what produces the signal. There are different kinds of neurotransmitter receptors. There are GPCR or G Protein Coupled Receptors that result in metabolic and biochemical changes in the neuron. There are Ion Channel Receptors that result in changes in charge distribution. And there's other kinds of receptors as well. These will be discussed in more detail later.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/UX4r3/synaptic-transmission-the-target-of-addicting-drugs","Synaptic Transmission: The Target of Addicting Drugs","As we discussed, a drug must get into the brain in order to have an effect. During this lecture, we address what the drugs have to do in the brain to generate a feeling that is positive and something that you want to feel again and again. To understand this, we need to discuss synaptic transmission. Synaptic transmission is a process that occurs in the brain, and that is fundamental to how the brain works. Understanding it is required for understanding how the brain functions. It's also a key for understanding how drugs produce their effect. So, this is going to be very important and fun. There are different words used. And I just used the phrase synaptic transmission. This is the same as neurotransmission. And you will see either term or some hybrid of these words throughout this course. Here we see a picture of the brain, and like any organ in the body, the brain has cells specialized for it's function. If you take a slice of the brain, and look at it under a microscope, you will see a certain cell type that we call nerve cells or neurons. And others as well. Neurons are uniquely shaped cells tailor made for an organ like the brain. The nerve cells has a cell body, as of course do all cells. But it has many processes that extend out from the cell body. There are many that are called dendrites. And dendrites collect signals that come from other cells. The cell body also has an axonal extension or an axon that reaches out to other nerve cells. At the end of the axon is a nerve terminal. And the nerve terminals make very close contact, not an actual physical contact, but a very close apposition with the next cell, or a dendrite on the next cell. So, we have neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, axons, and the nerve terminals. Note that axons can be very long, so by means of an axon, a given nerve cell can influence another nerve cell or actually many nerve cells that are quite a distance away. This diagram shows that neurons form chains or circuits in the brain. Let's look closely at how this works. Here we see a nerve cell body, the axon, and the nerve terminal. The nerve terminal releases substances called neurotransmitters, and these neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the next nerve cell in the circuit. Normally, the way this works is that a nerve impulse or an action potential, starts in a cell body. And this travels down the axon and invades the nerve terminal. When the action potential, or the impulse, invades the nerve terminal, these chemical substances, or chemical signals, that we call neurotransmitters are released. They then diffuse across the space we call the synaptic cleft, or the synaptic gap right here, which is that space between the cells. And the neurotransmitters bind the receptors on the next cell. Once they bind to the receptors on the next cell in the circuit. That cell can then be activated by this binding because the chemical substances, when bound to the receptors, can produce an activation of the next cell. This activation can result in another action potential or impulse, which travels down the axon to the next or to its nerve terminal which causes a release of chemical substances on to the next cell and so forth. This process can go on along the chain containing many nerve cells. This is how circuits or pathways maintain communication. The circuit uses alternating electrical impulses and chemical signaling to maintain activity. And to produce some function. So I stress that it's an alternating electrical and chemical signaling that occurs in the brain allowing a circuit of neurons to ultimately produce some physiological effect. When it comes to understanding drugs and how drugs work the synapse is the most important part. It's important for understanding how antidepressants work, how antipsychotic drugs work, and so forth. So, the synapse is the template upon which we build our knowledge of many, and maybe most drugs, in the brain. Now let me show you an actual picture of nerve terminal obtained with an electron microscope. The nerve terminal is here in the center, and the membrane of the nerve terminal is generally right around these vesicles. You can see the space right here, which is the synaptic gap, you can see the vesicles, you can see them lining up along the membrane just as though they were about to release their contents and you can see, in this case, a post-synaptic thickening. A thickening in the next nerve cell, or the next dendrite, which is important for synaptic transmission. Now, let's consider a neurotransmitter, called dopamine. The slide shows a nerve terminal containing storage vesicles. There are receptors on the post-synaptic cell. And you can see the synaptic gap. When a nerve impulse or action potential invades this nerve terminal, the vesicles fuse with the membrane and secrete the chemical neurotransmitters into the space, into the synaptic space, where they diffuse and interact with the receptors. By interacting with the receptors, signals are set up in this post-synaptic cell. Now, while a neurotransmitter has to act at the receptors to produce a signal, its signaling action has to be eventually stopped. In other words, the neurotransmitter has to be removed from the region of the receptors so that the signaling is discreet. If the signaling didn't stop, but went on and on, it would be a burst of continuous noise rather than a discrete signal. So, neurotransmission is an on off process and it's very brief, of the order of milliseconds or thousandths of a second. It occurs quickly. In the case of dopamine, the way the dopamine molecules are removed from the synaptic space is by transport. Dopamine is taken back up into the nerve terminal. When the neurotransmitter's taken up and put back into the nerve terminal, it's removed from the synaptic gap. This re-uptake or removal of dopamine from the region of the receptors is how neurotransmission, in this case, is terminated. So, in general, neurotransmitters are made in the nerve cells. They're stored in vesicles. They're released by action potentials or electrical impulses. They interact with receptors. And finally, they must be removed from receptors. To summarize, there are three major events that we'll be talking about in neurotransmission. The release of neurotransmitter. Receptor interaction, and the removal from receptors. There are many neurotransmitters, and many addictive drugs focus on, and work at least partly through different neurotransmitters. For example, psycho stimulants like cocaine work directly through dopamine. A stimulant like nicotine will first bind at acetylcholine receptors, but then later they involve dopamine. We'll look at all of these in more detail later on, but there are many neurotransmitters found in the brain that are involved in signaling. And we have to know about them, at least in general, if we're going to understand how drugs work.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/tc3Q7/detecting-drugs-in-the-body","Detecting Drugs in the Body","We discussed how the body handles drugs. And having noted the fact that drugs and lower metabolites end up in urine as well as the blood. We can now talk about a practical issue. Something that follows the fact that a drug accumulates in the urine. In this video, I'm going to talk about the various screens and tests used for detecting drugs and drug use. I'll talk a little bit about the types of tests and how they're done and what they can show. There are many variations on the assays and methods. But I'll present some of the more popular and typical ones. We usually use two different words. Screens and tests. A screen is a broad assay that looks for many different drugs. And the test is an assay that is very specific and rigorous. In general, there are different kinds of assays for screens and tests. There are antibody detection assays, where the shape of the drug molecule is detected by antibodies that bind to it. Because antibodies bind to certain shapes. And that's basically what a screen is. Normally, many different drugs with similar shapes might be detected or react in the assay. And that's one of the reasons that we call them screens. After we detect the potential presence of a drug in urine with a screen, we can then do a much more detailed assay, usually using blood that, the test for drugs in the blood are chemically rigorous and usually are highly specific. Using these tests makes it clear exactly what drug has been taken. These tests utilize expensive equipment that can include gas chromatographs and mass spectrometers. They are very precise in their detection methods. When carrying out drug screening in urine, we have to be aware that levels of a drug in urine will vary in different people. These assays have a detection window that depends on various factors like how well the drug was absorbed in the individual, was the drug metabolized, does the individual have compromised metabolism, and so forth. All of these factors will affect whether or not drugs are detected in urine. I also want to emphasize that a screen may also focus on detecting a metabolite of a drug. Because the metabolite itself may have a longer half life and presence than the drug itself. This table shows three substances, and what is assayed for, and how long after taking the drug they can be detected. The first is cocaine. In many screens, the assay detects a metabolite of cocaine, rather than cocaine itself. And the detection time is two to five days. This means that cocaine pan, can be discovered for up to two to five days after taking it. Screens can detect marijuana as well and some assays also detect a metabolite. In a chronic user, the detection time can be up to 30 or 60 days, a very long time. A drug like morphine can be detected directly, not a metabolite. And, its detection time is about two to four days. From this information, you get the idea about what's detected, and the detection time. And, it may vary, depending on the drug, and also on the individual. In spite of the uncertainties, it is accepted that the drug screens are quite reliable. Screens often relay on antibodies to indicate the presence of a drug in urine. And screens are used because they are less expensive than the more rigorous and reliable chemical tests. If the screen is positive, then the result can be confirmed using a sophisticated analytical technique to rigorously identify the drug that was present. Tests are usually done with blood, and the analytic equipment might include gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Here are some questions to think about. First of all, why is the urine a good place to look for drugs or their metabolites? And second, what's the difference between a screen and a test?",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/mAzTG/drug-dynamics-the-fate-of-drugs-in-the-body","Drug Dynamics: The Fate of Drugs in the Body",">> This program is brought to you by Emory University. >> Hello, today we are going to talk about what the body does to drugs after you take them. Drugs have to get to the brain. That's the only way they can make somebody feel different. And it's the only way to get high. For drugs to get into the brain, they have to be in the blood. And various factors determine how much drug gets into the blood and the brain. And how long they remain there. Overall, what happens to drugs in the body is referred to as drug dynamics. The first thing that happens, after you take a drug orally, is that it has to be absorbed from the stomach and the intestines into the blood. From the blood, it passes into the brain, and again, all of these drugs have to get into the brain to have an effect. A large fraction of the blood pumped from the heart goes directly to the brain. Drugs that are injected directly into the bloodstream are not absorbed by the stomach, but are still passed into the brain. Some drugs, such as nicotine or inhalants, are absorbed directly from the air in the lungs to the blood. Different drugs have different absorption efficiencies. Some drugs are nearly all absorbed and others are not. The next step is that drugs are metabolized or changed. The metabolism, or chemical modification of the drugs, can result in the cessation of their action. And metabolism can also enhance the next step, which is excretion. Drug metabolism usually takes place in the liver, but it can take place in other bodily organs as well. It's the enzymes in the liver and else where that modify the structures of drugs. An example is the metabolism of ethanol. Ethanol, or alcohol, is acted upon by an enzyme called ethanol dehydrogenase, and other enzymes to form acetaldehyde. Which is then changed further into acetate. Acetate is not an active substance. So, a metabolite of ethanol is inactive and the effect of taking ethanol or alcohol is terminated by its metabolism. This next example shows the many possible metabolites of nicotine. You can see that it's extraordinarily complicated. And many different kinds of metabolites and chemical structures are possible. Of course, you don't have to remember all of this, I show you this just to give you an appreciation of how complicated drug metabolism can be. In the next and final step in a drug's journey in the body is drug elimination. Drugs and their metabolites are removed from the body, mainly in the urine or feces. A couple of important concepts related to drug elimination, includes clearance, which is a measure of the body's efficiency in eliminating the drug. And the second is elimination half life. The half life of a drug is a measure of the rate of removal of the drug. It's the time needed to remove or metabolize 50% or half of the drug. So, we have discussed three main steps. Drug absorption, drug metabolism, and drug elimination. This graph deals with the idea of half life. It shows the disappearance of two different substances, A and B, from the blood. And they have different half lives. Drug A has a shorter half life and drug B has a half life twice that of A. When we look at the levels of these drugs in the blood, which are the solid lines, you can see that one of the curves falls to zero much faster than the other. And, that means that Drug A has a shorter half-life. If the half-life is shorter, then the drug disappears faster. Normally, for 97% of a drug to be eliminated from the body, it will take 5 half-lives. But, if a drug is taken orally, then the drug has to be absorbed first. It builds up slowly in the blood, which are the dotted lines in this image. After it builds up to its peak, it is then eliminated at a rate according to its half-life. It's worthwhile pointing out that not all drugs are metabolized in this fashion. Ethanol, for example, is metabolized at a steady rate rather than at a fractional rate. Now, I'll introduce the topic for next time. One of the practical impacts of a drug being excreted into the urine is that many drug screens and tests have been developed to screen for the presence of drugs in the urine. It's interesting that sometimes the metabolites of a drug persist in the urine for longer periods than the drug itself. Therefore, in some cases, the targets of the test can be the metabolites of the drugs. We'll discuss this in more detail next time. [BLANK_AUDIO]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/dlbpz/sedatives-anti-anxiety-agents-hypnotics","Sedatives, Anti-Anxiety Agents, & Hypnotics","This lecture will be about sedatives, anti anxiety agents, and hypnotics. By definition, a sedative is a calming agent and a hypnotic is a sleep inducer. A hypnotic is sometimes the same drug as a sedative, but simply used at a higher dose. Anti-anxiety agents, are similar to sedatives, and they reduce anxiety and facilitate sleep. There are several types of drugs in this class, the first and the most widely used are the benzodiazepines, which include Xanax and Valium. There are non-benzodiazepines types such as zolpidem, or ambien. There are also the Carbamates and barbiturates which are not really used very much anymore. There's another non bensodiazepine, buspirone or buspur, which is reported to have little or no abuse or addiction. In this group we could include alcohol and marijuana if we wanted to. Usually, when talking about drugs in this group, we focus on the Benzodiazepines. This is because the Benzodiazepines are unique in terms of safety. Very high doses of these drugs alone, do not automatically cause death by overdose. For this reason, because they are relatively safe, benzodiazepines are probably the most used medications in this class. However, when taken with other depressants such as alcohol, they can increase the lethality of those substances, because drug users often take more than one drug. The interactions of benzodiazepines with other drugs is important to know about. Commonly used Benzodiazepines include Valium, Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin and Halcion. These are the proprietary names, and they have non-proprietary names as well, and you may hear either name. The effects of benzodiazepines includes sedation (up to intoxication), decreased anxiety, muscle relaxation, sleep, amnesia. The amnesia is usually for events that occur after taking the drugs, anti-convulsants activity, and unfortunately abuse and addiction. The benzodizapine receptor, or the the molecular site at which the benozodizapines act is the GABA-A receptor. And the effect of benzodiazepines is to increase the action of GABA. Benzodiazepines make the inhibitory effect of GABA greater. GABA is an abbreviation for Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid. It is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. It has both ion channel receptors and G protein coupled receptors. The ion channel receptors are termed GABA-A receptors, and they mediate the flow of chloride ions in and out of the cell. GABA-A receptors, like many ion channel type receptors, have multiple protein subunits, and the subunits are often grouped together as pentamers, meaning five proteins bundled together. An example of a GABA-A receptor is shown in the image. Structurally, it's similar to the nicotine receptor that I've spoken to you about. This is a top down view, the GABA-A receptor has multiple subunits that bundle together, such that the chloride channel is formed. The GABA binding site is distinct from the benzodiazepine binding site. And benzodiazepine binding to the receptor facilitates and increases the action of GABA. By itself, benzodiazepine binding to the receptor has no effect. Benzodiazepines only have an effect when GABA is present. They could be called neurotransmitter modulators. If one abruptly discontinues benzodiazepine use after prolonged use, a person may experience benzodiazepine withdrawal. Some patients can have a very serious withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal signs and symptoms include anxiety, tremor, nightmares, insomnia, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, seizures and delirium. In fact, abrupt withdrawal can sometimes be fatal. But withdrawal does not always occur. But the return of anxiety symptoms at least is very likely. Usually, if you're taking the drug for therapeutic reasons under the care of a doctor, stopping its use would involve reducing the dose gradually over a period of time. This gradual reduction tends to minimize any withdrawal symptoms, and the tendency to relapse to use. Effective treatment exists for those addicted to the benzodiazepine. Treatments includes medications and behavioral therapies. While the benzodiazepines are a very important class of drugs that are very helpful to many patients, they also have toxicities and concerns, and addictions certainly is one of them. Next week, we will cover the last three classes of abused and addicting drugs. We will also discuss animal models of addiction next week.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/9XYsg/opiate-drugs","Opiate Drugs","Today we're going to talk about the opiate drugs. These are among the most important drugs in medicine because they're used to reduce pain. If we look at the table of lifetime drug use, we see that prescription pain killers are in double digits. And heroin is significant, as well. So the opiate drugs, in addition to their very important role as pain killers, cause addiction and dependence and are public health problems. More specifically, they're important because they reduce moderate to severe pain, and there are no other substances that do that as effectively. When taken under medical supervision few problems occur. However, in some individuals, in some situations, repeated use can lead to dependence and addiction. Morphine, which is the typical opiate, is a natural product. It is the most abundant opiate in the poppy plant. It's extracted from the poppy plant by cutting the surface of the seed pod and out of that cut a so-called milk is harvested. Morphine is contained in and purified from that milk exuded from the seed pod. The image shows the structure of some typical opiate drugs which include morphine and heroin, which is made from morphine. Some synthetic substances which are morphine-like are listed, as well. The effects of opiates are well known. They reduce pain, produce euphoria, cause tolerance and addiction. Promote relaxation, cause constipation, slow breathing, and it's because of the slowed breathing that some people die after an overdose. They also constrict pupils and cause nausea and vomiting. In the hospital emergency room, someone presenting with constricted pupils and depressed breathing would be suspected of having an opiate overdose. If a person is addicted, and stops taking the drug, he or she will experience a variety of withdrawal symptoms and signs. These include dysphoria, a craving for the drug, diarrhea and vomiting, pain, sweating, tremors, mental confusion, etc. The withdrawal syndrome from opiate drugs is quite uncomfortable, and it can drive many users back into taking drugs. This brings up an issue for all addicting substances. And we can step back for a moment and consider three hypotheses for addiction. One, is that addicts keep taking drugs to satisfy cravings and to avoid withdrawal. A second, is that addicts take drugs to get euphoric or high. A third, is that addicts take drugs to deal with other physical or psychiatric problems. Another possibility is that addicts take drugs for a combination of these reasons. It seems that most people would fit into these categories. Again, these hypotheses apply not only to the opiates that we're discussing here today, but to all drugs. There are treatments available for those who are addicted to opiates. I'll be talking in more detail about treatment later in this course. But some well known substances used in treatment are listed here. Methadone is an opiate substance in itself and is used to reduce drug craving. Naltrexone is an opiate blocker. And if someone takes Naltrexone, they will experience no effect of taking morphine or any other opiate. These medicines are used in a medical setting so the drug craving can be controlled, and patients can strive to develop a life without drugs. And now an obvious question, is how do opiates work? Well, they stimulate receptors for naturally occurring neurotransmitters called opioids. Again, we have abused drugs who's basis of action is a system that's already found in the brain. The image shows some opioid neurotransmitters that opiate drugs interact with. These neurotransmitters are peptides or chains of amino acids. They are the enkephalins, the endorphins, dynorphins, nociceptins, and others. Opioid peptide neurotransmitters are just like other neurotransmitters. They are made, stored in vesicles, released when nerve term, when nerve impulses invade the nerve terminal. And they interact with specific receptors. There are several opioid receptors, and they're all G protein-coupled receptors. There are Mu opioid receptors which are related to analgesia, euphoria, respiratory depression, and physical dependence. There are Delta receptors and Kappa receptors, and they have a slightly different profile in terms of what they cause. All of these receptors, the Mu, Delta, Kappa, and others have sub-types, so there are many opiate receptors overall. Because the sub-types have different distributions in the brain, drugs that stimulate the various sub-types of receptors can have a variety of different effects. So here are the main points of opiate drugs. They are important of the practice of medicine. And because of the side effects of abuse and addiction, they are also serious public health problems. There availability can be controlled. But because of their importance in medicine, they cannot be eliminated. They act through systems already in the brain, and there are treatment programs available for people who are hooked on opiates. Some of these treatment programs use opiate related drugs to help the patients deal with their problem.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/1oCUp/hallucinogens","Hallucinogens","This lecture is devoted to the hallucinogens. The hallucinogens are drugs that alter consciousness by inducing sensory and perceptual disturbances. The user can experience a distortion of something. Or perhaps, even something that isn't there at all. Data show that hallucinogens have been used by more than 14% of the population, age 12 or older. There are two general categories of hallucinogens, and I'll discuss them separately. The first category is the Phencyclidine. Known as PCP, or angel dust. Or other PCP types of hallucinogens. The image shows the structure of PCP. And the structure of another, similar compound, called ketamine. These compounds are called dissociative anesthetics. They're called that because they produce feelings of separation of mind and body. Quite an interesting but scary effect. Intravenous administration can cause a schizophrenic like state, with psychosis and catatonia, which is a stuporous, immobile state. These drug effects can lead to injuries from accidents, fights, falls, and many other things. Animal research and testing strongly suggests that PCP is addicting. Intoxication from PCP use also includes disorientation, confusion, hallucinations, delusions, and coma at high doses. It's easy to see that this is a very toxic substance that renders an individual fairly incapable of functioning in the real world. How does it work in the brain? PCP interferes with the major excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. It inhibits glutamate neurotransmission at a subtype of receptor, which is the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor. PCP blocks that receptor. Now let's consider the other hallucinogens, which comprise a very diverse group of substances. Here we see LSD, also known as acid, and MDMA, also known as Molly, or ecstasy, an there are others listed, as well. LSD produces visual hallucinations that can be frightening, and have sometimes led to suicide. LSD can also cause a persistent perceptual experience, even when the drug is not present. This can be a very worrisome, and disabling experience. The mechanism of LSD appears to be related to serotonin receptors, presumably by stimulating the serotonin 2A subtype of receptor. But, additional mechanisms are probably also in play. MDMA, or ecstasy, is both a stimulant and a hallucinogen. It's been used in psycho therapy, where it's thought to produce insights and self-knowledge, but most people feel that this has not been adequately proven. What are the neurotoxicities of MDMA, that we've talked about? And another substance called MDA? [SOUND] In animal studies, these substances cause a degeneration of nerve terminals of neurons, containing the nerve transmitter serotonin. So they can me neuronaly destructive, certainly at higher doses. And there's evidence that this occurs, at least partly, in human beings as well. This is not a minor toxicity. In summary, hallucinogens can be divided into two major groups. The PCP type, and the other types that include LSD. They have different mechanisms in brain, sometimes complex mechanisms, and sometimes complex actions. In addition to the acute problem of perceptual distortion, they have some other serious toxicities",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/hOdDH/psychostimulants","Psychostimulants","Hello. Today we're going to talk about psychostimulants, some of the most important drugs in the addiction field. A significant number of people who are 12 years of age or older have used cocaine, crack, and methamphetamine. Cocaine and amphetamine have approved medical uses. Cocaine is used in surgery because it is both a vasoconstrictor and a local anesthetic. Amphetamine has two FDA approved indications. One is to treat ADHD and the other is to treat narcolepsy, a sleep disorder. The stimulants include cocaine and many amphetamines. They're ingested orally, snorted, smoked or injected. Smoking and injecting provide the fastest entry to the brain and are the most reenforcing and addicting ways of taking the drug. These drugs are most commonly associated with hemorrhages and stroke, which seem to be due to the fact that they're potent vasoconstrictors, which reduce the size of blood vessels and which raises blood pressure. Cocaine's been around for a long time. It's derived from the plant Erythroxylum coca and Erythroxylum novogranatense. In the hydrochloride salt form, it's been used for many, many years. More recently, crack cocaine has been used, and it is still cocaine, but a different form of cocaine. Crack vaporizes at a lower temperature than cocaine hydrochloride, and therefore it can be smoked. When smoked, the vapors get into the lungs, and the cocaine very efficiently gets transferred into the blood, which goes to the brain. It's likely that crack cocaine is more addicting and easier to use than cocaine hydrochloride. The next slide shows two of the many amphetamine type drugs. One is just regular amphetamine, and the other is methamphetamine, which has a chemical methyl group attached to the end of the amphetamine molecule. In general, such a small modification can sometimes cause significant shifts in actions and toxicities. When you compare cocaine and amphetamine, they are very similar in what users experience. Because of the similarity, users don't distinguish between cocaine and amphetamine. But there is a significant difference in their half-lives. Amphetamine has a much longer duration of action. How do these substances work? Well, psychostimulant drugs affect many neurotransmitters in the brain. As you know, they act at transporters, and it's been shown that the dopamine transporter is the target for the reinforcing or addicting effects of these drugs. Blockade of the dopamine transporter, not other targets, is related to the addicting properties of cocaine. This slide shows the dopaminergic synapse, again. It shows that dopamine is released from vesicles into the synaptic gap, where it reacts with receptors. And it is removed from the receptors on the synapse by transporters. On the right hand side, it's shown that cocaine blocks the transporter so the dopamine builds up in the synaptic cleft and causes a much greater receptor stimulation. This slide shows very clearly that cocaine plugs up and blocks the functioning transporter. Amphetamine, which is a smaller molecule, also blocks the transporter, but it also rides the transporter into the nerve terminal, and it causes the release of more dopamine. So amphetamine not only blocks, but it also causes the release of dopamine as well. Therefore cocaine is only a blocker, whereas amphetamine is both the blocker and the releaser. As I mentioned, there are other amphetamine-like substances. Perhaps the best known are MDMA, which is called Molly, and MDE, which has been called Eve, which together, or sometimes separately, make up Ecstasy. Ecstasy is a substance which is abused and can be dangerous. You remember that we talked about drugs having the ability to have multiple functions? Well, amphetamines are stimulants, but some of them are also hallucinogens so they have a more complex effect compared to some other substances. MDMA and MDE are believed to have hallucinogenic properties, as well as stimulant properties. The acute effects of amphetamine and cocaine are very similar. A notable effect is euphoria, which is certainly one of the reasons that these drugs are taken. They also produce a feeling of confidence and grandiosity. They enhance sexual performance, increase sensory awareness. But they can also interfere with sleep. The chronic effects of cocaine and amphetamine produce the symptoms of many psychiatric disorders. These include panic disorder, paranoia, and schizophrenia. There is a tolerance to the euphoric effects, which prompts the taking of more and more of the substance, which leads to greater toxicities of dependence and addiction. There are other toxicities as well, for example, methamphetamine can cause neuronal damage and some of the other amphetamines can as well. Some of this will be discussed in more detail in later lectures. Let's review the toxicities of these compounds. There was, of course, addiction and the long lasting brain changes that go with it. There are the effects of elevated blood pressure, sometimes for long periods of time. There is a development of withdrawal, which includes depression and dysphoria, which is called a crash. Another toxicity is psychosis, which can have serious consequences. Psychostimulant abuse is prevalent and dangerous. What about treatment? Approaches to treatment are wide ranging and include getting an education about the substances, the teaching of and learning of self control techniques, and the taking of medications where needed.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/r3Va1/marijuana","Marijuana","A common drug of abuse is marijuana. The term marijuana usually refers to a couple of plants. One is cannabis sativa and another is cannabis indica. These plants contains mind altering compounds that we call cannabinoids. And two major cannabinoids known to have effects in humans are abbreviated THC and CBD. They stand for Tetrahydrocannabinol and Cannabidiol. And there are many other compounds in these plants. An important thing about marijuana, is that there is a trend to legalize its use. [BLANK_AUDIO] What do cannabinoids do? Cannabinoids are believed to get you high, relaxed and more social. They produce a calm and mildly euphoric state. The effects from smoking the plant last from two to four hours. Medical marijuana, a term referred to as the use of marijuana in medicine, has been used for pain and nausea and weight loss in AIDS patients. But, cannabinoids can induce transient schizophrenic-like symptoms in healthy individuals. Also, smoking marijuana can worsen symptoms in patients who are already psychotic. Cannabinoids impair memory, judgement, balance, and problem solving. And they are reported to increase apathy. How do they work? Cannabinoids work by interacting with endogenous, meaning naturally occurring substances in the brain. The endocanabinoids. Endocannabinoids are neuro transmitters involved in many physiologic functions. The cannabinoids can be agonist, which means neurotransmitter like at endocannabinoid receptors. [BLANK_AUDIO] Well known endocannabinoids include Anandamide and what we call 2-AG, and there are some others. A common function of the endocannabinoids is to inhibit the release of other neurotransmitters in a retrograde action. This is something new. Up until now, the only thing we've considered is a forward action of transmitters. That is, neurotransmitters are released from the pre-synaptic nerve terminal and act at receptors on the post-synaptic neuron. In the retrograde idea, neurotransmitters are released from the post-synaptic side and act back at the pre-synaptic nerve terminal. There're two well-studied cannabinoid receptors, CB1 which is widely distributed in the brain and CB2, which is mainly thought to be in the periphery. Both are G-protein coupled receptors. There may be some other receptors as well. This slide shows the chemical structures of the endocannabinoids. They do not look like the cannabinoids that come from the plants, like THC. But that's common. Drugs don't always look like the neurotransmitters that they interact with. After release, endocannabinoids are broken down by enzymes, abbreviated FAAH and MAG Lipase. Those abbreviations stand for fatty acid amide hydrolase and monoacyl-glycerol lipase. Now for some final comments. Every existing neurotransmitter system in the body, offers opportunities to develop new medications. The entire science of pharmacology is largely founded on modifying naturally occurring systems, with external substances we refer to as medications. The endocannabinoid system has the same potential. New medications can be synthesized based on the endocannabinoid system and its receptors. In terms of lethality, cannabinoids are safer than other medications. It's not surprising that explorations for new endocannabinoid based medications are well underway in many laboratories.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/Gj2BE/nicotine","Nicotine","Today we're going to talk about nicotine. Nicotine is the addicting substance in tobacco. It's responsible for the repeated use of tobacco products even though they're very harmful. Tobacco's legal for, for adults. And the problem is that tobacco smoke is an enemy of public health. Let's talk about the good, the bad, and the ugly of nicotine. First, the good. Nicotine is a cognitive enhancer. It improves attention, memory, and computational abilities. It also improves motor abilities. The bad. Is that nicotine produces dependence. It maintains chronic smoking, and the use of other tobacco products. The ugly is that smoking causes 5 million premature deaths word, world wide per year. It reduces the lifespan of smokers by an average of ten years. And smoking is associated with various diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and others. Can a smoker stop smoking? Well yes, but it may not be easy. Surveys reveal that 75% of smokers say they want to stop, and about 33% try to stop every year, but less than 3% actually stop. So, relapse is widespread, and nicotine addiction is powerful. Let's talk about the fundamental mechanism and action of nicotine. How does it work? We spoke about the nicotine receptor as an example when we were talking about drug receptors. The nicotine receptor is normally a receptor for acetylcholine. A well known neruo transmitter. The image shows both the side view and a top down view of the receptor. The side view's been shown before and nicotine acts like acetylcholine in that it binds to the receptor and opens the receptor channel. And ions flow through it. It's an ion channel receptor. Now if we examine the top down view of the receptor, we can get more information about them. First of all, nicotine receptors are composed of bundles of proteins, or protein subunits as they're called. And the brain makes several different kinds of sub unit proteins. So that the protein composition of nicotinic receptors can vary in different parts of the brain. The most common form of the receptor has alpha 4 and beta 2 protein sub units. It's called the alpha 4 and beta 2 subtype. And their other subtypes of receptors with kinds of protein supplements. When someone takes a puff of smoke from a cigarette the trans, the transfer of nicotine from the air in the lungs to the blood is very efficient. And because nicotine gets into the blood, it enters the brain very quickly. That is when within seconds after a puff. As it diffuses into the brain, it binds to the receptors and opens the ion channels and causes an influx of sodium ions. An efflux of potassium ions and sometimes an influx of calcium. As we've talked about earlier the brain doesn't have a way to remove or break down nicotine. It can break down acetylcholine very easily but not nicotine. So the effects of nicotine linger over time in the brain. Another point that needs to be made is that nicotine receptors can be located pre-synaptically. Up to this point, we've only talked about post-synaptic receptors, that receive neurotransmitters from the presynaptic nerve terminal. But there are also receptors on nerve terminals. And these are called presynaptic. A typical action for a presynaptic receptor is to alter neurotransmitter release into the synapse. It turns out that dopamine containing nerve terminals have presynaptic nicotine receptors. And when nicotine is taken, dopamine rel, dopamine release is increased in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex, which are reward areas. We think that the Alpha4-beta2 subtype may be responsible for this effect. It's also important to note that, through it's action at receptors, nicotine causes many effects. Other neurotransmitters are affected as well. And these include serotonin, glutamate and opioid peptides, for example. The effects of nicotine are varied, we've already mentioned that nicotine can enhance attention, mood and reaction time. It can also produce relaxation during stress. And it can cause an activation where blood pressure is increased and heart rate and cardiac output are increased as well. Many people who smoke have additional mental health problems. We refer to this as comorbidity, as I mentioned earlier. It's been found that patients with schizophrenia, depression and ADHD have a higher level of cigarette smoking than average. [COUGH] Now, for the demon in the brain, if you stop smoking, you can go through a very troubling and disruptive withdrawal syndrome. It's characterized by irritability, frustration, anger, anxiety, dysphoria and depression, a lack of concentration and so forth. Because the withdrawal syndrome is such a problem for smokers, relapse is high as we mentioned earlier. Is there treatment for smokers? Of course there is. There are many programs that include behavioral treatments and effective medications. Hopefully the treatments for smokers are becoming more effective and useful all the time. An important new device that has appeared is the electronic cigarette. The electronic cigarette, can, look like a cigarette, but it has no smoke. A heating element vaporizes a nicotine solution, so that you get to inhale nicotine without smoke. Obviously, this eliminates smoke toxicity. Because this device administers nicotine and thereby controls craving without smoke, like the nicotine patch, it's use in treatment is being considered. We don't have a lot of experience with electronic cigarettes, but we'll learn about them over the years. And we'll find out what the risks may be. An obvious risk is that nicotine is still add, addicting.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/edFv1/alcohol","Alcohol","This program is brought to you by Emory University. [BLANK_AUDIO] >> This week, we'll begin to discuss the ten classes of abused and addicting drugs. It can be helpful to group these various drugs into classes. If we discover something about one drug in a class, it's reasonable to assume that it will apply to other drugs in the class. Similarly, if a successful treatment is discovered for a given drug, then it may very well apply to other members of that class, so classifying drugs is convenient and has its uses. The ten different classes of drugs are alcohol, tobacco and nicotine and it's really nicotine because nicotine is the substance in tobacco that is addicting. Caffeine, cannabis or marijuana, inhalants, opioids, sedatives and anti-anxiety agents such as Xanax. Psychostimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine, hallucinogenic agents such as PCP and LSD. And the last class that is sort of a catch all that we call other. It won't be possible to talk about every detail of the drugs in these classes, but I'll select some examples and give an overview. As we go on, we'll cover more and more material about these drugs. We can begin with the first class, which is alcohol, a single drug. Alcohol or ethanol is the addicting substance in drinks. While it is legal, its use is restricted, sometimes by law. For example, while driving. Alcohol is one of the most used and abused drugs on the planet, and it is a significant public health problem. Here's the bad news. In the United States, alcohol ranks third in disease impact, so it is significant. Also in the United States, there are eight million dependent drinkers. Dependent means that if they stop drinking, they will go into withdrawal and feel very, very bad. A third of all cases of all cases of liver disease are associated with alcohol abuse. Alcohol is the leading cause of traumatic injuries in the western world. Finally, there's a strong association between alcohol use and other public health and mental health disorders. There's no argument against the idea that alcohol is a public health problem. Because alcohol is a major concern, the amount that you can drink safely has been explored and considered. A weekly intake of no more than five drinks for men and two drinks for women is associated with lowest mortality. This suggests that a low level use of alcohol may be, in fact, healthy. The NIAAA, which stands for the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, recommends no more than 14 drinks per week for men and 7 for women. We see that the recommendations for women are for fewer drinks than for men. Women seem to be more sensitive to alcohol than men. The daily use of over 15 drinks per day for men and 10 for women will likely lead to dependence, so we have a rough idea of the limits of alcohol intake. What are the effects of ethanol intake? Like all drugs, the effects observed depend on the dose that's been given. Roughly, and in accordance with increasing doses, the following are observed. A loss of muscular coordination, changes in mood, personality, and behavior, mental impairment, obvious intoxication, coma, and sometimes death. As I've said about drug use in general, many people can walk away from drinking, but many don't, and dependence and addiction develop. This slide suggests that if you drink fairly heavily for a year, then you will have a 14% chance of becoming dependent. If you drink for five years, there's a 50% chance you'll become dependent. So, it is not a small problem and the odds that you can get into trouble are significant. As I mentioned earlier, dependence implies that if you stop taking alcohol, you will go into withdrawal. And alcohol withdrawal can be very serious. The signs that appear depend on the stage and degree of addiction. For example, you might observe tremor, insomnia, nausea or vomiting, hallucinations, anxiety and agitation, and even seizures. Sometimes, death occurs during withdrawal in those individuals who are severely addicted. How does alcohol work? It looks as though are, there are a couple of important mechanisms by which alcohol produces its rewarding effects. First of all, it has been observed that ingestion of alcohol causes a release of dopamine in reward-related areas of the brain. It's known that the opioid systems are involved. The opioids are the naturally occurring neurotransmitters related to opiate drugs. Opioid blockers reduce drinking, which is an important treatment option. Also, alcohol increases the action of GABA, which is an inhibitory neural transmitter, and it blocks a Glutamate receptor, the NMDA receptor, and Glutamate is an excitatory neural transmitter. So, alcohol increases inhibition and decreases excitation, suggesting an overall depression of neuronal activity. This is likely related to the impairment that we commonly witness in people who have taken alcohol. There are other suspected mechanisms of action as well that we won't discuss here. In previous lectures, I've talked about ethanol metabolism. Ethanol is broken down in the body by various enzymes that eventually produce acetate. Acetate is inactive and so, ethanol is metabolized to an inactive substance. Three standard drinks of any kind in rapid succession can challenge the capacity of metabolism and result in impairment of driving and significant blood alcohol levels. It could take four to five hours to completely metabolize that amount of alcohol. Spreading out the intake over time would give metabolism more of a chance to keep blood levels lower. Let me summarize what I've talked about. First of all, it's clear that alcohol is a dangerous substance, particularly when consumed in large quantities. Its effect, its effects are synergistic or additive with those of other sedatives and therefore, other sedatives such as Xanax or Valium become more dangerous. There's evidence that alcohol produces cell death in the brain, and, of course, we know that alcohol produces addiction tolerance and withdrawal. I will talk about treatment in more detail later in the course, but at this point in time, let us simply say that there are effective treatments available. There are medications and support groups, and we know that treatment works. You should be familiar with the website of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. It's an excellent source of information of all kinds. If you have an interest in this area, you may want to go to that site.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/9JztI/conditioned-place-preference","Conditioned Place Preference","Today we're going to discuss, another animal model, that we call Conditioned Place Preference, or CPP for short. This model does not require a surgical procedure for the animals. Therefore preparation and maintenance of the animals are easier, and carry fewer health risks. CPP does require that the investigator injects the animals, and then uses a simple piece of equipment, which is a two or sometimes three chambered box, with two very dissimilar chambers on each end. CPP is generally agreed to be less complicated, than drug self-administration. There are photocells in the boxes, to measure how much time the animal spends in either chamber. This image shows a Conditioned Place Preference apparatus, made up of two very dissimilar chambers. One chamber might have a grid floor, and a checkered wall, while the other might be smooth. In CPP, there's a training phase followed by a testing phase. In the training phase, the animal is injected with a drug, or saline, and then placed into a specific chamber. Always the same chamber. This is done several times. For example, if the animal were injected with the drug, you might choose to place it in the chamber with the grid floor, and if treated with saline, it might go into the chamber with the smooth floor. In this training period, the animal learns to associate the feeling caused by the drug, with a specific chamber. If the drug was rewarding and positive, on a test day, where no drug is given, the animal will spend more time in the chamber, where it experienced the drug. It's as though the animal is trying to find the drug experience. This test associates environment with drug experience. Among human drug users, environment can be a very significant factor, in the drug experience. We know several things about condition place preference. When saline is given during the training period, the animal spends about equal time, in both chambers, during the test period. Saline is not rewarding, and does not provide a positive or even negative experience for the animal. When a rewarding drug like cocaine is given, the animal will spend more time in the chamber it associates with the cocaine experience. Also, there is an interesting advantage with this procedure. If an aversive drug, which is unpleasant or painful is given to the animal, it will avoid that chamber. So the test is useful for both preferred and aversive drugs. This is restated in this table. Please study it and decide, what you would predict if the smooth floor were used with the drug, instead of the grid floor. In summary, CPP is a simpler procedure than drug self-adminstration. Because animal surgery is not required, and the testing apparatus is simpler. Also, CPP can identify, either rewarding or aversive substances. There is yet another important animal model, Electrical Brain Stimulation Reward. This procedure is based under the discovery, that animals will press levers, to self stimulate electrically, certain brain regions that are sometimes called pleasure centers, or reward sites. It shows that there are feeling good centers in our brain as expected. It is similar to drug self-administration, in that the animal controls giving the stimulus to itself. Drugs can interact with electric self-stimulation, according to the following idea. Like the electrical stimulation, addicting drugs produce pleasure. Therefore, when drugs are present in the brain, and the reward centers, the amount of electrical stimulation needed to satisfy the animal is less. Because some pleasure is already there from the drug, less electrical stimulation is needed. This is another way of showing that drugs interact with naturally occurring brain centers, that provide positive feelings feelings.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/BY9wd/animal-model-of-drug-self-adminstration-part-2","Animal Model of Drug Self-Adminstration, Part 2","In this video, we're going to continue to talk about the drug self-administration model. We're going to describe yet another use of this procedure that allows us to explore the value of a substance to an animal. To quantitatively determine how much the animal wants the drug, we're going to talk about the break-point. The break-point is used to measure how much work the animal will do to get the drug. Let me review some of the basic things needed to understand this. In the drug self-administration paradigm, the animal has undergone surgery such that a catheter is placed inside a jugular vein. The animal's presented with two levers and they both result in the delivery of a substance through the catheter. One lever results in the delivery of drugs such as cocaine, while the other delivers saline or water. The animal quickly learns which is the cocaine-related lever and presses that lever relentlessly. If the experimenter switches levers, so the cocaine is now delivered by pressing the other lever, the animal quickly learns that this change has been made. The animal switches his preference for the other lever, which delivers cocaine. The computer and investigator control the frequency of the injections and the dose. Now, we haven't discussed this detail before, but the animal does not have to get the drug for each and every individual lever press. It can be set up so that more than one lever press is required to get an injection. Now we can define the ratio. When a drug injection is given every time that there's a lever press, the ratio is one. If five lever presses are required to get one drug injection, the ratio is five. As you increase the ratio, a point is reached where the animal gives up pressing. That ratio is called the break-point. We can relate this to our own experience. If we have to press a lever to get a very nice, desirable dessert, we would do so. But if the number of lever presses required to get the tasty dessert were increased steadily, then we'd reach a point at which we would lose interest. The number of lever presses, the work required, the time required would be just more than we're interesting in giving to get that particular dessert. But if to the, the dessert were more desirable, then you might be willing to press more. So as I mentioned, the break-point is a measure of how much the animal will work to get the drug. It's a measure of the drug's value to the animal. We can talk about a real experiment. A brain chemical called CART Peptide is known to reduce the behavioral effects of cocaine when it is injected into a specific region of the brain. The question is, is CART affecting how the animal values the drug or is it having some other nonspecific effect on behavior? When the drug was employed in the break-point study, the result showed that injection of CART peptide lowered the break-point, suggesting that CART somehow lowered the value of the drug to the animal. This implies that a substance with actions similar to CART peptide might be a good medication for cocaine users because it will reduce the interest of users in cocaine. These few comments allow us to see yet another use of drug self-administration. It helps us consider new ideas for treatment. Before we end, it's important that I mention one caveat. Throughout these experiments, I have often interpreted the animal's behavior in terms of human experience. I've used words that the animal chooses or that the animal values, which we usually apply to humans. Some investigators feel that we should be very cautious about that kind of description of animal behavior. We should be cautious in applying human motivations to animal behaviors.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/xaF59/animal-model-of-drug-self-administration-part-1","Animal Model of Drug Self-Administration, Part 1","Today we're going to talk about an important animal model for studying drug addiction. We've already mentioned that a good animal model will reproduce results that have been previously found in humans. That helps validate the model. It should also predict results that will be found in humans. And further, it should allow us to study the underlying brain mechanisms that cause the addiction. The animal model of drug self administration meets these criteria. Historically, the effects of drugs have been studied when researchers inject the animals with drugs. Note that this is called passive drug administration. Because the animal doesn't really do anything to get the drug. It's simply injected. This approach has been very useful and has elucidated many aspects of drug use, such as tolerance and dependence. But this does not convincingly include in the experiment, the motivation to take drugs, or the act of doing something to get the drug, which is what happens in real life. An arrangement where the animal chooses to take the drug would be better. In drug self administration, an animal chooses, if we can use that word, to take a drug by pressing a lever. The image shows an animal in a quiet box. A catheter enters the animal through the skin on it's back, and the catheter has been placed inside its jugular vein in a previous surgery. This arrangement allows an injection to be made directly into the animal's jugular vein. The animal becomes accustomed to the catheter, just as though it were on a leash. In the procedure, the animal is presented with two levers. Each lever results in the delivery of a substance through the catheter. Pressing one lever results in the delivery of a drug such as cocaine. Pressing the other lever results in something like saline or water. The animal quickly learns which is the cocaine related lever and presses that lever relentlessly. The non-drug or saline related lever is largely ignored. Note that the dose and frequency of dosing are controlled by the computer, so that there's no danger of overdose, and the animals are protected. In this procedure, the animal doesn't know, in the human sense, that it's getting a drug injection. After all, the drug injection is controlled by the experimenter. But, if the animal has a sensation that is positive and associates it with pressing a given lever, then the animal will press that lever again and again. Because the the animal is pressing the cocaine lever again and again, rather than the saline related lever, we know that cocaine holds a special meaning for this animal. The drug is producing something positive, such that the animal wants more and more. It's interesting and surprising to some that the self administration dose-response curve is not simple. It is an inverted U. When more drug is included in the injection, the response, which is the number of level presses increases. But at some point, increasing the dose per injection results in a decrease in the rate of lever pressing. We're tempted to interpret this in human terms. At the lower doses, as the dose increases, we press the lever more, more often. Because we recognize the drug as positive more often. But at the higher doses, the dose is so high that we are sated by the previous injection, and therefore press the lever less often. But we can't be sure that this is what's really happening all the time. Inverted U response curves are found elsewhere in biology and in other fields. the possible meaning of this result can take some thought. It is important and very relevant that animals will self administer almost all drugs that human abuse. Thus, the model has this kind of validity. Also and importantly, the discovery of this animal model has changed our view of drug addiction by humans. We can see that it is not a uniquely human disease or problem. Drug use depends on our physiology, which we share with animals. Drug self-administration has become regarded as a reasonably reliable test of the likelihood of addiction. For example, an unknown medication or drug. Even something to, expected to be used for arthritis or depression or whatever, can be tested to see if it is self-administered. If it is, then we must consider that a side effect of this drug might be that it is rewarding and potentially addicting. You can see how useful this is. Also, the self-administering animal can be treated in a variety of ways, to see if that treatment affects drug self-administration. for example, the animal could be exposed to various behavioral, or surgical, or pharmacological pre-treatments. Medications have been discovered using this model, when for example, the medication reduces drug self-administration. Self-administration studies played a major role in discovery of Naltrexone and Baclofen for treating alcoholism. Again, you can see how useful this is. The self administration diagram helps us understand the various phases of drug abuse and addiction in humans. In this particular approach, self-administration is quantified. The experiment is divided up into many time slots shown on the x-axis. And the number of lever presses in each time slot is shown on the y-axis. Drug self-administration can be resolved into four phases. That are similar to phases of human drug use. The graph shows that the animal has 11 drug self-administration sessions. In session one, the animal apparently learns which lever delivers cocaine, and it presses that lever around 80 times. Note in the lower level of the diagram, that the non-drug lever is hardly ever pressed. This is the acquisition phase, where the animal learns that a given lever is associated with a positive feeling, and it presses the lever again and again. In sessions two to 11, the animal takes about the same level of drug. It's called the maintenance phase, where there is no real change in the amount of lever presses, but the lever pressing to get the drug is maintained. In session twelve, the drug is withheld. This starts the extinction phase. As expected, there was little lever pressing in the following sessions because there's no drug reward. In Session 26, shown on the graph as E14, the animal is stressed in some way. Or is given an injection of cocaine by the investigator. This motivates the animal to start lever pressing again. A stress, or an activation of a drug memory, motivates the animal to go to the lever that previously gave a reward. This is called reinstatement, and is similar to what, we, we refer to as relapse in humans. These four phases of drug self-administration can be studied separately, if we wish, to more precisely define and study the stages of drug use. This gives you an idea of how drug self-administration can be utilized. It's a very powerful approach that has yielded a great deal of information, that's helped us combat drug abuse in humans.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/fo4ZI/animals-in-drug-addiction-research","Animals in Drug Addiction Research","Today we are going to talk about the use of animals in research. Because drug addiction is such an important problem in public health, it's very important that we study it so that we can both understand it and develop effective treatments for it. Also, before involving humans in studies, positive data must be obtained with animals to support and justify involving humans. As with any disease, animals play an essential and important role in solving the problem. Ultimately, humans must be involved in these studies in some ways, but it is unethical to give a person who has never had drugs before an addicting drug. There's a danger of creating a drug abuser or an addict. Therefore, a reasonable decision is to use animals in research, but under very strict and enforced rules that maximize the care of the animals. The results obtained in studies involving animals are very reliable. This is because the overall health, environment, diet, and treatments of the animals can be carefully controlled. We can't always say this for human subjects. Because of these advantages, the results from studies with animals can be especially informative. We know that there are many successes derived from using animals in research, and advances are continually being made with animals. We always want to be sure that animals in research receive adequate care. Before any experimental study can be done, the entire experimental plan must be described in detail in writing and approved by a knowledgeable committee. The committee will require that the study be, be beneficial and nontrivial. The committee will also require that discomfort to the animals be minimized. And the committee members are trained to evaluate this important aspect. Every experimental plan must include veterinary care for the animals at every stage. Laboratories are inspected by regulators to ensure that appropriate animal care and use procedures are being followed. Approval to use animals in research requires that the information derived from the work be important and relevant. Keeping this in mind, the best animal models should produce the following. First, they should produce results that are similar to those that have been previously found in humans. This validates the model. Second, they should produce results that are exprect, expected to apply to humans in the future. And third, they could be used to explain the underlying brain mechanisms that cause addiction. The laboratory investigators who are responsible for the research are almost always PhD-level scholars, who are highly trained and work at the cutting edge of drug abuse research. They're also trained in the care and use of animals. And not only are they trained in the care and use of animals, they are tested on it and then regularly retested. Their laboratories must have regular veterinary assistance available and the laboratories must be properly equipped so that the studies are not wasteful and the discomfort of animals is minimized. In summary, the use of animals in research is controlled, requires training, study and a supportive environment, and is allowed only if nontrivial benefits can reasonably be expected. There are several animal models that we will explore. One is called drug self-administration and the other is called conditioned place preference. These are highly effective and useful animal models that have significantly advanced the field. They have added to our knowledge of the addiction process and have helped identify new treatments for drug abusers. They are also used to test if various new medications might themselves be addicting. They will continue to help us in the future. [BLANK_AUDIO]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/VodtJ/review-of-ten-classes-of-drugs","Review of Ten Classes of Drugs","There are many reasons that we divide drugs into classes. It's convenient to do so, and it helps provide some insight. For example, if we discover something about a given drug, then we need to consider it for other members of that class. If a successful treatment is discovered for a drug. Then it may apply to other members, of that class. Of course, these reasons may not hold for the last class of drugs, which is a catch all, and is made up of substances that may not fit everywhere else. That's the class of drugs called, others. Pending on the drug, the frequency of drug use can vary from a few percent in our survey to over 80%. Inhalants are just over 8%. Caffeine isn't even listed in this survey, but because it's found in so many different products, it's likely to be close to 100%. As we've seen, addicting drugs can be amazingly different. Some are legal while others are not. Some are stimulants, and some are depressants. Some improve function in some ways, and others don't. Some are gases, and some are solids. A few don't even produce a high. But all these drugs change the brain, so that there's a craving and repeated use in spite of negative consequences. Frequently, there are ad, additional serious toxicities, of theses drugs. These differences can be seen among the drugs that we've considered this week, inhalants, caffeine and the others. The inhalants are gases or fumes that get the user high. After prolonged use, they can produce almost a whole body toxicity. Caffeine is considered a mild stimulant that can become a problem for some. Drugs in the other class, can have many different toxicities, depending on the drug [SOUND] let's go over some of the basic ideas about drugs that we talked about, in previous weeks. First of all, drugs have to enter the brain to have an effect. The amount of drug that gets into the brain, is due to a balance among absorption, metabolism, and excretion. Remember that? Drugs act in existing systems in the brain. In this sense, the brain is a co-conspirator, in addiction. These existing systems are, except in rare cases, neurotransmitter systems. An example is cocaine. Which interacts with the neurotransmitter, dopamine. Cocaine blocks the transporter, and by doing so, increases dopamine levels in the synapse and at dopamine receptors. This initial molecular action, ultimately affects the neuronal circuitry in the brain. And the various brain regions, such that addiction eventually occurs. A key thing to remember about drugs is that, while they are very much like neurotransmitters, because they're active in the brain, they are also, very different. We can care neurotransmitters versus drugs. In neurotransmission, the duration of action of the neurotransmitter on the synapse and at receptors. It's very brief. It's just fractions of a second. But when it comes to drugs. They're in the brain for a long time, more like minutes and hours. The levels and distribution of neurotransmitters are controlled by brain mechanisms. On the other hand, the presence and distribution of drugs are determined by the drug user. It's a result of how much drug the user takes and how often, he or she takes it. Neurotransmission is a normal process. It's the basis of every thought, idea, and action that we have. But drugs distort this normal process. For example, the brain can remove neurotransmitters from the synapse very quickly. But the brain has no evolved mechanism for removing drugs from the synapse. For these reasons, drugs distort brain function. This distortion ultimately causes addiction, by mechanisms that we don't yet, fully and completely, understand. Another important factor about drugs that we discussed is that they can act at multiple receptor sites. Because different receptors are found in different brain regions, each drug can have multiple and different effects. This image shows how a molecule can bind to different sites. By presenting different aspects of its molecular shape. This particular image is just made up for purposes of conveying the idea, rather than being perfectly accurate. All of this information will hopefully help, put the drugs that we've discussed in perspective. Please examine the review questions at the end of this lecture, and be able to identify the naturally occurring neurotransmitter systems in the brain, that each class of drug acts through. Also, please be able to identify some of the major toxicities of each class of drug. For example, marijuana impairs functioning. Caffeine is a mild stimulant, but when taken in excess, it can elevate blood pressure, cause a tremor, and produce a nervousness, that can interfere with functioning.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/rkQDw/new-and-other-substances","New and Other Substances","We have completed discussion of nine of the ten classes of drugs. Today, we discuss the last class, that's referred to as other. This class contains things that don't quite fit in the first nine classes. And it's also intended to include new drugs that come up from time to time that also may not fit into other classes. Some of the substances that are included in this class include the anabolic steroids and natural products, such as betel nuts, kava, and khat. It also includes newer compounds and materials with valuable composition, such as bath salts. This image shows the chemical structures of two kinds of compounds that would fit into this class. The anabolic steroids are derivatives of testosterone. And mephedrone is a compound found in bath salts. Let's discuss these two examples further. Anabolic steroids include synthetic substances related to male sex hormones like testosterone. These substances promote growth of skeletal muscle, hence their use by athletes and body builders. They also promote growth of male sexual characteristics. The receptors for anabolic steroids are the testosterone receptors. Anabolic steroi, steroids are well known to have adverse health consequences. These include a wide range of effects from abnormal breast development in men, to heart attacks and liver cancer. There is sometimes an alteration of hormonal systems, causing for example, testicular shrinkage. They can also promote skin problems, like acne. The issues with anabolic steroids are recognized. For example, their use in sports is prohibited. Anabolic steroids also are abused and can cause addiction. They're somewhat unique in that they don't cause a high, but nevertheless some users continue to seek and take these substances despite physical problems and other negative effects. Users also spend a lot of money to get these drugs. As one would expect, there are withdrawal symptoms. These include mood swings, fatigue, restlessness, steroid cravings, and depression. And the withdrawal symptoms can persist for long time, up to a year. Another example for this class of drugs is the so-called bath salts. As you would guess, they have nothing to do with bathing. Rather they are an emerging group of drugs related to stimulants such as amphetamine, cathinone, and ecstasy. More specifically, bath salts may include compounds like mephedrone and pyrovalerone. These can produce stimulant and sometimes hallucinogenic effects. They are believed to have addiction liability and their safety is questionable. The compounds that are contained in bath salts were self-administered in rats, suggesting that they can easily be an addiction problem in humans. Human users report that the drugs produce an intensive craving and that they are highly addictive. Many of the substances have already been made illegal. Let me summarize what we've said about this catchall class of drugs. Even if drugs don't get you high or euphoric they can still promote seeking and using in spite of distress and negative consequences. The example of this is the anabolic steroids. From time to time new substances are found that are sometimes not illegal. However, they are often related to existing, abused, and toxic drugs. Unfortunately, the relative safety of these newer substances is often not fully known. This lack of knowledge can create treatment difficulties, especially in emergencies. The safest position to take is to avoid the use of these substances.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/tho1P/caffeine","Caffeine","Today we're going to talk about a substance that most of us use every day, and that substance is caffeine. Caffeine is well known to be a mild stimulant. Many people take in the morning to get themselves going, as they say. It's perhaps the most widely used psychoactive drug in the world. Psychoactive means that it alters the way your mind functions. It's found in a lot of plants, and there is evidence that it produces abuse, tolerance and addiction. Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, sodas, chocolate, energy drinks, and many other things. If you're used to taking caffeine all the time, and you haven't had it for a day or so, you will probably experience some withdrawal. At that time, the effects of caffeine could be calming because your satisfying the withdrawal syndrome. But if you're having caffeine frequently, and you're taking higher doses, you may very well experience more severe effects due to the immediate effects of caffeine. These include restlessness, nervousness, insomnia, frequent urination, G.I. disturbance, muscle twitching; a fast heart rate or a tachycardia, and other things. After prolonged daily use of caffeine, and after stopping it abruptly, or reducing its use significantly, the following may occur within 24 hours. Headache, fatigue or drowsiness, a disphoric or unpleasant mood. Depression, irritability, and you may have difficulty concentrating. It is believed that the effects of caffeine intake and the signs and symptoms of withdrawal can cause significant distress or impairment in various areas of your life, including social and occupational activities. A survey revealed that 14% used caffeine despite harm, and despite advice to stop or resto, or reduce it's use. 45%, reported failed efforts to control it's use. Thus, caffeine has many of the properties of other drugs that are abused and cause addiction. You know that drugs of abuse are typically associated with altering a specific neurotransmitter system in the brain. What neurotransmitter does caffeine interact with? Well, it's a neurotransmitter called adenosine. Caffeine is an antagonist at two of several adenosine GPR receptors. Ultimately, it increases dopamine activity in the brain as well. Because caffeine is an antagonist or blocker of adenosine, caffeine's actions are opposite to those of adenosine. The neurotransmitter adenosine is involved in inhibiting release of other neurotransmitters, reducing excitation and convulsions, depressing locomotor activity, and inhibiting the actions of the heart. Just as we can treat our dependence on other drugs, we can treat caffeine overuse. A reasonable plan for caffeine addiction is as follows. First, you should be made aware of the sources of caffeine. Then you need to generate an awareness of caffeine intake by record keeping. Once you're aware of how much caffeine you're taking in, then you can determine a maximal intake goal, which could be zero, perhaps with a health professional. Then you can gradually reduce the intake of caffeine til you reach your goal. Throughout this, it can be helpful to participate in counseling to help with and support this overall process. While caffeine is only a mild stimulant, very available and widely used, it nevertheless has been associated with health problems. Patients have also found it difficult to stop, and they exhibit many of the characteristics of being dependent and addicted. [BLANK_AUDIO]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/xbQKE/inhalants","Inhalants","This program is brought to you by Emory University. >> Today I'm going to talk about the inhalants. I won't be able to discuss all of the inhalants, but I'll select some so that you will gain an understanding about this group of substances. Inhalants are usually liquids or gasses and the fumes are inhaled for their effects. They're found in paints, glues, fuels, and many other products. These substances are legal, very available, and they have rapid effects. Surveys show that a significant number of people use these drugs. Unfortunately, they are addicting and quite dangerous, particularly after long-term use. The inhalants are a very diverse group of substances. It's because they are classified not on the pharmacological properties, not on the receptors that they stimulate, but on the fact that they are volatile and gaseous. Therefore, they will have different properties and mechanisms depending on the substance we're considering. Our first group includes the solvents, which are found in many materials including glue, paints, paint thinners, and motor fuels. Nitrous Oxide, an anaesthetic gas, is a widely abused inhalant. Outside of medical and dental practices, it's found in whipped cream chargers and it does cause laughing, hence it's name, laughing gas. Another group of inhalants include the alkyl nitrites that are found in room deodorizers. Other inhalants are found in propellants like hairspray, and in fuels like cigarette lighter fluid. This image shows the chemical structures of some of the inhalants. As I said, many are readily available and include Toluene, which is very common. Trichloroethylene, ether, nitrous oxide, and others. We can look at the inhalants as a class and make some general comments about their acute effects. By acute I mean first time effects. First, there is an excitation, which many refer to as a rush. This is then followed by depression. They produce an apparent drunkenness caused by disruption of mental processes, loss of coordination, and slurred speech. They irritate the eyes and the lungs, and higher concentrations can produce hallucinations, seizures, a coma, and even death. A rare but lethal condition that can occur even after a single first use is something called sudden sniffing death. It's believed to be due to cardiac arrhythmias and stress, if this occurs it can be quite a shock to a family in a group. These can be very dangerous substances. Anesthetics, another group of inhalants, produce a relaxation, anesthesia, and amnesia. One can imagine that these effects would reduce stressful feelings felt by the user for whatever reason. As we have said previously, stress is a common factor in drug abuse. Having discussed the acute effects, we can now consider the effects that are found after long term use of the inhalants. General long term effects of inhalants are very serious. They include brain damage resulting in shrinkage of some areas. Brain imaging has shown this. There's also damage to the bones, heart, kidneys, and lungs, and an increase in the risk for many other illnesses. There's great concern about these toxicities, given that inhalants are often abused by children and adolescents. How do inhalants work? Well, as I mentioned, this is a very diverse class of drugs. And because of that, there are many different mechanisms that we have to consider. Different drugs have different mechanisms. Toluene, a very commonly used inhalant found in paints and paint thinners, causes a generalized depression of the brain, mainly by inhibiting excitatory neuro, neurotransmitter receptors. And by enhancing inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors. There may be actions of other receptors as well. When we're considering the anesthetics, many enhance inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors such as GABA-A and Glycine receptors. Nitrous Oxide is also thought to inhibit the excitatory neurotransmitter receptor, the NMDA receptor. So it's clear that these substances have a variety of actions. Although for some, there are common themes in their actions. A common theme is the reduction or blockade of excitation, and the enhancement or the increasing of inhibition at synapses in the brain. Treatment is of course available for those abusing inhalants. Because of the serious nature of the long term effects of the drugs, stopping use is obviously beneficial. Although treatment's available, there are no proven treatment medications specific for inhalant abuse at this time. Therefore, an important approach is to treat the symptoms and signs that occur with each specific inhalant in each patient, including counseling with education about the substances. As with many drug abusers, there are often coexisting mental or physical problems in a given patient. Treatment programs for the addict should include addressing these other co-existing mental and physical disorders. We can close by restating what I said at the beginning of the lecture. Inhalants are easily obtained, easily, easily used, but addicting and very toxic. Cessation of use is most important.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/pj6x0/neurotransmission-brain-imaging-review","Neurotransmission & Brain Imaging Review","This past week we have covered a lot of important material. Let me go over the key points and key conclusions. First, we connected the neurotransmitter dopamine with reward, or feeling good, and therefore with survival. We've also shown that an increase in synaptic dopamine levels occur in response to cocaine and other drugs. We've discussed that a dopaminergic pathway, the mesolimbic circuit, is a pathway that mediates reward. Having knowledge of the specific neuronal areas that contain dopamine, helps us study dopamine and drugs more effectively. The nucleus accumbens is one of these regions. We consider dopamine as a mediator of feeling good for natural process that are rewarded. One of these was mating. We pointed out that drugs and sexual activity both release dopamine in the same brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens. From the perspective of the brain, the brain gets the same dopamine signal whether the animal is mating or taking drugs. Theoretically, the brain will reinforce both behaviors. We can postulate that drugs are powerful partly because they trick the brain into thinking that you just did something important for survival, which was mating, and the brain therefore makes you feel good. In other words, drugs act at very powerful motivating circuits, which presumably underlies why we can be driven to take more and more drugs. I've pointed out that dopamine is not the entire story in drug addiction. It is an important modulator of reward. But it is not the only neurotransmitter in reward. Dopamine does not simply equal reward, but probably something more complicated. Data suggests that dopamine is involved in attracting attention to a variety of stimuli. And this is a current frontier in research. Nevertheless, dopamine is an important part of the addiction picture, and I've used as an example of how a neurotransmitter can be intimately involved in the effects of drugs. Then we move down to brain imaging. Because brain imaging shows what drugs do to the brain in living humans, and how brains heal after the user abstains from drugs. The example of a brain imaging technique that we use is PET scanning or Positron Emission Tomography. Much has come out of this approach. For example, we showed that one of the dopamine receptors, the D2 receptor, is changed, or reduced, in people who have taken drugs for a long time. And further, that it takes a very long time for those dopamine receptors to return to normal. When people stop taking drugs. I'm talking about months to years. This slow rate of healing of the brain, after stopping drug use, has important implications. Everyone involved with drug users, including the patients, family, supporters, treatment staff and others, need to be aware of this long healing time. They can't expect miracles from short treatments. A long term successful treatment may have some relapses and require several intensive treatment periods. There are many success stories out there. Treatment does work. So it's clear that chronic drug taking changes the chemical makeup of the brain. We've also shown that taking drug for long periods of time can result in greater numbers of brain regions being affected by drugs. The data says that drugs, when they're taken repeatedly, recruit and influence more and more regions of the brain. As we've said many times, the brain on drugs is really a different brain. It's clear that drugs change the brain, which is why behavior changes. But how do drugs change the brain? It's time to address this question, question. The answer is complex, but very, very interesting. From a general perspective, the brain is neuroplastic. It can change its structure signaling gene expression, and other things. There are many mechanisms of this neuroplasticity. Learning and forgetting, or recovery from brain damage, are common forms of neuroplasticity, and that shows how important neuroplasticity really is. What are the cellular and molecular changes that mediate neuroplasticity? We can consider changes in gene expression as something that happens with repeated drug taking. One way to change gene expression is to activate or deactivate transcription factors. Transcription factors are needed to turn on a gene. So that, our protein is ultimately made from the gene. Neurotransmitter signalling mechanisms, whether they are turned by a neurotransmitter or by a drug, result in intracellular changes and activations of transcriptions factors. This is a big picture slide. It describes that drugs alter neurotransmission, and that altered neurotransmission results in altered intracellular signalling, which results in altered activations of transcription factors. Which as I said, results, results in changes in proteins that are produced by the cell. This is one way that drugs change the chemistry and functioning of the brain. Overall this is a lot of material, but a lot of very important material. A good way to review would be to go over again, all of the review questions from each of the lectures given this week.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/s44aS/how-drugs-alter-gene-expression-signaling-and-epigenetics","How Drugs Alter Gene Expression: Signaling and Epigenetics","Throughout the course we've mentioned many times, that drugs change the brain. We've seen examples with the D2 dopamine receptor, where drugs reduce the levels of receptors. To understand how this happens, we need to consider some of the most basic processes in biology. The making of proteins from DNA and RNA, and gene regulation. Genes, which code for proteins, are found in the DNA. And their activity is regulated, as will be described later. This image shows that the DNA double helix is a template for producing the mRNA. This is referred to as transcription and splicing. Splicing ensures that the RNA is of the correct length. Then the RNA is translated into a protein, such as a dopamine receptor. But transcription is controlled and regulated. This is the basic idea of what we'll consider today. Let's look at a couple of examples. One way, one way of regulating gene expression, which ultimately results in regulating protein levels is by neurotransmitter reduction. Or signaling for short. Signaling means that the neurotransmitter is a signal that is converted by acting through a receptor to a series of biochemical changes within the next neuron. This extends the material from the second week of our lectures. In week two, we talked about different kinds of neurotransmitter receptors. We mentioned ion channel receptors and GPCRs. G protein coupled receptors. Today, we'll focus on GPCRs because of the interesting and various ways they can act or signal to the neuronal cell body and the nucleus, and the DNA, and regulate genes. GPCRs or G protein-coupled receptors are receptor proteins that are specific for a given or a given neurotransmitter, or some related drug, as are all receptors. But attached to the receptor protein on the inside of the neuron, is the trimeric G-protein. Trimeric means that the G-protein is composed of three subunits, the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. Here's a simplified view of the receptor protein in the neuronal membrane. It's a long protein that crosses the neuronal membrane seven times. The part of the protein that is within the membrane is referred to as the transmembrane domain. The neurotransmitter, which is an agonist, has a unique binding region on this receptor. On the inside of the neuron, there was a binding place for the trimeric G-protein. This schematic shows the receptor, which crosses the membrane seven times. It is the continuous up and down line which represents the crossing and recrossing of the membrane. The membrane itself is not shown, but you can see the trimeric G-protein with its alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, which are inside the cell. Also, the G-protein is shown with a GDP molecule attached to it, which in fact implies the name the G-protein. Now this is where it gets interesting. The next two things that happen, are that the neurotransmitter binds to the receptor. The neurotransmitter is shown as an asterisk on the seven transmembrane protein. Also, the GDP molecule is exchanged for a GTP molecule. The G-protein is now activated and ready to go to work. The G-protein subunits move away from the receptor and off into the neuron, and the subunits activate various processes. The GTP alpha portion can activate an enzyme, a kinase for example, and the beta gamma portion can affect various other proteins as well. When the subunits finish their activations and processes, then the GTP is converted to GDP, and the configuration returns to exactly how it started. The complex is now ready to go again. Given that there are many different G-proteins and many processes within the cell that are affected by G-proteins, there's a marvelous richness and a variety of G-protein signaling that can occur. What are the results of G-protein activations that apply to addiction? There are many, but one that we'll consider today is the regulation of transcription factors. Transcription factors are regulators of gene expression. But their activity is also regulated, partly by a GPCR. Whether the activation of the GPCR is by neuro-transmitters or drugs. So what is a transcription factor? A transcription factor is a protein such as jun, fos, or creb. That is needed to bind to the regulatory region of DNA, to help translate or express the genetic message in DNA, into RNA and proteins. The regulatory region of the DNA is exactly that. It's a region that needs specific proteins to turn it on, or sometimes off. So the DNA is controlled by a group of proteins that include transcription factors. A common effect of G-protein signaling is to activate transcription factors by phosphorylation. Once the G-proteins, though kinases, activate the transcription factors, the transcription factors can bind to the regulatory regions of the DNA, and levels of RNA and protein in the cell can be changed. This is another image showing the process where transcription factors and other proteins, such as RNA polymerase II, bind to the regulatory region of a gene and increased transcription, or the making of messenger RNA. This is a big picture image. It shows the nerve terminal synapsing on a post-synaptic neuron. The nerve terminal is releasing neurotransmitter onto post-synaptic receptors, which through interneuronal signaling are changing the activity of proteins and causing phosphorylation. Note that drugs can also affect neurotransmission, and produce the same changes. Let's review the sequence of transcription factor activation. First, neurotransmitter receptors and G-proteins are activated by a neurotransmitter or drug. Then a G-protein subunit activates a Kinase. And the Kinase is an enzyme that adds phosphate groups to proteins. The activated Kinases may act on other proteins that ultimately activate a transcription factor by, by phosphorylation. The activated transcription factor binds to a gene regulatory site with other proteins. Which alters gene expression. Which ultimately alters protein levels. Please note that activated G-proteins can do many things besides activate transcription factors. We're only considering transcription factors as relevant examples of what they can do. But this, this sequence gives you an idea of how neurotransmitters can change gene expression and the protein makeup of the brain. Changing the protein makeup of the brain, which is the organ of behavior, can have functional and behavioral effects, which underly addiction. Signal transduction by neurotransmitters is a normal process for normal functioning of the brain. But, as we've mentioned, drugs insert themselves into these pathways, dominate the neurotransmitter, and change the way neurotransmitters function. Said another way, neurotransmitters and their systems endow the brain with a neuroplasticity. They can influence protein levels through signal transduction. But drugs can upset the normal balance of neurotransmitter signaling in a given nerve circuit, and induce a neuroplasticity of their own. Because drugs can alter the protein makeup of the brain, they can produce changes in the brain metabolism, structure, and behavior. Before I leave the topic of how drugs can alter gene expression, I want to mention another mechanism called epigenetics. Epigenetics has become very important. It includes mechanisms for altering gene expression. One of these mechanisms is to methylate, or add methyl groups to the genes in DNA. The methylation blocks the gene so that it can't be transcribed or copied. Another epigenetic mechanism is to acetylate histones, so that the DNA can't be expressed or copied. I'm not going to go into epigenetics in more detail. However, I have added supplemental material which can give you an idea of what epigenics, epigenetics is about. It would make an excellent independent study.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/LAbV9/neuroplasticity-how-drugs-change-the-brain","Neuroplasticity & How Drugs Change the Brain","Today, we're going to continue to talk about how drugs change the brain. Specifically, we're going to talk about the fact that chronic drug taking influences more brain regions, more areas of the brain, than brief drug taking. Later today, we're also going to talk about the meaning of a very important word in addiction, which is neuroplasticity. There are many ways to look at how drugs change the brain. One is a brain imaging approach called the glucose utilization. I've mentioned glucose utilization before. It's possible to measure glucose utilization throughout the brain. The brain regions that are most active will have more glucose utilization. It's very interesting to look at changes in brain glucose utilization induced by drugs. Consider the following experiment. There are two groups of monkeys, and one group is allowed to self-administer cocaine for a short period of time. And there's another group that will self-administer cocaine for a long period of time. Then glucose utilization is measured in the brains of these groups of animals. As you can guess, differences were found between the two groups of monkeys. Specifically, the differences were in the number of brain regions influenced by drugs. In the group of monkeys that had only brief injections of cocaine, there was increased energy consumption in certain areas. That included areas we, we refer to as the caudate, and the nucleus accumbens. You've heard of the nucleus accumbens before as a reward center. But after chronic cocaine, more regions of the brain were activated. One of these was the putamen. Functionally, the putamen is involved in learning and reinforcement. And that makes sense. Those images clearly show that chronic drug taking changes not only the chemical make up of the brain in general terms, which we've discussed previously. But also the fact that chronic drugs affect more regions of the brain more profoundly. The key message is that, continued drug use has a progressively greater effect by recruiting and influencing more regions of the brain. Again, the brain on drugs really is a different brain. Now we're going to open up a critically important topic for addiction. How do drugs change the brain? It's time to address this question. The answer may be somewhat long and complex, but very interesting and important. We're going to look at cellular and molecular changes in the brain as the basis of drug addiction. Related to how drugs change the brain, we can be reminded that the brain is neuroplastic. This means that the brain can change in structure, signaling, gene expression, and in other ways. We'll examine some of these. Learning and forgetting, or recovery from brain damage, are common forms of neuroplasticity. And that points out how important neuroplasticity really is. Generally, neuroplastic changes strengthen or weaken signalling in specific neuronal circuits. This could be due to changes of the synapse, or to the formation of new synapses, or to other chemical changes in the neurone. The image shows one form of neuroplasticity, which is to change the dendrites and synapses on a given neurone. On the left, you can see a neuronal cell body with a few dendrites extending from it. On the right, you can see a neuronal cell body with more dendritic extensions, and many dots indicating the presence of new synapses. This has been observed experimentally. And, it is one of the ways that drugs can alter the brain. That is by changing the shape and structure, and ultimately the function of neurones. This familiar image shows the process of neurotransmission. Mechanisms of neuroplasticity could include altering the amount of neurotransmitter released, changing the number of receptors on a post synaptic cell, or changing signaling molecules inside the neurone, which aren't shown here. But let's focus on one of the many possibilities. Let's focus on changes in gene expression. Which is very useful when talking about how drugs work. It will help explain how drugs change the brain in the most fundamental way. Drug induced neuroplasticity can be accomplished by activating transcription factors, or by epigenetic mechanisms. We'll discuss transcription factors, and epigenetic mechanisms, and signalling in more detail in the next lecture. Let's summarize for today. Drugs change the brain, and we can talk about neuroplasticity in this context. The craving and compulsions induced by drugs are based in neuroplasticity. The brain is the organ of behavior. Changes in behavior are based on changes in the brain. Finding and understanding these brain changes help us target those areas and mechanisms for potential new treatment strategies. For example, can we find medications that might reverse some of these drug induced changes? We'll see. Hence, neuroplasticity needs to be a part of our vocabulary, and a topic of our focus.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/uJIip/dopamine-receptors-in-vulnerability-healing","Dopamine Receptors in Vulnerability & Healing","While we agree that dopamine is not the only important neurotransmitter in the brain, it's clear that looking at dopamine will tell us a great deal about drugs and reward. PET imaging can measure several components of the dopamine system in the brain, and one of these, for example, is the D2 dopamine receptor. PET can also measure energy metabolism, or glucose metabolism. The brain regions that are more active have greater metabolism. This image shows D2 dopamine receptors in the brains of both normal subjects and in those withdrawing from cocaine. The two different levels, or slices, of the brain from the same subject, are shown on the right, and the left. The levels of the receptors are reflected in the brightness of the regions. Brighter means more receptors. The bright, bilateral curved regions with the receptors within the brain are what's known as the basal ganglia. The top row of two slices or levels, show data for a normal subject, and the next two rows show data for cocaine users abstaining from drug for one and four months. The finding, which you can readily see, is that drug use is associated with lower D2 dopamine receptor levels, and that the return to normal is very slow, requiring months or longer. It's clear from what we know about neurotransmission, that changes in the level of receptors can have functional effects, and drug use changes dopamine neurotransmission. The slow return to normal indicates that the brain takes a long time to heal after drug use. For the first time, we have a hard biochemical measure of the rate of healing in the living human brain, which is made possible by imaging. While it is slow, there is healing. Staying away from drugs does promote healing, even though it takes a long time. These are very encouraging and hopeful data. We can examine the same time course of abstinence by looking at a different kind of PET scan, the PET scan of glucose utilization. The top left image shows a normal level of glucose utilization under these conditions. The top right shows glucose utilization after ten days of abstinence from cocaine. And the bottom shows en, energy metabolism after a 100 days of withdrawal. Again, using a different measure here, we see that it takes a long time for the brain to return to normal. As I said, I think that this has been an important discovery. What are the implications of a slow rate of healing? Well obviously, everyone involved with the drug user, including family, supporters, and treatment staff need to be aware of the long healing time. They can't expect miracles from short treatments. A successful treatment will have to continue in time, and because individuals vary, the duration of treatment may vary also. The drug user may have some relapses and require several treatment periods, but many people believe the brain eventually totally heals. The data show that it is gradually reversing towards normal. These findings and other considerations suggest that low levels of D2 dopamine reflect, receptors reflect a vulnerability to addiction in general. The image here shows D2 receptors for cocaine, which you've already seen, and those for methamphetamine and alcohol. Again, for all these drugs, and not just for cocaine, the levels of D2 dopamine receptors are reduced. What about other kinds of excessive activity that can have negative consequences and may be addicting? D2 receptor scans of obese subjects also show a reduction in D2 dopamine receptors. In gambling, D2 dopamine receptors correlate with the personality trait of impulsiveness, which is a broad measure of vulnerability to addiction. Lower levels of receptors suggest greater urgency for impulsiveness. Let me summarize. Dopamine systems in brain have been implicated in drug reward. PET scans reveal that the D2 dopamine receptor levels tend to be lower in drug users and in other kinds of vulnerable subjects. After abstinence, D2 levels return slowly towards normal. It may takes months to years, to become normal. This slow return has important implications for treatment and recovery. Do the low levels of reflec, of receptors reflect a deficiency in the reward system? Perhaps yes.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/aAy84/brain-imaging-pet-scanning","Brain Imaging & PET Scanning","Before we can fix or cure drug addiction, it would help to know what's broken. We can get some information by looking at the chemistry of brain schematics after they've died, at a postmortem autopsy. When we do that, it's clear that the brains of addicts are changed. Understanding these chemical changes, what they mean, and what we can do about them is a current frontier. It will not be easy because there are many changes that occur in the brain, and we may have to take into account a large number of them simultaneously to really understand the nature of drug addiction. But this analysis is ongoing. While postmortem analysis is very informative, there are other powerful ways to get information. Brain imaging allows brain measurements in a living human being. Brain imaging is routine now, but 30 years ago it looked as if it was magical, and it really still is. Brain imaging has been very successful in providing important information not only in addiction, but in every field involving the brain. There are different kinds of brain imaging. There are different technologies that tell us different things. There is PET, which stands for positron emission tomography. PET, P-E-T, is useful for a number of things. It can measure metabolism in various brain regions, the levels of specific proteins, such as receptors, in various brain regions, and it can do more. MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, measures the structure, volume and shape of the brain. FMR, or functional magnetic resonance, is used to measure the relative activity of various brain regions. And there are yet other kinds of brain imaging. I'm going to focus on PET scanning as an example. It'll help you understand the kind of effort that goes into brain imaging and what we can learn. The diagram shows all of the basic features and instrumentation of PET scanning. Let's look at them one by one. PET imaging requires the injection of specific radioactive compounds. These specially prepared compounds contain positron-emitting atoms. When a positron is emitted by an atomic nucleus, it eventually combines with an electron, which is its antimatter particle, and two gamma rays result from this combination that we call an annihilation. The gamma rays shoot off in opposite directions and the image portrays this. This is the basic mechanism, and why it is called positron emission tomography. The subject to be studied is given an injection of a positron-emitting compound. The exact compound that's given depends on the kind of measurement you're making, or on the kind of brain pro, protein that you want to detect and measure. The two gamma rays resulting from the annihilation are detected by a circular array of detectors, shown in the image. The data from the detectors are analyzed by computers and then in images reconstructed and displayed. The data and the image can be processed and analyzed in many useful ways. PET data are usually viewed as slices through the brain, which is what tomography is. The slices can be in different orientations depending on the structure of interest, as is shown in the image. Slicing in the coronal or horizontal planes is most common. Here's an assignment. Do an Internet search on brain atlases. Look through them and try to get comfortable with different views of brain slices. If you have difficulty with this, please do not worry because the meaning of the images that I'll be showing to you will be easy to understand. Now, just an interesting caution, the images we see in PET scanning do not directly show the structure of the brain. The PET images show the distribution of radioactivity in the brain, which can suggest the shape of the brain slice. In this image on the left, you see what a slice through the head, at the level of the eyeballs, would look like by the normal eye. No radioactivity shown. But on the right is a PET image of the distribution of D2 dopamine receptors. The receptors have a positron-emitting substance selectively bound to them, thus measuring the radioactivity reflects the presence of receptors. The intensity of the color parallels the level of the dopamine receptors. Brighter color equals more receptors. But the structure of the brain, its tissue, is not shown as it is on the left. The receptors are shown within the structure, and the structure can sort of be seen even though it's not being explicitly shown. Now, let's visit an actual PET imaging facility. Here we are at a PET center with all of the instrumentation that's need to carry out these measurements. Here is the PET scanner. You can see the platform that the subjects lie down on. It's motorized and can be moved in and out of the detector apparatus. The detector apparatus is this large panel part that the heads of the subjects fit into. Behind these panels is the circular array of detectors that I talked about earlier. So, this is how it works. A subject compatible with an important experiment is chosen. The subject receives an injection of a radiolabeled substance that travels to the brain and that emits a positron. The nature of the substance, as you know, will depend on what we're measuring in the brain. The material that's injected is made in a very special area that we call the hot cell area. Because we're dealing with radioactivity, the synthesis of these compounds and substances is done very, very carefully and according to very strict regulations. It's done remotely by radiochemists who control the synthesis of these substances from a remote station. The total amount of radioactivity that a subject receives is very low, however. It will not do any damage to the subject. While a subject can go through this procedure more than once, there's a limit on the amount of radioactivity that a single subject can be exposed to in a given amount of time. In any case, this is all worked out very nicely and very safely, and great deal of useful information has been obtained from this procedure. After there's, the injection, the subject is moved into the scanner, and here's an example, and the radioactivity coming from the brain is recorded by this apparatus. Then the computers take all of the image data and reconstruct three-dimensionally in space, where the radioactivity's coming from. Basically, this will show what part of the brain contains the radioactive emitter, and how much radioactivity is there. Overall, this is an amazing instrumentation. In the early 1980s, I was lucky enough to be a senior member of the team at the Johns Hopkins University's School of Medicine, that developed this approach for measuring drug receptors in the human brain. I was also fortunate enough to play a role in identifying the dopamine transporter as the cocaine receptor, which has also been imaged using PET. Those discoveries have had a significant impact in understanding what happens when people become addicted. In the following lectures, we will review some of the discoveries around drug addition that came from PET studies.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/QtMXs/dopamine-natural-rewards","Dopamine & Natural Rewards","The purposes of today's lecture are as follows. First to relate dopamine to natural activities that are rewarding. Second, to use sexual activity as an example. Third, to show how dopamine release occurs for both drugs and certain natural activities. Fourth, to discuss the power of drugs over behavior. And fifth, to caution everyone that dopamine is not the entire story of reward, but an important part of drugs and reward. So now, let's consider dopamine as a mediator, or modulator, of reward for a natural activity. The natural activity that we're going to examine as an example, is sexual activity or mating behavior. Here is the image shown previously that includes data from hundreds of experiments on reward centers in brain. It shows that one of the dopamine-containing systems, the mesolimbic dopamine system, is at least part of the reward system. And we know from the last lecture that we can measure dopamine release and levels from these regions. We mentioned that cocaine administration results in an elevation of synaptic dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. Here again, we show a laboratory rat, with a very small probe placed in the brain, that helps us measure dopamine levels. This arrangement was used in a previous experiment, to verify that cocaine blocks the dopamine transporter, and results in a massive synaptic increase in dopamine levels. Now we're going to look at the effect of a rewarding natural activity. An activity that makes one feel good and rewarded, and it's effect on dopamine levels in reward circuitry. In this interesting experiment, we have a probe implanted into the brain of a male rat. And we're going to follow the levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens during the exposure of this male rat to a female rat. Dopamine levels are shown in relative terms, and in the first half hour or so, with the rat in its home cage, dopamine levels are approximately at the arbitrary level of 100. When the rat is moved into the test chamber, a novel environment, dopamine levels rise a little, and when the animal is exposed to the female and allowed to mate with the female, dopamine levels rise dramatically. After the female's removed, dopamine levels gradually fall back to normal levels. These data show that engaging in sexual activity causes an increase of synaptic dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. Remember this data? This shows that synaptic dopamine levels rise dramatically in the nucleus accumbens when cocaine is given. How interesting. Dopamine levels rise when engaging in sexual activity or after taking cocaine. From the point of view of dopamine receptors, and the downstream parts of the brain, the brain doesn't know whether you've just had cocaine or whether you've just engaged in sexual activity. The motivation to engage in sexual activity is very strong. It may very well be that one of the reasons that drugs have such power over our behavior in some cases, is because they affect the same systems as powerful, natural activities. Drugs can be as powerful as sexual activity, and many drug users say this. This seems to be an important discovery. Throughout this course, I've been dopamine a great deal. I've shown dopamine in the context of its being a neurotransmitter, talked about its five receptors, and now about its involvement in reward. However, I want to point out that dopamine is not simply the entire story. Dopamine is an important modulator of reward, but not the only factor in reward. There are many different neurotransmitters found in reward centers in the brain. Dopamine does not simply equal reward, but most likely something more complicated. It may be that dopamine is involved in attracting attention to a variety of stimuli. Nevertheless, again, dopamine is a very important part of the addiction picture. Let me summarize what we've talked about. Reward systems in the brain contribute to survival and are powerful because they have to be. The dopamine-containing mesolimbic circuit is one of the pathways involved in reward. Dopamine is related to both drug reward and natural rewards. Therefore, it is profitable to explore dopamine systems and drugs further. As I mentioned in the last lecture, this is what we plan to do. Please examine the review questions for this lecture.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/Am6cy/dopamine-reward-survival","Dopamine, Reward, & Survival","This program is brought to you by Emory University. [BLANK_AUDIO] The purposes of today's lecture are first, to connect the neurotransmitter, dopamine, with reward or feeling good processes and centers in brain. Second, to discuss the significance and importance of reward for survival. And third, to show that a re, release of dopamine occurs in response to cocaine and other drugs. You know that different brain regions have different functions. Feeling good or feeling rewarded are brain functions. Many such regions and circuits have been id, been identified, and it turns out that dopamine-containing neurons are in some of those regions. Before we talk about dopamine and reward, we can ask the most basic question of all. Why does reward exist? What purpose does feeling good have? Is its presence or evolution of meaningless, but pleasant, accident? Well, one can build a stronger argument that reward circuits in the brain are critical for the survival of our species. The idea is that reward circuits make us feel good when we do something for our survival. These include eating when hungry, drinking when thirsty, and engaging in sexual activities. We want to feel good, so we're motivated to do those things. Without reward circuits, one can claim that our survival would be threatened, or perhaps not possible. Further, you can argue that reward systems not only have to exist, but they have to be powerful because our survival is critical. Reward systems are not there for drugs. They're there for survival, according to these ideas. The implications that because drugs activate some of our very powerful reward systems, they very powerfully drive our behavior to repeatedly re-experience what feels good. It seems likely that drugs activate these centers by accident. At least some of these substances that activate can become addictive. These repeated efforts to re-experience what feels good leads to addiction in vulnerable people. The seeds of addiction are planted deep within our brain. We are, we are, by our nature, vulnerable to drugs. This image is the result of hundreds of experiments over many years. It's a schematic of the rat brain, showing some of the dopamine-containing neuronal circuits in the brain. The circles show specific brain regions, such as the nucleus accumbens, that receive dopamine-containing nerve terminals. Dopamine modulates the function connected with those regions. Another important part of this schematic is that it points out that the mesolimbic dopamine system is involved in reward. Not just drug reward, but other kinds of reward, including feeding, drinking and sexual activity. The linking of dopamine and reward is an important idea, and one of the foundations of current thinking in drug addiction research. Here again, is our dopamine and cocaine connection. Cocaine blocks the removal of dopamine from the synapse, thereby increasing the level of dopamine at the receptors, and increasing the stimulation of the receptors by dopamine. Behavioral studies, like drug self-administration, have shown that cocaine is rewarding. Its primary action is to inhibit the dopamine transporter. Thus, there is a clear dopamine-cocaine and dopamine-reward connection. Now, let's look at some of the experimental evidence for this. One of the kinds of experiments that we can perform routinely, is to measure the release of dopamine, and the levels of dopamine, in certain brain regions. To do this, a small probe is placed into a rat brain, for example, and this probe helps us measure dopamine levels in that area. The levels that it measures are the extracellular, or the synaptic levels of dopamine, which are the levels of dopamine that the receptors experience, not the dopamine inside the neurons. When cocaine, which is a rewarding stimulus, is given, dopamine levels dramatically increase. This diagram shows the relative levels of dopamine in a particular brain region, and the effect of cocaine on these levels. At early times before cocaine is given, the level of synaptic dopamine is relatively stable, shown at about 100. When cocaine is given, you can see that the level of cocaine dramatically increases, because the transporter is blocked. The removal of dopamine from extracellular spaces is block. But as cocaine levels fall, at around the ninth and tenth interval, the transporters regain their ability to function and dopamine levels begin to fall back to normal. But it's clear that cocaine causes an increase of extracellular dopamine and therefore, the cocaine-dopamine link is experimentally verified. Again, it is the extracellular levels that are connected to the receptors. So, cocaine causes a rise in dopamine levels, but what about other drugs? Well, it's been shown that cocaine is not the only drug that results in an increase in dopamine, in these very specific brain regions. Many experiments have shown that other drugs do it as well. They may not do it as directly as cocaine. Sometimes it may be more of an indirect action involving other neuronal circuits. But the classes of drugs that increase levels of dopamine include, the psychostimulants, which we've just seen because cocaine is a psychostimulant, opiates, ethanol, cannabinoids like THC, nicotine, caffeine and perhaps others. It's generally agreed that dopamine is an important regulator or modulator of drug reward. Because dopamine is involved in these very powerful reward systems that drugs affect, it is reasonable and important to study the effects of drugs on dopamine systems in brain. This is something that we will look at repeatedly in subsequent lectures.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/uJ301/prevention","Prevention","Having learned about vulnerability and risk factors, what do we do about them? Someone might question if we should do anything about risk factors. Maybe we should just worry about treating people who become addicts. After all, most people don't become addicts. Well there are many answers to this. One important answer is that, if we only worry about treatment, at the point where treatment is needed, significant damage may have already been done. The damage could be bad health, loss of a job and respect or even acquiring a prison record. One event can lead you down a damaging path. Therefore, paying attention to risk factors and trying to do something about them in advance of trouble is important. This is the field of prevention. Preventing and understanding risk factors is a key for preventing drug use. Again, what do we do about risk factors? What if we have many risk factors in our lives? What do we do next? If we have friends who have many risk factors, how do we counsel them? Let's look at what we can do about risk factors. First, knowing what the risk factors are can be helpful. Also, getting the help of a professional in assessing your risk factors could be useful. They had the knowledge and experience to guide you effectively. Risk factors are not all equal. Staying away from drugs is the ultimate prevention and is the most effective way to control your risk. This is under your control. And you can compensate for other even severe risk factors. Another way to deal with risk factors is to learn about and include protective factors in your live. Choose activities with good outcome, not negative ones. You can prevent risks, you can choose behaviors, associations and places that minimize your risk for drug use. If you are in a position of influence, a school principal for example or even a friend, or older sibling; try to prevent others from drug use. If necessary, get them professional help, educate them about drugs because education and prevention does help. Prevention programs in schools and governments costs money but study show that prevention programs actually save money overall. It costs seven to ten times more to treat addicts. Thus, prevention saves money. And it's clear that drug abuse is preventable. What are the key areas that prevention programs need to address? First, addiction often has it's roots in childhood in adolescence. Therefore, preventing drug use by, by youths may be especially effective. Promoting prevention programs and including education counseling is helpful. Also, we should support biological and social research that discovers risk factors. Prevention programs also should reverse risk, enhance positive factors. Be able to address all drug abuse, not just one situation or one drug. Be able to address a specific population with specific vulnerabilities, and suggest active interventions when needed. Prevention is a necessity. There are many important and effective prevention programs in this and other countries. We should take advantage of these programs. Particularly if we as individuals or as groups have vulnerabilities and risk factors for drug use. [BLANK_AUDIO] >> The preceding program is copyrighted by Emory University.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/X0AsR/protective-factors","Protective Factors","Just as there are risk factors, factors that increase your chances of being a drug abuser or addict, there are also protective factors, factors that reduce risk. Protective factors, broadly, can be biological, personal, or environmental. Also, actively compensating for bad risk factors can be protective. Some examples of biological protection are as follows. A mutation in an alcohol metabolizing enzyme, found in people of Asian extraction, makes people get sick from drinking alcohol. Another, is a SNP in a nicotine metabolizing enzyme gene, which is found more frequently in non-smokers than in smokers. Some mutations can work both ways, and I've mentioned this in earlier lectures. The family can offer protection from drug use. Strong bonds between parents and children are protective. Discipline and enforcement of limits by parents. Parental involvement in children's lives. Overall parental monitoring and positive rewarding fun together are all considered protective. Additional protective factors include self-control, academic competence, exercise, the presence of anti-drug information and education in schools, strong neighborhood attachments and involvements, and the opportunity for wholesome rewards. I mentioned active compensation for risk factors. In general, if someone has risk factors such as addiction in the family or mental illness, then they must work to reverse or to compensate for them1. It's good to know where you stand with regard to risk factors. Do not ignore them. It's important to stay healthy and deal with health problems in non-problematic ways. Don't self-medicate with drugs. And work with a physician concerning your health problems. It's best to stay away from drugs, from people who use drugs, and from places where drugs are used. Invest in goals that provide healthy rewards. Consider protective and risk factors together. Neither are fully determining, except perhaps for not taking drugs at all. These factors contribute to a tendency to take or not take drugs. All protective or risk factors are not equal. For example, if drugs were not available, then there would be no abuse or addiction. Assessment of these factors, sometimes with a professional, can be very helpful in choosing behaviors and activities. For some, avoiding one single experience with drugs, can prevent a lifetime of misery.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/BQthi/personality-judgment-risk-factors","Personality & Judgment Risk Factors","This lecture, will focus on two additional vulnerability factors, personality traits, and judgment. Personality traits can be thought of as habitual patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion. And some traits occur more frequently in drug abusers. The traits often associated with drug use include, risk taking, sensation seeking, and impulsive behavior. For example, sky diving may suggest to us, a risk-taking and sensation-seeking behavior. Or gambling, which to us suggests, risk-taking and impulsive behavior. While the personality traits of risk-taking, sensation seeking, and impulsive behavior, are associated with drug use, they in and of themselves, are not bad. Many of us have traits that could get us into trouble with drugs and other addictions, but these traits can also be beneficial, fun, exciting, and may, we may not want to give them up completely. So, the rule is, chose your specific risks and sensations well. Don't put yourself at risk for drugs. Now we move on to the second topic, which is judgement. Judgment is the way we infuse values into our decisions. Good judgment, and dealing with risk factors and drugs is obviously important. But, many drugs directly affect judgement. For example, marijuana is se, is sedating, and impairs cognitive function. Hallucinogens distort reality. Therefore, maintaining good judgement, is a special challenge for drug users. [SOUND] A part of the brain, that is critical for judgement and self regulation, is the Prefrontal Cortex. It's responsible for self-control, and anticipates negative consequences, so that we can make good judgments. This region of the brain, restrains impulses and actions, with bad outcomes. Drugs have been shown to alter functioning of the prefrontal cortex. Chronic drugs, can affect overall judgment, by altering the brain. The image shows a loss of activity in the front part of the brain, in a drug user. There's additional evidence, that chronic drug use can alter the prefrontal cortex. In alcoholics, the volume of the prefrontal cortex is significantly reduced, and is comparable to that of schizophrenics. Schizophrenics are serious, chronic, mentally ill patients. This reduction in the prefrontal cortex, is likely to be associated with a loss of emotional regulation. A loss or degradation of judgement, and a loss of inhibitions. Drug induced impairment of judgement, is a risk for a serious downward spiral, in drug taking. It goes something like this, taking drugs is bad judgement, drugs impair judgement. Impaired judgment leads to more drug taking. More drugs lead to more impairment, et cetera, et cetera. It's interesting that many addicts are convinced that they can stop drug use, only to find, that many of them can't. Drug induced brain changes can be very powerful, as we've discussed, and treatment is needed. Overconfidence is a very dangerous part of being an addict. You can see that the actions of drugs are complex, and in many ways, they impair the functioning of the brain. So that addiction can't, occurs, and is maintained.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/KBMlm/environmental-risk-factors","Environmental Risk Factors","Environmental risk factors are important, and can interact with personal ones to increase the overall risk for drug use. Some environmental risk factors are; stress in a variety of forms, sometimes in societal status, availability of drugs, which is a very important risk factor, peer pressure to take drugs, and even advertising for legal drugs. Here's an interesting experiment with monkeys, relating social status with vulnerability and drug use. Consider monkeys in two situations. One situation is when they live alone, and another is when the same animals are put together in groups of four. When they live together in a group, they establish hierarchies. One monkey becomes dominant, and the others in the group are subordinate. Dominant monkeys, for example, are groomed more often by others, are more aggressive, and are submitted to more often by the others. In this experiment, two very interesting measurements are made in these animals. One is determining their levels of D2 receptors by PET scanning. Because, these receptors are associated with the vulnerability to take drugs, which is something you already know. Another measurement is drug self-administration. Because, this will actually show how much drugs these animals will take. The results are fascinating. After living together for some months, the animals that emerged as dominant had increases in their D2 receptor levels by 20 to 25%, compared to when they were living alone. However, the other animals, the subordinates, didn't have any significant changes in D2 receptor levels. So, the transition to being a dominant animal actually increased the levels of D2 receptors in the brain. Because of the inverse relationship between D2 levels and drug taking vulnerability, this suggests that the dominant animals have less vulnerability to drug use. Drug self-administration experiments did show that the dominant animals, the ones with the higher D2 levels, took less cocaine than the subordinate animals. Overall, this interesting experiment implies that social situations can, in part lower, or perhaps, higher degrees of vulnerability. It also implies that your social situation can change your vulnerability. What is it about being dominant, that reduces vulnerability? Is it a reduction in stress? Or, is it something about the ability to be dominant? These are fascinating questions, that remain to be answered. Are there lessons in this work for humans? While applying animal studies to human behavior must be done with caution, there are some interesting questions to think about. Can the social environment that you are in influence drug taking? What social factors influence it? Is it stressful to be at the bottom of a hierarchy? Is it stressful to be the boss? Does our attitude about our social position affect stress levels? Is it social enrichment that's the key? Or do all of these have an influence? The questions and issues raised by animal models and experiments can be profound. Here you see two different environments. Which would you prefer to be in? The environment shown on the left, or the environment shown on the right? Remember to look at the review questions at the end of this lecture.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/BBpAd/the-interaction-of-vulnerabilities-risk-factors","The Interaction of Vulnerabilities & Risk Factors","In this video, I will discuss several topics including stress, growth and development, adolescence, and vulnerability. I will also show how these different kinds of vulnerabilities and risk factors, can interact with one another. First, let's define stress. Stress is a set of reactions, to an event, that upsets an ideal physiologic equilibrium in your body, or, you can simply say that stress is the overall response of the body, to a demand, placed on it. There are consequences of stress, as you know. There is an elevation of stress-related chemicals and hormones, such as cortisol. There is a change in nervous, endocrine and immune systems. Long-lasting stress, can have wide range of effects in the body, by offering immune responses, and development. And provoking anxiety, depression, drug use, and others. Handling stress in a non-destructive way, is an important life skill, that everybody must learn. Stress promotes continuing drug use, and relapsed drug use. The brain stress system, is one of those effected by drugs. In animal studies, for example, stress increases opiate drug self administration. Increases the reward value of drugs, and provokes relapse to drug taking and drug seeking. As I just mentioned, finding healthy ways to handle stress, is very important, not only for avoiding drugs, but also for ending drug use, and preventing relapse. Now let's look at children and adolescents. It's critical to emphasize, that children and adolescents are more vulnerable, to drug use. This vulnerability can have an impact, even in later life, many years later, when the children and adolescents become adults. This graph shows that the younger you are when you use drugs for the first time, the greater your risk for addiction, at anytime in your life. On the x-axis, or the horizontal axis, you can see the Age at First Drug use. On the vertical axis, or the y-axis, you can see the prevalence of lifelong drug dependence. If your first drug use occurs at around the age of 20, you have a prevalence measure of somewhere between ten and 15 units. But, if your first drug use was at age 13, you have twice the predicted prevalence of drug use. So exposure to drugs at a younger age increases your risk, to use drugs throughout your life. The data in this image shows that adolescent rats, seek more reward, than adult rats. The data indicate that the intake of sweetened condensed milk, which rats find very desirable, is much greater in puberty, than in adulthood. These data likely reflect tendencies in humans as well. Adolescence is a time of great vulnerability. [SOUND] Consider this interesting experiment, which involves the separation of rat mothers from their pups, for a temporary period, immediately after their birth. Rat mothers typically leave the nest to forage for food for relatively short times. But an extended absence from the nest can be stressful, to the pups and mothers. So in this experiment. Some litters were raised with a 15 minute separation, of mothers from pups, once a day, after birth for two weeks only. Other litters were raised with a 180 minute separation. The 180 minutes separation is stressful. There are no other differences between the groups in these experiments. After the two weeks, of once daily separation, all of the litters are raised in exactly the same way. It's only during the first two weeks of life, that there's a difference. But when the pups are adults. Months later in life, they are allowed to self administer cocaine or alcohol, and both groups are compared. The data show that the adults who were separated from moms, for 180 minutes while they were pups, have a greater preference for alcohol. The results are the same for cocaine. We conclude that early in life stresses, can affect behavior and vulnerability, into adulthood. This is a striking result, temporary separation of newborns from moms, once a day for just two weeks, changes the animals forever. As adults, months after the treatment, their drug intake, has changed. This is true for both cocaine, which is a stimulant, and alcohol, which is a depressant. Otherwise, the groups look the same. They have the same body, weight and appearance. Again, early development is a time of considerable vulnerability. Early in the course, we mentioned that we must be cautious when applying results of animal studies to humans. So care must be taken when we think about this result, and its applicability to humans. But actually, there is some data saying that early life stress affects drug taking in humans, when they're adults. Please examine the readings for this week. [SOUND] Let me summarize. If exposed to drugs while young, humans are more likely to take drugs as adults. Young animals seem more sensitive to, and more interested in rewards, as was shown, shown, with the sweetened condensed milk. Finally, periods of stress early in life, increase vulnerability, even as adults. An important conclusion, is that the youth must be a very important target for prevention efforts. Prevention means that you don't let them even get started with drugs. This can prevent or reduce life long problems.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/9v5Cz/self-medication-co-morbidity","Self-Medication & Co-Morbidity","Having discussed some genetic and physiologic factors, I will now address the interconnected ideas of self-medication and co-morbidity. Self-medication, by definition, is the use of drugs by an addict to lessen the discomfort of an existing problem other than the addiction problem. Everyday problems that can coexist with using drugs are, for example, stress, grief and loss, crises of some kind, violence, or trauma, or pain. We know that sometimes these can be very difficult to deal with, and we might not be surprised if someone tried to escape by using drugs. Because of mutations in polymorphisms, we are all genetically different, except for identical twins. Some of us are shorter, or taller than others, some men get bald, while others don't. It's interesting that it's been suggested, that some of us may be deficient in reward mechanisms in our brain. Such a deficiency in reward, if it exists, could spur us to seek more intense rewards to feel normal. And, this could be a factor in someone using drugs, and perhaps in becoming an addict. It's be shown that addicts frequently have additional coexisting problems that seem to predispose them to addiction, or at least excessive drug use. For example, someone with high anxiety, may consume alcohol to calm himself, or herself. The following diagnoses have been associated with drug use, attention disorders, aggressive behaviors, conduct disorders, mood disorders and anxiety disorders. They are referred to as co-morbid disorders. Co-moribidity implies that two or more disorders or problems, exist in the same person, often at the same time, or maybe also one after the other. Co-morbidity also suggests that the disorders can interact, and make all of them worse. Let's look at some data from the International Consortium in Psychiatric Epidemiology. 35% of a group of drug users met the criteria for mood disorder, 45% for anxiety disorder, and 50% for conduct, or personality disorder. There's more data. In another study, the occurrence of various disorders in drug users, over a lifetime, was examined. 29.9% of drug users, at one time or another, were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Almost 41% with a mood disorder, over 33% with a depression, and almost 11% with a social phobia. Some of these disorders can be very problematic, and it wouldn't be surprising if some people tried to self-medicate with a legal or illegal drug. So, what does this mean? Well, co-morbidity has important implications. Sometimes, the causes or factors that contribute to continued drug use are not simply, dependence or addiction. There are other problems. For some addicts to stop using drugs, the coexisting disorders need to be treated, as well. Treatment programs are impacted, and know about this. So co-morbidity is obviously important.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/5T9sF/risk-factors","Risk Factors","In the last lecture, I showed you a list of some of the biological, physiological, and developmental risk factors that have been discovered. Today, we're going to look at genetic predisposition in greater detail. It's clear that genetics do contribute to the risk for drug addiction. Stated simply, this means that if your parents or other family members have abused or, or are abusing drugs then the chances, or the risk that you will also abuse drugs increases. The best data for this comes from, what we call, cross adoption studies. Sons of alcoholics adopted at birth to nonalcoholic families have a four fold greater probability of becoming alcoholic than their stepbrothers. Conversely, sons of nonalcoholic parents adopted and raised by alcoholic families, did not tend to become alcoholics even when their step brothers did. These studies and a large number of many other studies like them indicate that genes are involved in becoming a drug addict. But, it's also been shown that genes do not totally determine your drug related life. They can influence drug taking, but they do not, by themselves, fully determine it. You can not get away with saying, that I take drugs simply because my parents do or did. Let's continue to talk about genetics. We've talked about the fact that genes are found in DNA. Which is found in the chromosomes. A mutation is a change in the DNA sequence. It could be a change in a single nucleotide, a duplication of a sequence, and insertion of a sequence, a deple, a deletion of a sequence or a copy or repair error. Mutations can have an effect on function. This isn't surprising because a mutation in a gene, is likely going to effect the protein made from it. There can be a loss of function, which means that the gene product has no or a lesser function as a result of the mutation. There can be a gain of function where the new product has an improved function. The mutation can also result in a dominant negative which means that the gene product antagonizes the original gene and its product. A lethal mutation leads to the death of the individual and a back mutation is a mutation that results in the original gene. A harmful mutation decreases the health performance of the individual. A bene, a beneficial mutation does the opposite. A neutral mutation has no effect. And the effect of a mutation might be mixed, in that it could be beneficial in some way and perhaps harmful in another way. We will be using the word polymorphism. This refers to the simultaneous existence in a population of different mutations. In other words, your genes may not be the exact same as mine even though we function about the same. These mutations occurred in our ancestors, and are passed down. SNPs or Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms are used in studies of heritability. An example of a SNP is shown in the image. Some of us might carry the GC version of the gene, while others of us might carry, carry the AT version of the gene. Obviously, the SNPs we are considering are not lethal because those, having them would die. But SNPs can affect the function of the protein because they can affect the make up and structure of the protein. One of the versions of the protein might be found more often in addicts for example. In that case, one could say that it might partly cause the addiction. It would at least be associated with addiction. A SNP in the mu opiate receptor protein is found more frequently in a group of heroin addicts. A SNP occurring in a dopamine receptor is more frequent in alcoholics. It's not yet clear how much the different SNPs influence addiction or why they should. This is a current area of research. Also we know that an association does not prove that it's a cause. Nevertheless, associations of SNPs with addiction have been very useful in exploring the molecular basis of the disorder. Let's consider the genetics of nicotine receptors and there role in smoking. In week three, I mentioned that nicotine receptors were composed of subunits, each made by different genes. And I mentioned that nicotine receptors are actually receptors for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This image from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, shows bundles of five subunits in a circle. Where there is an open core, which represents a channel for ions.This bundling is just a rough schematic of the receptor. Note that there are different kinds of subunits. One has Alpha 1 and Beta 2, another is Alpha 7 and so forth. Each of these multiple subunits are produced by different genes. It's been shown that the occurrence of a certain SNP in the Alpha 5 subunit is associated with pleasure from a first cigarette and with increased risk of dependence among early smokers. So here's a link between the composition of the receptor for nicotine and the likelihood that someone will become a smoker. It isn't clear yet, how the occurrence of these subunits and SNPs create the vulnerability. But it's a compelling topic for future research. When researchers figure out why, then maybe we can counteract the effect somehow. No single mutation or polymorphism causes addiction. Some studies indicate that dozens of genes are involved in addiction. It's been suggested that many genes have to interact with the environment to produce addiction. Addiction is not like Cystic Fibrosis, where a single gene causes the disease. This is good in the sense that without simple genetic determinism. Our behaviors, environment, and medications can be altered or used somehow to reduce our vulnerability to use drugs. Finally, it's important to mention that while certain genes or polymorphisms can confer a vulnerability, they can also be protective. They can reduce the likelihood that you will use drugs. For example, a mutation in an enzyme that metabolizes alcohol causes an illness in those drinking alcohol and the mutation reduces drinking. It's found in Asian populations. Another example, a SNP in a gene that metabolizes nicotine is more frequent among nonsmokers. So mutations can be both bad and good in terms of associating with drug use or nondrug use. In summary, this has been a very brief and partial view of a very large field of study, showing that some genes and polymorphisms are involved with and associated with drug addiction. 40 to 60% of the variance in the inheritability of alcoholism can be traced to genetics. It's not 100%. No single gene causes drug addiction. Presumably, many genes, plus the environment and perhaps personal factors somehow produce the addict. The involvement of many genes, environment, and perhaps personal factors in producing drug abuse is, in a sense, a good thing. It means that there are at least some variables that we are in control of. We can fight against addiction. Personal responsibility for our behavior is still a big factor in preventing and dealing with drug use.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/1MJeU/will-i-become-an-addict","Will I Become an Addict?","This program is brought to you by Emory University. >> Today, we begin the very important topic of vulnerability. And this lecture will include an overview of things we'll discuss in more detail in later lectures. Vulnerability addresses the question of, will I become an addict, or will you become an addict? Let's revisit this image from week one. the image shows the same person before and after becoming involved with methamphetamine. Becoming involved with drugs, as you know, is a very serious and often deadly proposition. If it can be prevented, it must be. Thus, the study of vulnerability is very important. If we compare large groups of drug users with large groups of non-users, we see differences. The differences associated with taking drugs are called risk factors or vulnerability factors. These are the factors that appear to make you vulnerable to drug use. We don't have a complete understanding of vulnerability. We can't write an equation for and, and precisely determine if you will or will not become an addict. Vulnerability and risk are tendencies and nothing more. Fortunately, there are also protective factors, that we can uncover by, comparing drug users with non-users. Now why do we care? Why do we want to identify risk factors and what makes people vulnerable? Well the obvious answer is that we want to protect ourselves and each other. If individuals are at risk, they can assess if they need to be proactive and self protective. We can warn and help friends who are in danger. And we can also try and compensate for risk factors. In addition, prevention resources can be directed at the most vulnerable populations to be most effective. So there are many reasons to identify the risk factors that we face. What are these vulnerability or risk factors? An important one is our biology. Do members of a family take drugs? Are there inherited factors? We will discuss heritability, but let me say in advance that inherited risk is not fully determining. If your parents were drug addicts, it does not mean for certain that you will become and addict. It seems that genetics have about a 50% influence on the process of addiction. This knowledge comes from detailed studies of genetics and drug abuse. The personality and overall health of the person can contribute to vulnerability. It's known that, co-morbid or coexisting health problem often occur at the same time as drug addiction and they likely influence drug taking. Risk taking and impulsive behavior are personality traits that are also risk factors. Finally, the environment plays a very major role. Are drugs available? Is there peer pressure or stress? And all of these can be somewhat interrelated. Let's consider some important and well appreciated risk factors. There's genetic predisposition. Personality traits and temperament. The age at first exposure to drugs. Co-existing health problems. Attempts at self-medication. And impaired judgment, which can be caused by the drugs themselves. All of these will be discussed. What about environmental risk factors? Well, the availability of drugs is a big one. If drugs weren't available there wouldn't be any drug addiction. And let's not forget stress, stress is an extremely important risk factor. Social status can affect drug taking, particularly when it involves stress. Peer pressure in an adolescent population can be a very big, strong risk factor. And drug awareness, even advertising for legal drugs can be a risk factor. What about the other side of the coin? What about protective factors? All of the following seemed to be involved with lower drug use. These are self control. Academic competence. Antidrug information in school. Strong neighborhood attachments. Actively compensating for risk factorssome genetics can be protective. Parents' attitudes and the kind of home they provide can be protective. And animal studies have shown us that enriched environments can be protective as well. In the home, enforcement of limits and discipline, forming strong bonds with children, and monitoring children seem to help. It's comforting to know that we can take active steps to reduce risk. Overall, all of these factors will say a lot about who can potentially become an addict.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/PKmTS/course-summary-part-2","Course Summary, Part 2","In the previous lecture, I reviewed 16 of the 30 or so key issues covered in this course. In this video, I will continue with the remaining ones. We'll begin our review with vulnerability. Vulnerability address the question of will I become an addict or will you become an addict. Vulnerability factors are factors that increase your chances of becoming an addict. There are biological ones. For example, inherited genes. If your siblings or parents use drugs, then you are more likely to use them as well. However, genes are not fully determining. They influence the use of drugs to about 50%. Other factors account for the remaining 50%. No single gene causes drug addiction. You can't blame your parents exclusively. Many genes plus the environment and plus personal factors somehow in a complex way interact to produce drug addiction. Aside from the biological factors, what are other kinds of vulnerability factors? Well, there are personal ones, and these include co-morbid problems and the traits of being a risk taker, or impulsive, and others. There are environmental factors that include stressful situations, the availability of drugs, peer pressure and peer behavior. And again, these can be interrelated. We can't forget that there are also protective factors. These are factors that protect against drug use or at least are found less frequently in drug-abusing subjects. Protective factors include self-control, academic competence, information in schools, strong positive neighborhood attachments, actively compensating for risk factors, some genetics, and our parents. Monitoring children, forming strong bonds with children, enforcement of limits and providing discipline are protective factors in the family. Animal factors have shown us that animals that are in, in enriched environments are protected from taking drugs. This suggests that we need to provide other interesting and positive rewards in our lives to help us avoid drugs. Co-morbidity. This is also important. It means that two or more disorders or problems exist in the same person often at the same time, but maybe also one after the other. Co-morbidity also suggests that the disorders can interact and worsen each other. There are some implications of co-morbidity. Sometimes, the cause of continued of drug use is not only craving and being the state of, in, in the state of addiction. Drugs may be taken for other reasons such as dealing with co-existing health problems. For some addicts to stop using drugs, these co-existing disorders and problems need to be treated as well. Treatment programs do consider this. Adolescence is a time of great vulnerability. In fact, human studies show that using drugs in adolescence increases the risk of addiction in adulthood many years later. For example, if you start using drugs at age 13, your risk of becoming dependent at some point in your life can be more than two times greater. Another interesting issue is how early life stresses around birth affects drug-taking all the way into adulthood. The image shows that rat pups separated from their moms temporarily for a 180 minutes, which is a stressful long period for pups and moms, influences drug-taking when the pups grow up. These perinatal stresses influence your drug-taking for the rest of your life. What about social status? We talked about a study of dominant monkeys and subordinate monkeys after forming groups. The monkeys that became dominant developed higher D2 receptor levels and took less cocaine than the subordinates. This implies that social situations can impart a higher or lower vulnerability and can even change the vulnerability. What's the lesson in this for humans? We discussed the issue of judgment and the role of the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for self-control and good judgement. The prefrontal cortex anticipates negative consequences in our actions. It restrains impulses and actions with bad outcomes. There's abundant data showing that drugs alter the prefrontal cortex. Therefore, drugs can affect our judgement. The image shows a brain metabolism study where there's a reduction in brain metabolism or activity in several brain regions and the prefrontal cortex is on of those regions affected. Another critical aspect to review is the downward spiral of drug use. Taking drugs is bad judgement and taking drugs impairs judgement. Impaired judgement leads to more drug-taking and more drug-taking leads to more impairment, etc. This downward spiral is very difficult to recognize and often not acknowledged by the drug user. Many drug users are convinced that they can stop at any time, only to find that they have spiraled to the point where many of them cannot stop. Risk factors. Risk factors increase our chances of using drugs. We need to know what our risk factors are. This can be helpful because knowing our risk factors can help us choose behaviors, associations and places that minimize our risk for taking drugs. Sometimes, getting the help of a professional can help you identify risk factors. The professionals know more and can effectively guide you to compensate for your risks. Treatment is effective. It can cut drug use in half. It can reduce criminality up to 80%. It can reduce arrests up to 64%, and it can reduce the costs of drug-related crime. Given that treatment costs money, it's important to realize that treatment does not really cost us. Rather, overall, it saves money. How is treatment done? If we go into treatment, what can we expect? Fortunately, there's a large repertoire of treatment tools and approaches. Counseling and behavioral modifications can help us avoid drugs and identify and resolve issues underlying drug use. Treatment might include the use of medications to reduce craving, to block getting high, or to treat co-morbid problems. Treatment should include medical care, depending on your health, to get the patient in the healthiest and strongest possible state so they can deal with abstinence and the struggle to stop using drugs. Sometimes treatment can be very practical and even include job training. Now we come to harm reduction. Harm reduction can be described as a set of strategies that reduce the negative consequences of drug use. It's a policy that builds on a respect for people who get in trouble with drugs. It accepts drug use as a complex disorder and provides non-coercive and non-judgmental help. It doesn't stigmatize people as addicts, losers, diseased or alcoholic. It helps them to get better and to reduce the problems that they create around themselves. It's worth remembering that addiction is a brain disorder or disease like many other diseases associated with other organs. It compares to many ways to atherosclerosis or asthma, for example. There's no inherent reason to have any stigma. Stigma itself is a problem that must be overcome. Because the use of drugs can be disruptive, their availability is often against the law or at least restricted. This brings us to drug courts. If a drug user commits a crime, he or she can be sent to a drug court, which appreciates the disease aspect of drug use and the value of treatment just as much as it does crime, punishment and incarceration. People are held accountable for treatment and other obligations. For example, obligations to the family are enforced by the drug court judge. It's also worth noting that court-mandated treatment works. You don't have to want treatment for it to work. There are different kinds of drug courts to meet different needs. There are adult criminal drug courts and drug courts that deal with family issues. In any case, drug courts have an excellent record and are successful. They should not be feared. Rather, they should be embraced as an enlightened and effective approach to dealing with drug users. Finally, our attitudes matter. How should we think about drug abuse? We need to treat drug abuse as a public health problem, but crime that occurs must also be addressed. We should support treatment and prevention to reduce drug use. Prevention of drug use in children is especially important in our society. We should support funding for research into the process of addiction treatment, prevention, and drug policies. We should help fight against the stigma of drug use, and other, and other diseases so that drug users will more readily come forward for treatment, which in turn will reduce negative consequences for all. This ends our course on the addicted brain. I hope you will use this information to improve all of our lives. I enjoyed working with you, and good luck.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/5Jiy9/course-summary-part-1","Course Summary, Part 1","Hello, and congratulations. We've covered a great deal of material in these seven weeks, and these final two lectures will summarize about 30 key points that we've covered in the course. Of course, the number 30 is somewhat arbitrary, but our review will reflect the objectives of the course. We started out with the definition of drug abuse and addiction. It's the seeking and taking of substances such that there are negative consequences in your life. The negative consequences can vary from the loss of a job to great personal distress, to acquiring a police record, and others. In addition, some control over behavior is lost in the process. Other experiences may be that someone has tried to stop, but failed. They may have developed tolerance and they may have experienced withdrawal. Also, there's a distinction between addiction and dependence. Dependence implies that if one stops taking the drug abruptly, it will result in the experience of withdrawal symptoms. This is true for many drugs and medications, including taking opiate drugs for pain. Addiction is something more than dependence. Addiction is, as said many times, the compulsive behavior and, of seeking and taking drugs in spite of negative consequences. We can think of drug abuse in many ways. This is helpful when we're trying to understand the disorder. Besides being a destructive behavior, drug abuse is also a brain disorder, chronic and relapsing, powerful, but treatable and beatable. While addiction is the main topic of this course, it's obvious that the different addicting drugs have additional toxicities. These different toxicities make some drugs more dangerous than others. The image shows a person before and after taking methamphetamine for a long period of time. Obviously, the chronic use of methamphetamine has changed the person quite a bit by producing a variety of health toxicities. Drug use and abuse is a serious problem. It's a greater problem than most people realize. There are legal drugs which are more available because they're legal. These include alcohol and nicotine. Illegal drugs have a lesser use, but the use is still substantial. The documented cost of drug use is probably greater than 500 billion and that doesn't include personal misery that drug use brings. We pointed out that when someone takes a drug either orally or intravenously, the drug has to get to the brain to work. But there are various processes in the body that influence how much of the drug will get to the brain and for how long it will be found there. These processes are absorption, metabolism and elimination, which involve a variety of organs in the body. When talking about addicting drugs or medications that affect the brain, we have to talk about the process of synaptic transmission. Synaptic transmission is the basis for how the brain operates and understanding it is key for knowing how drugs work. So synaptic transmission must be something you understand. Sometimes you use the word neurotransmission, which is the same. We've talked a good deal about neurotransmitters. Dopamine is one of them. Neurotransmitters are made, stored in vesicles, released by electrical impulses, interact with receptors and are removed from the receptors. There are different kinds of neurotransmitter receptors. Two that we've discussed include ion channel receptors and g protein-coupled receptors. Nicotine, for example, works at ion channel receptors for acetylcholine. And several other drugs and the neurotransmitter dopamine act at g protein-coupled receptors. It's important to be familiar with receptors. Neurotransmitter receptors are proteins which are the molecular sites that a neurotransmitter has to interact with to produce an effect. But a drug receptor can be anything, such as a transporter or also a neurotransmitter receptor. It's the molecular site that the drug binds with to initiate its action. For example, the cocaine receptor is the dopamine transporter and the nicotine receptor is the acetylcholine receptor. Neurotransmitters are very powerful substances in the brain because of their ability to act as messengers and to activate various receptors. Drugs, also by acting through the synapse in various ways, are somewhat like neurotransmitters in that they can alter synaptic transmission and chemical signalling. But neurotransmitters in drugs differ in very important ways. The duration of action of a neurotransmitter in the synapses is very short, often fractions of a second. On the other hand, the action of a drug on transmission at the synapse is much longer, from minutes to hours. The presence and action of neurotransmitters at synapses is well controlled by the brain by controlling release and removal. On the other hand, the presence and distribution of drugs are determined by the drug user and how often and how much they take. Also, the processes of absorption, metabolism and elimination are not controlled by the brain. The brain doesn't have the mechanisms for control. The brain has co-evolved with neurotransmitters and signaling molecules, and it controls them very well. However, the brain has not co-evolved with drugs and has no way of controlling their effects at the synapse. Neurotransmitters and neurotransmission are normal and life-sustaining. On the other hand, drugs majorly distort neurotransmission. Another important topic is that drugs are multifunctional. A single drug can do many things. One, it's because a single drug can produce a variety of physiological effects at a single receptor. Two, it's because a single drug can act at many different receptors. This is a very important feature about both addicting drugs and medications. For example, cocaine can be both a local anesthetic, a stimulant and addicting at the same time. Addicting drugs can be amazingly different in various ways, but they're all the same in that they change the brain and behavior. The discovery that animals will self administer drugs has had many implications. It says that the mechanisms that regulate substance intake is shared among animals and humans. Further, almost all of the drugs that humans abuse are self-administered by animals. This emphasizes that humans and animals share the related brain mechanism. Because of these findings, drug self-administration in animals is used as a way to test if various substances are possibly addicting in humans. Also, the drug self-administration paradigm is used to identify and test possible treatment medications. The paradigm of drug self-administration can be broken down into several parts. These include acquisition of the drug habit, maintenance of drug taking, abstinence and relapse. This is important because each of these separate processes may use different brain mechanisms and being able to study each individually is an advantage when searching for treatments. We have talked about the brain as a survival organ. In that sense, the brain has many circuits and functions devoted to ensuring our survival. These include making us feel good after we have carried out various processes that help us survive. These are, for example, eating when hungry, drinking when thirsty, and mating. These are the same circuits in the brain that mediate drug abuse and addiction. While we don't know all of these circuits and brain regions, we have a good idea about many of them and research teams are constantly searching to clarify this. A major goal is to understand all the brain circuits that contribute in any way to addiction. We know that one of these important circuits is the mesolimbic system, which contains dopamine. [BLANK_AUDIO] We can consider dopamine and its neuronal circuits as being associated with reward. Experiments have shown that dopamine is elevated in the brain by giving drugs such as cocaine. And it is elevated also by sexual activity. From the perspective of a dopamine receptor at the synapse, the receptor can't distinguish between sexual activity and an injection of cocaine. So dopamine is related to both drug reward and natural rewards. Because drugs manage to insert themselves into the reward systems, they become very powerful. We have discussed dopamine in a lot of detail and in a lot of circumstances. But we have also pointed out that dopamine is not the only important neurotransmitter in addiction. Dopamine does not simply equal, equal reward, but probably does something more complex. Nevertheless, dopamine is an important neurotransmitter in reward and has been studied in many ways in addiction. Each addicting drug or class of drugs usually interact with a specific neurotransmitter, and we've discuss each of this. Major technical events as in breakthroughs in neuroscience have provided very powerful tools for us to study addiction. One that we discussed in detail is PET scanning. PET scanning allows us to determine the levels of various proteins and also using a different arrangement, the metabolic rate of various brain regions. PET scanning studies of D2 dopamine receptors have made an important discovery. The discovery is that low levels of D2 receptors in the human brain are associated with greater vulnerability to addiction. The image shows dopamine receptor levels for subjects using cocaine, methamphetamine or alcohol. Note that there are fewer receptors in the drug users compared to the non-drug using subjects. The use of PET scanning in living human subjects has shown us in concrete molecular terms that recovery from drug use is slow. It can take months to years for the brain to heal and return to normal. The image shows that receptor levels are not yet back to normal after four months of abstinence. Because drugs change receptors, they will obviously change the function of various synapses and circuits. If we could prevent or reverse these changes, we might be able to prevent or reverse the process of addiction. Because of this, we're very interested in understanding how drugs change the brain. Brains are endowed with the property of neuronal plasticity. The brain, in response to various influences and stimuli, can change its structure, its chemical signalling, its gene expression and protein makeup, and in other ways. We looked at some of the mechanisms of neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is important. For example, learning and forgetting, or recovery from brain damage are common forms of neuroplasticity. And, of course, drugs promote neuro, neuroplasticity, resulting in changes in behavior. A fundamental expression of life in the brain and indeed in all cells is the translation of genetic information into proteins. We discussed how activation of receptors leads to signaling mechanisms that alter, for example, transcription factors that alter gene expression. We also discuss epigenetic mechanisms that include methylation of DNA or acetylation of the chromatin that alters access to an expression of genes. While we have far to go to cure addiction, we certainly have learned a lot.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/zRaWU/drugs-criminality","Drugs & Criminality","Because drug use can be destructive, not only to the person using the drugs but also to those around him or her, the availability and possession of drugs is often against the law, or restricted by the law, in some way. In this lecture, we're going to take a look at drugs and criminality. There are certain factors that suggest to many that we should review our policy on drugs and criminality. For example, in spite of a war on drugs, drug use has increased in the United States during the so-called war. Also, an astounding 3% of American adults are either in prison, on probation, or on parole. And drug policies have played some role in this. Should we reexamine this and try to find a way to reduce this harm to everyone? First, let's deal with the issue of freedom. Is drug use anybody's business? One might say that the government has no right to limit anyone's freedom to take drugs. But, no man is an island. The adverse consequences of drug use places a burden on everyone. For example, children of alcoholics can have fetal alcohol syndrome. Accidents that hurt many are caused by one person's intoxication. Infectious diseases are often spread, to a great degree, by drug users. Drug users are often dysfunctional parents and employees. The list could go on. We need to find the right balance. We need to find the best way to reduce harm with the least dig, degree of regulation and restriction. What about the control of drugs? Why do we do it, and how do we do it? Well certainly, drug use is affected by the availability of drugs. And the availability of drugs is affected by the legal status of these drugs. Possession of illegal drugs can be a crime, depending on the quantity and locale. Distributing these drugs can be a greater crime and carry greater penalties. Legal drugs, like tobacco and alcohol, are most available and not coincidentally the most used, but we try to impose age restrictions and taxes on these substances to reduce availability. Many would say we have a crisis and controversy on our hands. Should we legalize drugs or not? But, is that the right question? Is that the only choice? To decriminalize, and let me define that important word, is to reduce penalties in some cases, such as the possession of small quantities of drug. Decriminalization is not legalization. It's something more restrictive than legalization. Is the current policy for drugs producing more trouble and harm than the drugs themselves? After having strict policies against drugs for years, there are movements to decriminalize some drugs. For example, some states in the USA have legalized the recreational use and possession of small amounts of marijuana. Driving under the influence of the drug, and public consumption of marijuana, are not allowed. Portugal, for example, has introduced new laws and policies. When people are found guilty of possessing small amounts of drugs, they're sent to a panel that decides on treatment for those people. The idea is that punishment drives addicts underground, but why not give them the treatment they need? A survey claims that drug use among teens has dropped, and HIV infection rates have been reduced. There are other examples as well. These changes in laws and policies will provide data in the future, to further evaluate these actions and policies. Drug abuse, as we've said many times, is complicated and the effects and the out, outcomes of various treatments and policies may vary, depending on the group, society, or country being considered. We need to accept this complexity and search for effective solutions, which hopefully, will not be different in different situations. Let's talk about drug courts. If a drug user commits a crime, he or she can be sent to a drug court, which is a court that appreciates the value of treatment, as much as it does crime, punishment and incarceration. If people are assigned to treatment by the court, they're held accountable for completing the treatment. They may be held accountable for other obligations as well. For example, to their family. The drug court judge and the legal system enforce accountability. An important point here is that court-mandated treatment does work. You do not have to want, or actively decide to seek treatment for it to work. Also, there's different kinds of drug courts to meet different needs. For example, there are adult criminal drug courts that deal with adults charged with crimes, and there are family drug courts to help settle family problems. Drug courts have been shown to reduce crime nationwide. 75% of drug court graduates remain arrest free for at least two years after leaving the program. The most rigorous and scientific conservative studies have concluded that drug courts reduce crime as much as 45% more than other sentencing options, such as going to prison. Drug courts are effective justice interventions that save money. Nationwide, for every dollar invested in drug courts, taxpayers save more than $3 in avoided criminal justice costs alone. When considering and adding in other costs, such as savings from reduced victimization and health care services, studies show that benefits can range up to $27 for every dollar invested in drug courts. Drug courts produce cost savings ranging from 3,000 to $13,000 per client. These cost savings reflect reduced expenses in prison, revolving door arrests, trials, and reduced victimization. Part of the reason they work is that drug courts enforce compliance with their decisions. They provide more comprehensive and closer supervision than other community-based programs. Drug courts are six times more likely to keep offenders in treatment, long enough for them to get better. In family drug courts, family reunification rates are 50% higher than their other programs. It's clear that drug courts have been a success. A problem is that they are not as available as we need them to be, mainly because of lack of funds. So, considering all that has been said in these lectures, what should our attitudes be? Well, the following seems to be a reasonable approach. We should treat drug abuse as a public health problem. But if and when a crime occurs, it must be addressed as a crime. We should support treatment and prevention to reduce drug use. Prevention is the most inexpensive way to reduce the cost of drug use to society. We should prevent drug use especially in children, as drug use in childhood is a very strong risk factor for determining drug use in adulthood. We should not ignore collateral problems, such as spread of infectious diseases by drug users because of their impaired judgment. We also need to support funding for research into the processes of addiction, treatment, prevention and policy. We need to help fight against the stigma of drug use so that drug users will more readily come forward for treatment, which will reduce the negative consequences for all.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/z0rNf/government-drug-policy","Government Drug Policy","It's clear that our attitudes about drug users can vary. It's also clear that what we do with the drug user depends on a set of beliefs, on a policy, if you will. A physician's attitude about a drug user could be different from the attitude of a clergyman and could be different from the attitude of a policeman. But which policy is the best one, and what do we mean by best? Which policy is most correct or most defective in dealing with the problem? You can see that this is an issue with impact. Policy is a set of guidelines or perhaps attitudes about drug abuse and drug users that impacts public health, treatment, prevention, and the law. Policy reflects our vision of the present and future. For example, do we have an attitude of punishment, such that any illegal drug use is unacceptable and criminal? Some might believe this to be the most effective deterrent for drug users. Or do we believe in approaching drug use with the attitude of reducing as much harm to the user and society as we can? If we choose to punish drug users to the max to deter them from drug use or if we choose to try to reduce harm to everyone, there will be a different set of actions. For example, if we choose to emphasis punishment of drug users, we would create harsh laws and perhaps send them to prison. But if we wanted to reduce harm to everyone, we would want personal and public health issues to be addressed. We could take the righteous attitude that addicts have made their problem, so let them fix it. Or we might be more compassionate and say that some people can't walk away from drugs. Therefore, treatment can help and should benefit everyone, so let's treat them. So our policy can make a big difference in what we try to do and what is done and in the outcome. Harm reduction is something that must be seriously considered. It does not focus on how drug addiction is evil or wrong. It focuses on what we can do to reduce harm to everyone in the situation. It focuses more on prevention and treatment. Harm reduction is a philosophy that is getting more and more attention, at least as a partial solution to the drug problem. Let's consider it further. Harm reduction can be described as a set of strategies for reducing the negative consequences that come from drug use. It's focused on reducing harm to the users of drugs and to everyone affected by that. It includes a belief in and respect for people who get into trouble with drugs. It accepts drug use as a complex disorder and it supports providing non-coercive and non-judgmental help. What about harsh treatment? Well, harsh treatment of drug users in some situations might not necessarily be contradictory to harm reduction, but a policy of mandatory and universal harsh treatment would be. Many who believe in harm reduction wouldn't label people as addicts, losers, diseased or alcoholic. These are stigmatizing and provide no concrete help. Also, it makes it sound as if the drug user is powerless and is a certain kind of person forever. Perhaps we need to find a terminology and a mindset that focuses on the processes and actions of drug users, rather than labeling their character and destiny. If we wanted to practice harm reduction, what would be the practical targets of this idea? Well, we would want to prevent people from driving while intoxicated, which we do. We would want to prevent poor heath consequent to drug use. We would want to treat and reduce drug-induced toxicities and the spread of diseases and infections that are related to drug use. We would want to reduce violence, poor job performance, poor parenting, and so forth. Sometimes, the harm reduction policy can make recommendations and take steps that seem contradictory in that they seem to be promoting drug use. But they are, in fact, reducing harm or risk to everyone. Consider a program where addicts are given free, clean needles to inject drugs. We know that transmission of serious disease can, can occur by sharing or reusing needles for drugs. But if we provide clean needles, we can reduce the public health burden by not having to treat those serious life-threatening and chronic diseases. The image shows a needle kit given to addicts that helps for safe injections. If they have such a kit, they don't have to share or reuse needles. It includes needles, alcohol swabs and other things that facilitates safe injections. Does this practice facilitate and perpetrate addiction? While some might argue that it does, others would argue that it does not, but that is not the point we're making. The availability of these kits do not affect whether or not the drug users will continue to use drugs, but the availability of this quit, this kit, will reduce the public health burden not only of illnesses and infections, but also of crime, personal misery, and personal failure, and it works. Clean needle programs have a beneficial effect. Another aspect of harm reduction would be to screen addicts and drug users for disease. Providing free screening and treatment for things like AIDS can prevent the spread of such infections. Data in the table clearly show that infections are prevented when the presence of disease is identified and treated through these programs. Many people have thought about new policies and have examined the effects of various policies over the years. Some general policies favored by many are as follows. You will see that these clearly fall into the harm reduction theme. Consider drug abuse to be a public health problem and not fundamentally a criminal or moral problem. Reduce the demand for drugs by education and prevention and by making treatment available. Look to reduce and eradicate drug-related illnesses such as hepatitis and AIDS. Enact laws that support reduction in drug use. For example, no smoking in public places deals with the legal drug of nicotine. Crime, which can't be ignored, is a law enforcement problem. If an addict commits a crime, then law enforcement should deal with it. So a helpful policy would be to enforce the law, but avoid laws dealing harshly with possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use. We should support basic treatment and policy research. We don't know everything there is to know. Some day with research we may be able to more quickly and more effectively deal with compulsive drug use. Finally, each drug is different and each must have its own policies. For example, tobacco and alcohol are legal and more available than other drugs. Availability will impact public health to at least some degree. Keep availability under control and educate the public about the dangers of these drugs. Inhalants like glue and fuels are toxic, and often used by children. Target children with appropriate prevention efforts. Marijuana has toxicities and can be dangerous. For example, driving under the influence of the drug. Target these possibilities and prevent them. Some drugs, such as heroin and LSD, have no currently accepted medical uses. There's no reason why they should be available at all perhaps. Target the availability of these substances. Policy is important because it directs our thinking, our efforts and our resources. A policy that prevents most harm can be challenging to accept sometimes, but reducing harm is a concrete benefit to us all. Is punishment of those with a brain disorder more useful than reducing the harm of their illness? Definitely not. We are making good progress with harm reduction, but not everyone can easily accept all aspects of harm reduction. We'll have to see how this progresses.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/addiction-and-the-brain/lecture/lMYbY/treatment-part-2","Treatment, Part 2","Let's continue to talk about treatment. Treatment for drug abuse and addiction is critical and even if someone is convinced that he or she can walk away from drugs, it can't hurt to get some guidance from a professional. Because treatment is so essential, many people have done a lot of thinking about it. There are a number of principles that are related to effective treatment. Let's go over those in more detail. The first thing is to realize, is that professionals are available and facilities exist to help those who can't seem to get away from drugs by themselves. Individual vary in age, in severity of addiction, and in having coexisting problems. Treatment must be flexible enough to effectively deal with the various kinds of individuals. Drug abuse is complex. As I have said before, treatment must address this complexity. Treatment certainly should be available to those that need it, and making sure that enough money has been invested by society to make it available is of utmost importance. As treatment progresses, the needs of the patient may change. They may go from emergency and intensive care, to dealing with a sustained level of drug use. Or, once someone gets drug use under control, they may need job training or other kinds of activities to improve their lives. Thus, treatment may need to change and evolve as the process of recovery changes and evolves. Subjects need to remain in treatment for an adequate period of time. In general, treatment works and the chances that it will work with a specific person can depend on how much time is spent in treatment. Some studies suggest that perhaps more than three months in treatment is needed to get control of drug taking and to get the most out of treatment. Counseling can also help produce needed behavioral changes. The individual may have to eliminate something they're doing, such as hanging out with drug users. Or, they may have to add some things that they aren't doing, such as finding rewards and fun without bad consequences. Medications must be considered. It's clear that medications can help with the complexity of drug abuse. Medications can be especially useful in reducing craving. Coexisting, or what we refer to as comorbid problems, have to be addressed. Frequently, problems other than drug use exist, that enhance drug use. The coexistence of such a problem along with the drug problem, may make both problems worse. Sometimes people think that they only need to go through distressing withdrawal to stop the craving in the group of drugs. Going through withdrawal is referred to as detoxification. It's important to know that detox is a good starting treatment, but it's only a start. As you know, brain imaging has shown that the brain is changed for a long time and that the healing process is slow. To avoid relapse, treatment must be extended and included in li, in your life after detox. Some people say that you have to want to get off drugs to get off drugs. You need to want to get to clean for treatment to work. However, this seems to be an urban myth. Treatment does not to be voluntary to work. Court mandated treatment also works and this is important to realize. [BLANK_AUDIO] As someone progresses in treatment, his or her drug use must be monitored. This is the only way that we can concretely and objectively assess the patient's progress. Relapses are common but are not indicative of a total failure. Treatment can be resumed, and even though there may be relapses, they are, that is not a reason to give up hope. Drug users are sometimes unhealthy, make bad choices, and have poor judgment. Accordingly, drug users often are the carriers of some serious diseases, like AIDS, hepatitis or sexually transmitted diseases. Someone in treatment for drug abuse needs to made aware of this aspect of the problem. Treatment should assess and treat these problems as well, should the patient require it. I mentioned earlier that you have to remain in treatment for an adequate period of time, perhaps three months or more. This can translate into recovery requiring multiple episodes of treatment. People who do not give up and return to treatment when needed, sometimes again and again, do the best in recovering from drug use. And finally, it's all confidential. One doesn't have to worry that they're going to lose their job and be stigmatized forever because they're in treatment. Rather, the opposite is true. Unless they get a grip on their drug problem, they may have to deal with a prison record, failed relationships, and those won't be confidential. And they have the chance of stigmatizing and ruining a life. There are different kinds of professional helpers in the drug addiction area, with a broad range of training. Addiction psychiatrists are medical doctors and are capable of treating serious comorbid disorders. Family doctors and nurses can be involved in treatment and are often the first to realize that a patient needs treatment. Psychologists and social workers can be very effective counselors. Religious leaders in the community can also be very helpful. Drug court judges can be important because they are there to intervene at a potentially serious event in an addict's life. They have the authority to make sure individuals get the treatment they need, and treatment can be required if necessary. I'll discuss more about drug courts later. So, we've mentioned that there are many treatment principles that have been established, that there are different kinds of treatment professionals, and now we can look at the different approaches to treatment. As we've said before, drug use is complex and treatment has to address this complexity and may need to be complex. There needs to be many approaches. I mentioned detoxification, which is going through withdrawal. It gets drugs out of the body and allows one to begin to regain some stability in their life. Treatment can be inpatient where the patient enters the facility, or it can be outpatient where time is spent with a treatment professional, but then the patient leaves the facility. The seriousness or the severity of the addiction, coexisting or comor, comorbid problems, and other issues, will determine which is best. Long-term counseling and medications are a mainstay in treatment. The counseling can, can include several kinds of therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy. The medications can include medicines like methadone, which is used to reduce craving for opiates. There are 12-step programs that have good results for those who stick with these programs. And there are other approaches to treatment. I'm just providing some examples, so that you'll get an idea of what happens. And don't forget, prevention is the best treatment. Don't get started with drugs at all. Let's say a little bit more about medications. They can prevent relapse and reduce craving. There are medications for opiates, and these include methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone. Each of these drugs are slightly different and might be used for different types of patients. Medications for tobacco include the nicotine patch, spray, gum and lozenges. Nicotine replacement controls craving and the desire to smoke. Additional drugs to control smoking include bupropion and varenicline. To treat alcohol abuse, medications include naltrexone, which reduces the drive to take alcohol, and acamprosate and disulfiram. Because medications are so impactful, many researchers spend a great deal of time trying to find new medications and new strategies to develop medications. Let's talk about vaccines, vaccines for drugs of abuse. Vaccines against drugs have attracted a lot of attention. They are more or less a new approach to treat drug use, and there have been successes in both animal and human studies. But more development is needed. They're not yet ready for widespread use in the treatment of addiction. Vaccines have some interesting proble, properties that can make them advantageous over other existing medications. One, is that a treatment, which is an injection to produce antibodies would have long lasting effects. Months. Whereas a dose of a medication is likely to last only several hours. Medications have to get into the brain to have their medicating effect. Because they have to get into the brain, they can have side effects of their own. But antibodies from vaccinations do not have to enter the brain to work. They work in the blood, and therefore, antibodies do not have side effects like medications do. Let's go over how antibodies work. If you do not have antibodies in your blood and you take a drug, the drug will get into your blood and eventually get into the brain, where it's going to have its effect. But if you have been given a vaccine, which stimulates your immune system to create antibodies, the antibodies in your blood will bind the drugs in your blood and prevent them from getting to the brain. As I said, both human and animal studies indicate that vaccines and antibodies can reduce drug use and drug reward. But, better vaccines are needed to give more people benefit. This story's not over yet. Let's return to a more general discussion of treatment. What is successful treatment? Many professionals agree that success is defined as at least partly reducing the harm in your life by a reduction in drug use. Total abstinence of the drug is the best and ideal outcome. Relapse may occur, but that does not create a total failure. It merely indicates that treatment must be continued or perhaps adjusted somewhat. Reduction of harm, or some harm, is a success. No discussion about treatment would be complete without addressing the cost of treatment. As you can imagine, many studies have looked at the cost of treating drug addicts. According to several conservative estimates, every dollar invested in treatment yields a return of between 4 and $7, in reduced, drug related crime, criminal justice cost and theft. When savings to healthcare are included, the total savings due to treatment can exceed costs by a ratio of 12 to one. Major additional savings to the individual and to the society also stem from fewer interpersonal conflicts, greater workplace productivity, and fewer drug-related accidents, such as overdoses and deaths. Treatment does not cost us in the normal sense, it actually saves and reduces overall cost. Here is an exercise. Go to the Internet or some kind of directory that is available to you for your particular locale, and find treatment programs. Can you tell if they adhere to the treatment principles described in this lecture? You can learn about the availability of treatment in your area, and how you could be involved to improve it.",""

[BLANK_AUDIO] >> Now we come to one of the most important topics in drug abuse and addiction. That topic is treatment. Drug abuse can be very difficult to stop and relapsing is highly probable. Also, the disease itself impairs the ability to make judgements and reduces the ability to make free decisions. It affects the brain, so treatment is essential. Treatment is a lifeline to those who are experiencing the negative consequences of this disease and who are having difficulties stopping. It's been shown in many studies that treatment can cut drug use in half. It can reduce criminal behavior up to 80%. It can reduce arrests up to 64%. And it reduces the cost of drug-related crime. Treatment has proven to be effective and is not a waste of time. In fact, for a drug user, it can be the very best possible use of time. How do we define treatment? Treatment is a set of activities, such as taking medications or changing behaviors, with the goal or reducing or eliminating drug use. It can be as broad and as varied as the drug problem itself. Addiction is a very complex disorder and treatment must address these complexities. Treatment is not threatening. Those seeking treatment will not be put into jail. They will not be restrained and forced to undergo painful withdrawal. The individual and their wishes and goals are respected in treatment. A major concern about someone entering treatment has to do with confidentiality. They may have concerns like, who will know? I don't want be known as an addict. I'll lose my job. Treatment is confidential and what happens in treatment is private. Sometimes we encounter very surprising attitudes about addicts. Some people might say, why bother with treating them, they're only addicts? This attitude is without compassion, without the knowledge that addiction is a brain disorder or disease and without the realization that treatment exists and works. Also, those with this attitude lack an appreciation of the many benefits of treatment, such as savings in money and misery. Further, this attitude reflects the stigma of addiction. Addiction is not a moral failing, but one of many complex physiologic disorders that must be treated. Let's talk more about the stigma of drug addiction. Stigma is very important in this field. Stigma is an attitude of disgust associated with addiction, and it often turns out to be a cruel attitude. It's due mainly to a lack of information and rationality. Importantly, stigma prevents us from providing treatment because we want to avoid the problem and avoid the topic. Another important part of the problem of stigma is that it prevents an addict from coming forward to get treatment. They're afraid and in denial of their own problem. Therefore, overcoming and reducing the stigma around addiction is a major goal in public health. Some are very surprised that addiction can be compared to other chronic diseases that have little stigma. There include cardiovascular disease, asthma, diabetes and others. Let's compare addiction to one of the cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis. Both addiction and atherosclerosis are serious health problems. Both kinds of patients can be at least partly blamed for their own role in the disease, in their own decisions and actions. Both have a likely biologic or genetic vulnerability to the disease. Both diseases can be slowly progressing and are chronic. Relapses occur in both, and dealing with both can require a change in lifestyle. The table uses examples to compare the two diseases on the basis of medications, change behaviors and the development of new behaviors. The cardiovascular disease finds medications very useful to lower cholesterol, for example. In addiction, medications are helpful to reduce cravings, for example. In one, you have to change your behavior to avoid fatty foods and control your weight. In the other, you have to avoid drugs and drug users. New behaviors are needed. In one, you have to start exercising and dieting perhaps. In the other, you have to attend to coexisting health problems, and it's clear that treatment, while different, helps both diseases. So let me briefly summarize. Addiction is a brain disorder or disease like many other diseases associated with other organs. Addiction compares in many ways to atherosclerosis, for example, and other chronic relapsing diseases. There's no inherent reason for addiction to have any stigma. Stigma itself is a problem that needs to be overcome.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/aZZOz/data-analysis-part-i-what-is-a-good-study","Data Analysis, Part I: What is a Good Study?","[MUSIC] As we move to a future where we start to individualized therapy based on genetic testing, or other kinds of personalized treatments, we have to think about each time we implement one of those personalized treatments. What the statistical basis and what the evidence basis is, for treating one patient differently from all the rest. My intent here is not to review all of bio-statistics. But over this module and the next module I want to review some of the very basic principles that we use when we start to evaluate large data sets in the area of personalized medicine. The most important principle is garbage in, garbage out. And what I mean by that is that If we're going to act on data, we really have to be quite convinced that the data are high quality. If the data are garbage, then the conclusions have to be garbage. So one of the first and most important steps in the analysis of any data set is to ensure very, very high quality, whether that's a genetic test, or a biostatistical analysis, or defining a disease. All of those have to be done to the highest of quality standards, and it's a very important part of analysis of all genetic and other kind of large data sets. The standard way we have of evaluating a test is to look at its effects in a large population, and often in a large population of patients we have split up into two groups. Those groups can be split up by nature, so they could be patients who have a disease and patients who don't have a disease, patients who take a drug, patients who don't take a drug. Or sometimes we take a large population and we randomly assign them to get a drug or to not get a drug, that's a randomized clinical trial. That's the fundamental basis of deciding whether a test or a drug is actually going to be useful in long term treatment. So the idea is to compare the group on the right to the group on the left. Now as we do that, we have to make sure that the groups are chosen appropriately and comparable in other ways. So you have to make sure, for example, that the patients who take a drug are the same as the patients who don't take a drug with respect to how their disease was determined, when their disease was determined, how long they had the disease. Whether they're African American or European can make a huge difference. You don't want all women in one group and all men in another group. You don't want one group to have all the diabetics and one group not to have the diabetics. You don't want one group to take one treatment and another group to take another treatment. The time honored way of doing that, of assigning patients to one of two groups, is a randomized trial. Sometimes nature does the randomization for us, though. For example, if we're examining the effect of a genetic variant, we don't have control over that. So we compare patients with a genetic variants to patients without a genetic variant, and we try to ensure that all those other what we would call comorbidities, or cotherapies, are similar in the two groups of patients. So that's a very important concept in trial design and trial evaluation. So here we are with two groups that we're going to compare. Now pretend that one group, both groups have 50 patients in them. I've counted them and I made this slide. So one group has in the group on the left, 30 out of the 50 patients have a particular trait. And the group on the right, 15 have the particular trait. A common way of expressing the difference between those two groups is odds ratios or relative risks. So the odds ratio is the ratio of the odds in the two groups. The odds in one group is 1.5, so 30 out of 50 patients have the trait, 20 out of 50 don't, so 30 divided by 20 is 1.5. That's the odds in one group. The odds in the other group are 15 divided by 35, and that's 0.42. The ratio of those two is 3.57. So the odds ratio for that particular test, to distinguish between one group and another is 3.57. The relative risks are calculated in this same way. The risk in one group is 0.6. The risk in the other group is 0.3. And so the relative risk is 2.0. So odds, ratios, and relative risks are common ways of expressing the impact for example of a genetic variant on a trait in a population. And here are some examples for you to work on at home. Now one of the other questions we would ask ourselves if we had an example like this, suppose there are 20 patients with a trait out of 50 in one group and 15 patients with a trait In the other group. Or pretend that we were evaluating a drug, and 20 patients in one group had a beneficial response and 15 patients in the other group had a beneficial response. Are those two frequencies really different in a believable kind of way? And how about these two, here's an example where 49 out of 50 patients have a particular characteristic, a response to a drug or a genetic trait, and only 1 in 50 in the other group. It's pretty obvious that those two are different, but how do we express that and how do we quantify the differences? What kind of cutoffs do we use for evaluating those kinds of things? So the fundamental way of approaching that is the probability, or the P value. An easy way to think about P values is rolling the dice. So everybody's familiar with the idea that if you have dice that are not loaded dice, that are fair dice, and you roll them many, many, many times, the idea that we'll get A single, a one out of all of our rolls is one time in six. Or it might be 10 times in 60, or 100 times in 600, but one time in six, the number one will appear on the face of an unloaded dice. What about if we rolled two dice? Then the probability is one-sixth squared, and that turns out to be 0.0278. And if we roll the dice three times the probability that we get three ones, all together, is even smaller, it's 0.00462. That's about 4 times in 1000. So if we did the experiment 12 times, we'd get that the probability of rolling all 12 dice as ones at 4.6 x 10 to the -10. So that's a vanishingly small population. So if you took 12 dice and rolled them and got that result, [COUGH] you would say, gee whiz, maybe those dice are fixed. Or maybe that's a fluke, because boy, that is not likely to happen by chance. That's likely to happen only if there's something strange about the experiment. So let me go back to this, this is 1 in 36, 0.0278. Now, sometimes we ask, we might ask the question, what's the chances when we roll the dice that we're going to get a very high value or a very low value? So, what's the chances that we would get two ones or two sixes? The chances of that happening are shown on this slide, and it's around 0.05, 0.056. So it's around 1 time in 20, it's 1 time in 18. In conventional medical statistics, if we do an experiment over and over and over again, and we observe a p value of less than 0.05, we say that the chances are less than 1 in 20 that that's a fluke, that that could happen by chance. So if we see this result, we'd say boy, the dice must be loaded, or we think the dice might be loaded. So how about comparing this group of 20 people to this group of 15 people who might have a beneficial drug response or a particular genetic marker? And the fact is that the frequencies of those two can be compared using a statistic that will calculate the probability. The probability there is 0.29. So if we did an experiment [COUGH] where we took 100 people, randomly assigned 50 to treatment one and 50 to treatment two. We saw a beneficial response in 20 out of 50 in one group and a beneficial response in 15 out of 50 in the other group. We would say that the chances of that happening by chance is 0.29. And that's pretty much by chance. We wouldn't say that those are very different. On the other hand, if we did exactly the same experiment and saw a beneficial response in 3 out of 50 patients in one group and 15 out of 50 patients in the other group. Assuming those two groups are comparable in other ways. They're balanced with regard to ancestry, gender, age, comorbidities. The probability of seeing that difference by chance is less than 0.05, it's actually 0.0018, so we would say that that looks like that effect is real. And it's not just a chance distribution effect. So that's probability. Now one of the things that sometimes happens in experiments to look at the effect of drugs in a population or to look at the effect of a genetic marker on risk of a disease or an unusual response is that people look more than once. So I want to close this module with an example that highlights the risks of doing that. Here's the example that I gave you before. Beneficial response in 20 out of 50 in one group and 15 in out of 50 in the other group, a probability of 0.29. An investigator would look at that and say well, there is no difference in treatment outcomes between the two groups. Now the investigator might be very invested in this drug, he might say well, let me ask the question a little bit differently, and let me count outcomes in a little bit different way. Let me count outcomes a different way. And now I've made a second comparison. And now the P value is 0.2. Suppose the first group I was testing a high blood pressure medicine, and the first group asked, how low did the blood pressure go? No difference. In the second comparison, I asked, well, what was the average change in the blood pressure, not the biggest change in the blood pressure? Still no difference. Well let me say, well, let me ask the question, what was the lowest blood pressure on Fridays? Wow, boy, that's pretty interesting, because the lowest blood pressure on Fridays has a P value of 0.053. So maybe this drug does something special on Fridays. So let me now ask the question, what about the effect of the drug on Fridays in women? Man, look, I have a P value of 0.017 and I've already told you that a P value of less than 0.05, I'm going to that that's not a chance event, that's a real drug effect. So now I'm going to say, now I have a real drug effect. This drug lowers blood pressure well on Fridays in women. Well, that's stupid, obviously, for many reasons. One of which is nobody would think a drug operates differently on Fridays than another day, usually. But the main point of showing this is that the more comparisons you make, the more likely it is you're going to find a set of differences that are different by chance. But unless you recognize that you're making multiple comparisons, you won't accept that by chance. Now this is an example where we use four comparisons. In some of the genetic testing that I'm going to talk about when we get to genome-wide association studies for example, we end up testing 500,000 or a million times. So you really have to accept the idea that if you do a million tests, 50,000 of those are going to be positive by chance alone. We have to take into account this multiple comparisons question.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/ri0SV/genetics-definitions-part-ii-types-of-genetic-variants","Genetics Definitions, Part II & Types of Genetic Variants","[MUSIC] Well, we finished the last module by talking about the potential functional consequences of a change in DNA and how that might affect function of proteins. So in this module I'll go through the kinds of changes in DNA that we actually see in individual patients. So before I start let's come back to the chromosomes. I showed you this picture before. So again, chromosome 1 is the longest of the autosomes, chromosome 22 is the shortest and then there's the sex chromosomes, so a total of 46 chromosomes per human cell with the exception of sperm cell and egg cell which have 23. So it turns out that the longest chromosome is chromosome 1 it has 247 million base pairs. And that encodes around 2,800 genes. So again, most of the coding region, most of the molecule is occupied by non-coding DNA. And that non-coding DNA serves a regulatory function, it tells when genes should be turned on and turned off in specific cell types. So the total is shown on this slide here and I'm not going to go through each chromosome, you can read it. But the total is around 3 billion base pairs per 23 chromosomes, so 6 billion base pairs in a human cell, and around 25,000 genes. And as I told you before that means more than 25,000 proteins. because many genes can be alternatively spliced to create different kinds of proteins. Now, that's the way it is in each cell. And if the DNA sequences in each cell, in each person on the face of the planet, were exactly the same, then we would all look the same. We would all have very similar susceptibility to disease. We would have very similar responses to drugs. Notice I'm not saying it's identical because a lot of our susceptibility to disease and to our drug responses might be due to nongenetic factors. But to the extent that those kinds of characteristics of human beings, what we call phenotypes, are determined by genetics, they will be similar if the genetic material is the same. Now we know that we're not the same, we know that we don't have same susceptibility to disease, we know we don't have the same facial appearance, we don't have the same heights, we don't have the same disease susceptibilities. So there is lots and lots of variation across DNA molecules that we're beginning to understand now. And some of that variation occurs at the level of chromosomes and some of it occurs at the level of single DNA nucleotide pairs on A or T, C or a G, that's changes something else. That's the point of this module. So all the genetic material in the individual is called a genome. A genome can be a person's genome. It could be plants have genomes. Peas and rice have genomes. In fact, the rice genome is more complicated than the human genome. There are about 60,000 genes in the rice genome. The chimpanzee genome very similar to the human, in fact, the dog DNA is very similar. The dog genome is very similar to the humans about 98% similar or something like that. T-Rex has genetic material but I don't think anyone's made a T-Rex out of old genetic material despite the movies. Mammoth DNA is available and there is actually thoughts that you could actually use that DNA to recreate mammoths even though they are extinct now. And the man holding the skull. The skull is a Neanderthal. The man is a famous scientist whose laboratory studies the Neanderthal DNA and the extent to which our current DNA contains little stretches of Neanderthal DNA embedded in it. So all the genetic material in an individual human being is called the genome. So here is a set of chromosomes and they look pretty much similar to the 22 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes that I showed you before. But you'll notice that chromosome 21, there are not 2 copies but 3. And the way, this is a pretty common abnormality and it results in Down Syndrome. And the problem in Down Syndrome is that the children have intellectual impairment of varying degrees. They have other problems including cardiovascular problems and interestingly they all seem to look the same. And then, the way in which an extra copy of a chromosome confers this kind of abnormality is not really fully understood. But it's the kind of abnormality that shows that DNA can vary from individual to individual, even at the chromosome level. Here's another example of the way in which DNA might vary at the chromosome level. This is chromosome 9 and chromosome 22. The normal versions are shown on one side of the slide. Then what happens is a little tail of chromosome 22 inserts itself into chromosome 9. A little tail of chromosome 9 inserts itself into chromosome 22. By doing that, the stretch of DNA at the intersection on chromosome 22 which is now tiny. It makes a new gene. And that new gene turns out to turn on leukemia. So it's been known for decades that the presence of this funny little chromosome 22, which is called the Philadelphia chromosome, because it was 1st described in Philadelphia, is the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia. That's been known for a long time. With the advent of sequencing technologies we've come to understand what the mechanism for this abnormality is and more importantly we've come to understand that that new gene is what turns on the leukemia. So if you have a medicine that can turn off the function of that gene, you might be able to cure leukemia and there are, in fact, such medicines that have become available over the last 10 to 15 years. The most prominent example is a drug called Gleevec which I'll talk about in one of the later modules. This is an illustration of human chromosomes that are stained for the BCR product and the ABL product that are shown on the top. The BCR and the ABL are in green and red and you can see that the arrow points to a tiny little chromosome, that's the Philadelphia chromosome that has both the green and the red staining on it. So that's what turns on leukemia. And there are other kinds of abnormalities that are gross structural rearrangements of individual proteins, or individual chromosomes that are shown here. Translocations, duplications, inversions, substitutions, and deletions. And each one of those can be seen under the microscope and usually results in some easily detectable human phenotype. But a lot of the DNA variation that we see actually occurs at a much more microscopic level, and it can occur most commonly at the level of a single base pair. So we can have deletions, we can have insertions, and we can have substitutions. And since we understand that it's the sequence of DNA, that results in the sequence of messenger RNA that then gets translated into proteins. If these changes occur in the coding region of a gene they can result in major changes in the amino acid sequence. And if they occur in noncoding regions they can still result in changes in which that gene product is regulated. It might be turned on in the wrong place, it might be turned off in the wrong place. Not enough of it might be made. So here is the cartoon that I showed before of how a messenger RNA molecule binds to these little transfer RNA molecules. Each one of which is carrying an amino acid that amino acid gets made into a string of amino acids which in turn creates a protein. So let's pretend that we have a single change in a single base pair in DNA that results in a single change in the messenger RNA and results in a change in this particular instance in one single amino acid. So that's what's called a single nucleotide polymorphism. We talk about those as snips and there are tens of millions of snips when we compare my genome to the genome of another person walking down the street. We're different in tens of millions of places. Many of them do not very much, some of them change the amino acid, and many of them, those will change the function of the protein in ways that we're beginning to understand. Here's another example. In this particular example the snip doesn't result in a change in the amino acid. It actually inserts what's called a stop codon. So some of those triplets encode not an amino acid, but a signal that says here is the end of the protein. And of course if you insert a signal that says here is the end of the protein earlier than it should be, you make a truncated protein. Sometimes those proteins can be functional if the truncation occurs almost at the end of the protein. And sometimes the truncation will result in a completely nonfunctional protein. And so that's called a nonsense mutation, the one above is called a missense mutation. And then, you can imagine other things that could happen. So for example, if you insert a single base pair, remember it's the sequence of three base pairs in a row followed by three base pairs follower by three base pairs that determines the amino acid sequence. So if you insert one base pair into the DNA, you insert one base pair into the Messenger RNA and then the whole reading frame, we call this the open reading frame, is thrown off. So the sequence of proteins, the sequence of amino acids that is encoded suddenly changes at the level of the insertion, and everywhere downstream. So you make a protein that has a completely different sequence, and that of course could result in abnormal function. So what do these genetic variants do, what are the tens of millions of variants that make me different from my next-door neighbor due to protein function? Well, as far as we know most of them do nothing. We're getting to the point and we'll talk about this when I talk about sequencing technologies, where we can actually do the experiment of comparing my sequence to somebody else's sequence. And we find millions and millions of places where we're different. And most of those may do something to function but we're just not sure yet. So mostly nothing right now and that's a very important lesson because if somebody has their DNA sequenced and finds that they have some variant they shouldn't get too excited because many of the variants do nothing. Sometimes the variants cause a rare disease and that's been the science of human genetics for the last several decades, tracking down what it is about genetic variation that causes certain kinds of inherited human diseases. And we'll talk about that in another module. Variation can predispose to a common disease or a rare disease. And variation can predispose to unusual reactions to drug. Those can be bad reactions to drugs but occasionally a sequence variation might make somebody unusually responsive in a good way. So here are pictures of two kinds of inherited diseases that are due to changes at the single nucleotide level. I used the term single nucleotide polymorphism before, the conventional term for a DNA change that causes, that is very rare and it causes a disease is a mutation. So in the earlier days of genetics there would be a distinction made between a mutation, which is a rare variant and a polymorphism, which is a much more common variant across the population. With the idea that polymorphisms don't do very much and mutations are highly penetrant. They cause disease a lot. The problem with that distinction is that we now know that there are many, many, many rare polymorphisms very, very rare polymorphisms that probably don't do very much. And there are some commoner polymorphisms that actually do have an effect on human disease. So the distinction between mutation and polymorphism is becoming a lot blurred but that's said these diseases illustrated here. One is the typical cholesterol deposits around the eyes that a disease called polynomial hypercholesterolemia caused by a single nucleotide change in usually the chain called the LDL receptor. We'll talk about that later and the other is a family where there's a father, a son, and two grandchildren. All of whom are very, very tall and have very, very long fingers. And if they could measure their wingspan like you probably can't see this on the camera, their wingspan is much longer than their height. And in most people the wingspan is about the same as the height. So that's a disease called marfan syndrome. Marfan causes this particular kind of appearance but the more important part of Marfan syndromes is that people are acceptable to rupture of the aorta of the vein blood vessel coming off the heart because of weakening of the aortic wall. That's also caused by a single nucleotide polymorphism or a mutation of rare variant in a gene called fibrillin. Those are diseases cause by single variation and here are two other examples of diseases cause by coming together of rare variance in a single individual. The chest X-ray shows the chest X-ray of a child with cystic fibrosis, and you may not be expert at looking at chest X-rays, but there are many, many abnormalities of that chest X-ray that show the lung congestion and the lung disease that people with cystic fibrosis get and is the usual cause of death of that disease. The other slide is a slide of a blood smear. Most of the blood cells there are normal, but you see occasional blood cells that have this funny, sickling appearance, and this is sickle-cell anemia, a common cause of anemia and morbidity and African-American populations. Both of those diseases arrived through a different kind of inheritance pattern due to two mutations in the same individual. So in the next and one of the subscript module, we'll be talking about the way and which these genetic diseases are passed on from one generation to another. [SOUND] [SOUND] >> [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/FwEwU/genetics-definitions-part-i","Genetics Definitions, Part I","[MUSIC] For this module, we're going to talk about the way in which peas and people remember and transmit information across generations. This is the structure of the DNA molecule and we'll be talking a little more about this in this module. So DNA is a long, long, long, long molecule. But in the body it's organized in the nucleus of each cell, the center part of each cell. Not as a long unwound piece of spaghetti, but wound up on structures called centromeres. And those structures then compact themselves into structures that are actually visible under the microscope called chromosomes. And a picture of the chromosome is shown at the top of this cartoon. So when you look at a nucleus of a human cell, you'll see 22 pairs of chromosomes plus one set of sex chromosomes, X and Y. If you have two X chromosomes that defines a female, and an X chromosome and Y chromosome define a male. The other 22 chromosomes come in pairs and those are called autosomes. The longest one is chromosome 1, the shortest one is chromosome 22. It's not a very imaginative numbering system. And that's the situation in each cell in the body with the exception of sperm cells and egg cells. Sperm cells and egg cells each have half of the complement of chromosomes, randomly choosing one of each pair of the autosomes and one sex chromosome in each sperm cell and in each egg cell. So when a sperm cell and egg cell come together to create a fertilized ovum, then you have a complete collection of 46 chromosomes, half from mother and half from father. And that's the mechanism for the heredity. And the fact is that DNA can reproduce itself, can replicate itself, through mechanisms that I mentioned in the earlier talk, and so that gives us an opportunity to create offspring. Now, here are two sets of chromosomes and they come together to generate one child. The blue chromosomes are from the father and the pink chromosomes are from the mother. And it could be any color, they're obviously not colored that way. What's interesting to notice here is that this is a male child because he has an x chromosome and a y chromosome and the y chromosome has to come from his father. And the father's Y chromosome had to have come from his father. And the grandfather's Y chromosome had to have come from his grandfather, so each male carries in him a Y chromosome that comes from his father's line, his father's father's father's father's father's line. And that becomes important when it comes time to figure out who we are in ancestral terms, where our forbearers came from. We can track that through the Y chromosome. It turns out there's also DNA that comes exclusively from the mother, and the DNA that comes from the mother is not in the nucleus where the chromosomes live. But actually in structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria are little energy factories that are not in the nucleus but in what we call the cytoplasm, the non-nucleus part of each cell. And in the mitochondria is a small ring of DNA called mitochondrial DNA and that comes exclusively from the mother. How does it come exclusively from the mother? Remember that when the sperm cell and the ovary come together, the sperm is tiny. It's just a little collection of DNA, where the egg cell has a nuclear and has a cytoplasm, so it's the cytoplasm of the egg cell that transmits the mitochondrial DNA from generation to generation. So your mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mitochondrial DNA is your mitochondrial DNA. We can track maternal lineage that way. This slide shows what we call the central dogma of modern genetics. The central dogma is that the information that we want to use to transmit from generation to generation is contained in DNA, is encoded in DNA in ways in which I will talk about in a moment. The DNA itself can be copied. It can be copied to make other DNA molecules. It can also be copied to make a single strand copy of itself called RNA. RNA looks much like DNA, you can see it looks like a single strand as opposed to a double strand so it's a template obviously. And the four baeis, the As, Cs, Ts, and Gs that make up DNA are shown with the DNA molecule. The same four bases make up RNA except we refer to the T as a U. Instead of Thymadine we call it Uridine because it's a different chemical. But the T and the U serve similar functions in RNA and DNA. RNA then serves as a template from which proteins can be made. And it's proteins that do all the work in our body. Proteins that make up the structure of our body so that we have collagen proteins and hair proteins and nail proteins. Proteins that do work like heart contraction or thinking or eye color, all of those are proteins, proteins in the liver that chew up food as we digest. Every function that you can think of in your body is really a function of proteins. And proteins are made up of also fundamental building blocks. Not A, C, T, and G or A, C, A, C, G, and U, but fundamental building blocks called amino acids. And there are 20 amino acids. So each protein is a collection, a string of amino acids, and the amino acids that are selected for it in each protein are encoded in the DNA in ways in which I'll tell you about right now. So here is a long strand of DNA and that strand happens to encode a protein. We call that strand a gene. It turns out that most DNA does not encode proteins. Most DNA is what we call non-coding, and its job in life is to actually regulate the process whereby genes are translated into proteins through ways in which we are just beginning to understand now. So about one percent of all the DNA in each cell, actually encodes proteins. The way it works is that there are specific regions of DNA that are recognized as so-called promoter regions. Promoters allow, a set of molecules called RNA polymerase to bind. And what RNA polymerase does is two things. It unwinds the DNA, and when it unwinds the DNA it also creates a copy as you can see on the bottom cartoon here. And each strand of DNA serves as a template for creating a single strand of RNA. The RNA is made in the nucleus because that's where DNA lives. The RNA is then exported from the nucleus Into the cytoplasm. It's called messenger RNA. And messenger RNA is then translated into proteins. So this is the structure of a gene, and again, the details become important, not the entire sequence encodes a protein, only a piece of the sequence. Actually, usually a minority of the sequence. So a gene can be a very, very long structure, over hundreds of thousands of base pairs of DNA, and yet the coding region of that gene could just be a thousand or 2,000 based pairs with a lot of intervening sequences. So when message our RNA gets made from DNA we get a very, very, very long string. And each string consists of coding regions that we call exons and intervening regions between the coding regions that are called introns. I've drawn them here showing them at roughly the same size, but in fact, introns are generally much much larger than exons. So this is what's called a pre-messenger RNA molecule. It's an exact copy of the entire gene, intervening sequence, exons, and then a little bit of sequence at the upstream part and the downstream part. So that this pre-messenger RNA molecule that undergoes a process called splicing. And splicing then results in deletion of all the intronic material and a sequence of messenger RNA that will encode a protein. And it's shown here as these five little green blocks. They're slightly different colors, just to show the exons as they come out of the pre-messenger RNA. Now, that's one way of splicing. But it turns out splicing can also result in different messenger RNA sequences. So here's an example of splicing where that big green blob in the middle of the exon three is deleted. So we have a different messenger RNA that has a different sequence and will encode a different protein. In this way one gene can encode multiple different proteins, sometimes with quite different function. So the way it works is the messenger RNA is then exported to the cytoplasm where a structure called a ribosome attaches to the messenger RNA, and beings to translate the code, the A, C, G, and U code into proteins. Each three letter code is called a codon and each three letter code encodes a single amino acid. A structure called transfer RNA attaches itself to each three letter code, and each transfer RNA molecule carries a different amino acid. So in this particular sequence, each RNA molecule which comes from DNA then translates into a unique protein sequence and generates a protein. As the ribosome moves down the message RNA the protein gets longer and longer and longer as each of it's single amino acid is added until you have a fully formed protein. This slide shows the way in which the messenger RNA bases the A, C, G, and U combined in triplets to encode 1 of 20 individual amino acids. Now, it turns out that there are four nucleotides in RNA, and they can combine in 64 different ways to make triplet codons. So, there's what's called redundancy in the genetic code. That is a UUU triplet encodes the amino acid phenylalanine, abbreviated here Phe. But a UUUC also encodes phenylalanine and you can see that for example arginine is CG and then anything. CGU, CGC, CGA, or CGG. So this is what's called redundancy in the genetic code. And it means that if there's a DNA change, the messenger RNA might be different, but the amino acid that is encoded might not be changed at all. And we'll come back to that in one moment. So after a string of protein is made, one cartoon in my cartoons have shown that it looks like spaghetti. There's a sort of floppiness to it. But in fact, proteins assume structure. Two common structures are what's called an alpha helix and it looks like a helix. And the other structure is called a beta-pleated sheet and it looks like a pleated sheet as in a cartoon. Those structures then come together to form a protein with some rigidity. Many proteins move around a little bit and they move around as they accomplish their function. You can see in that complicated cartoon of the protein where there's lots a little pockets and one of the things that happens is drugs for example can bind in those pockets. And one of the other things that can happen is that proteins bind to each other, to create giant multi-protein complexes. And it's the multi protein complexes that actually accomplish the function that the protein is designed to do like contract the heart or to digest a piece of food. So that's the idea. So let's come back to this string of amino acids that I showed you before, and remember the string is the sequence of amino acids. It comes from the sequence of the messenger RNA, and that in turns comes from the DNA that sits in the nucleus, and it carries the code. So in a liver cell there's some DNA molecules, some genes that are turned on and make messenger RNA and then make protein. In a heart cell it may be a different collection of genes. So not every single gene is expressed in every single piece of tissue, and that's one of the functions of the long non-coding regions of DNA to tell the cell which particular gene it should turn on at what particular time to make proteins. Now imagine there are changes in the DNA molecule. So some of those changes will be in the coding region. And, for example, there could be a little deletion of sequence of DNA. And if there's a deletion of the sequence, what might happen is that the protein would look different. You might be missing all those five or six amino acids in light gray. Will that make the same protein? Will it work the same way? It might not. And that, in turn might cause a disease, it might contribute to a disease, it might cause an unusual reaction to a drug. That's one sort of DNA variation that we'll be talking about a lot in this course. And commonest form of DNA variation is a variation in a single base pair. And if that variation occurs in the coding region of a gene, it can result in change in a single amino acid. That's indicated here by the little red arrow. That's one amino acid that's changed in its sequence. That could change the function of that protein drastically. Or could do nothing. [SOUND]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/6E23Y/introduction-to-personalized-medicine","Introduction to Personalized Medicine","[MUSIC] Welcome to this course on personalized medicine. Personalized medicine is getting a lot of press, and people are very interested in the idea that their medicine should be personalized. But in fact the idea that we take care of patients in a very highly individualized way is not something new. Hippocrates, the father of modern and ancient medicine, said it is more important to know what sort of person has a disease than to know what sort of a disease a person has. That's another way of saying that it's important to understand the patient and then you'll understand the disease. More recently, Sir William Osler, the father of modern medicine, a Canadian who went to Johns Hopkins to found the famous department of medicine there and ended at his career at Oxford, is widely quoted. I'll just read you the bottom quote. You can read the top one to yourself. The good physician treats the disease. The great physician treats the patient who has the disease. That's another way of saying that the great physician understands what it is about their patient that's special, that's individual, that's unique, and tries to tailor the therapy for them. So those ideas have been around for a long time. So the question is what is so special about this vogue for personalized medicine. So we've known forever that occasional patients seem different from the average somehow. How long they live, how susceptible or resistant they are to disease, how well they'll respond to drugs or how badly they'll respond to certain drugs. The excitement in personalized medicine is that we now have new tools with which to understand this variability and to exploit it. So one of the new tools is an understanding of the DNA molecule, and we'll talk about that in the next few modules. But it's important to understand that without the advent of modern computer technology, we would not be able to analyze the DNA sequences that we have, and understand how it is that those should be applied to individual patients. So, I think that the revolution in personalized medicine Is taking advantage of these two developments. One in the science of DNA, and the other in the science of managing large data sets. So large data sets are not just DNA, but other kinds of data sets. What you surf at Google, what your X-rays look like, what your Shopping habits are like it, and taken together, that is defining the new science of big data. And big data is another way of looking at very, very large data sets and trying to understand what it is about an individual person, a patient or a shopper that makes them different. We're all familiar with that from surfing the web, and you can imagine that you could surf your DNA web and do the same kind of individualization. Okay, so the promise of this personalized medicine, big data intersection is that we will learn more about disease susceptibility or response to drugs by looking at DNA patterns, by looking at patterns in electronic medical records, by looking at patterns of proteins that we can measure in blood samples, by looking at other kinds of large data sets to understand what it is that makes an individual special, and one of the things that we're going to use that for is to engage patients in their own care and their individualization. Now the problem there is that patients vary and their level of excitement around the concepts of personalized medicine. So people vary for many, many reasons that have very little to do with their health, their biological health, but have everything to do with their environment, the way they were brought up, their educational levels. People vary in their religious beliefs, some people really believe very, very deeply that certain forms of treatment should never be applied. Other people are willing to apply other forms of therapy. So the way you're brought up makes a difference in your attitude toward this new science of personalized medicine. The level of education makes a big difference. I show here a picture of a food label. Some people can look at that food label and grasp immediately the important information that they need for their own care. Other people can't read, so those food labels are not very useful to them. Many patients take more than one medicine. Here's a picture of a patient with many, many, many pill bottles. So some patients can handle taking 20 medicines. Other patients just don't have the intellectual or financial capacity to take 20 different medicines, all of them on different schedules, all of them with the potential of interacting with each other. So we have to individualize at the level of understanding these kinds of factors. And of course, the other factor that is making a huge difference is the level at which people have access to electronic media. Increasingly, we're seeing patients communicating with their doctors through the computer. We're seeing patients communicating, downloading information from the web, whether it's good or bad, and some patients have access to that information. Other patients don't. So that creates another opportunity for individualizing care based on what a patient can and wants to do. And so those are important pieces of the individualization or personalization puzzle. So my basic philosophy in designing this course has been to illustrate the potential of personalized medicine using a case based approach. We'll talk about individual clinical cases and how personalizing through genetics or other mechanisms can result potentially in improved care. The first few modules are going to deal with some principles in genetics and principles in drug therapy. Some of that will be elementary for those of you who have been to medical school, and I ask your indulgence. The goal is to get everyone up to speed so we can use common terminology and common concepts when it comes time to approach the cases. And after the cases we'll have a couple of modules on exactly how personalized medicine is being rolled out in healthcare systems. Thinking about the ethical issues a little bit, thinking about the issues around extensive, large, personalized databases, extensive, large electronic medical records, and some of the obstacles that people are encountering, when they're implementing those systems, and some of the potential solutions. So I thought I would start a little bit in this module with some very, very basic principles in genetics and mostly history. So we've known for a long time, actually since the middle of the 1700s that individuals vary in their fingerprints. Everybody has a unique fingerprint. That was actually discovered by a Czech physiologist named Purkinje, whose picture is shown here. And he came from this small central European republic which is now the Czech Republic. He came from near Prague. And that'll become important in a second. Now this picture shows two young men. They are, in fact, not the same person, but they look very much the same, and this illustrates the idea that genetic information, or information on how you look and how you respond to your environment is transmitted across generations and how is it that we transmit information from a parent to a child. The one in the straight pajamas is the son, the one in the blue and red sweater is the father. So this is why the Czech Republic is important, because in the nineteenth century a monk working in the Czech Republic in Moravia named Gregor Mendel developed the rules around which we understand genetic information is passed from one generation to another. Mendel's basic experiment was to breed peas together. So he would take peas and the pea, he would look at the characteristics of the peas. Now the word we use to describe the characteristics is the phenotype. So the phenotype that he was looking at was whether the peas are smooth or wrinkly, and he would mate smooth peas and wrinkly peas, and in the next generation, he would look, and all the peas were smooth. And then he would mate the smooth peas with each other. And out of every four pea plants, three of them would generate smooth peas and one of them would generate crinkly peas. He did this experiment over and over and over again, hundreds of times in fact, thousands of times, and developed rules that we now use to understand the way in which genetic information is transmitted from one generation to another, and we'll go over those in a subsequent module. So the next great advance in our understanding of the way information is transmitted from one generation to the next occurred in the early 1950s when these two young scientists, Crick and Watson, described the structure of a molecule they were studying. The name of the molecule is DNA. They published their article describing the structure of DNA in a single page in the Journal of Nature, and arguably won the Nobel Prize for that single publication. Here's a picture of that particular publication and what's interesting is that the cartoon drawing of the structure of DNA was actually drawn by Francis Crick's wife. There are two quotes that I think are really interesting in this article. One of the quotes is the very first sentence. The very first sentence says, we wish to suggest a structure for the salt of DNA. The structure has novel features which are of considerable biological interest. So these guys are structural biologists and they're studying this large molecule, and they know that it has something to do with heredity. But they actually, the way in which heredity works, the way in which information is transmitted from generation to generation is not known. And they saw the structure of DNA, and they look at the structure and they say ' wait a second. Now we understand how information might get transmitted from one generation to the next.' So from structure they infer function, and from function they infer mechanisms for heredity. The other sentence that is fabulous in this article is the last sentence of the science. And the last sentence is a real example of understatement, since it is not escaped or noticed that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possibly copying mechanism for the genetic material. So the problem is, how does anything transmit from one generation to the next. If it does that, there has to be a mechanism for the molecules to copy themselves. So here's the idea, this is the DNA molecule that we're all familiar with. Everybody likes to focus on the sides of the double helix, the double helices. But what's really interesting and what's the workhorse in this molecule is actually the little rungs of the ladder that are connecting those two double helices. And the way it works is that there are four components to those rungs of the ladder. We abbreviate them A, C, T, and G. C and G always talk to each other, and A and T always talk to each other. So when there's a T on one strand, there will be an A on the other strand. That's called base pairing, and the things that hold those two base pairs together are indicated in this cartoon by dots. Those dots indicate a chemical bond, but it's not a very strong chemical bond. So what Crick and Watson recognized is that it's not a strong chemical bond, and that means it could fall apart. If it falls apart, the molecules starts to unwind, and then each side becomes a template for creating daughter strands so they look at this structure and they say ' isn't that interesting.' If this happens then each daughter strand can copy it's self and we have a mechanism by which Information might be transmitted from one generation to the next. We'll talk more about that in subsequent modules. [SOUND]",""

[MUSIC] I'm a faculty member at Vanderbilt University Medical Center where I've spent the last three plus decades as an investigator and as a physician. Here at Vanderbilt, we made an institutional commitment to the concept of personalized medicine, largely around the genetics of variable drug response, although that vision is now expanding into disease susceptibility as well. We made that commitment about ten years ago. Part of the reason we made that commitment is because of the long standing tradition of excellence in clinical pharmacology. Another part of that reason is the longstanding commitment to information science, and particularly to the way in which we use varied information across many, many genes, and couple that to the electronic medical record. Something that we'll talk about in this course. The reason that I'm teaching this course is that I think we've seen an explosion In our understanding of the concepts of personalized medicine over the last decade. That explosion has come along with the ability to sequence patients and generate large volumes of genetic data, as well as our understanding of the way in which genes affect our disease susceptibility. Many patients come to us for many conditions, and they take many, many different medicines, and the potential for interaction across diseases and across drugs is great. And so the idea is a personalized medicine is to do the best we can based on the evidence that we have, be it from genetics or be it from large clinical trials to deliver the best of individual loss care for that patient. [MUSIC] The main target audience for this course are physicians who have been in practice for five or more years. Those physicians are increasingly exposed to the concepts of personalized medicine, and genomic base personalized medicine. But don't have the medical school background that enables them to critically look at the literature and understand when it is important to apply that information. And when it may not yet be important to apply that information. Now that's the main target audience but of course, other physicians, medical students, other healthcare professionals, undergraduate students, interested members of the life public are all welcome to take the course. There will be a couple of introductory, modules around the fundamental principles of personalized medicine. The history of personalized medicine, the history of genetics. But the majority of the course are modules based on individual cases and individual examples that highlight specific genetic variance that may be important, or are important for the care of individual patients. And we'll end the course by some modules looking towards the future. The course itself will be a total of six weeks. There will be quizzes. There will be discussions. And there will be a final project at the end of the course. So welcome to this course on Personalized Medicine. I look forward to having you participate in this course, and hope that you get something great out of it. Thank you. [MUSIC]",""

It's very simple in a way. It's like you or I, who occasionally may have to go for a health checkup. If we haven't been for a while or we've been to a new doctor, they will often hand us a form. And on that form they'll say, please check any issues that you feel are affecting your health. So you'll go through and maybe talk about having a backache or stomach problem or something. The doctor then will take that information and base a conversation with you around it. It's what they call the diagnostic phase. You have presented them with some symptoms. They then will go through a period of diagnosis with you, exploring what might be behind those. And then if all goes according to plan, they will present you or you'll discuss with them a form of treatment that will deal with those symptoms. So similarly, in the case of boards of non-profit organizations, we don't pretend to be medical experts or anything like that, but we do have the same idea. So, we asked people who are actually members of boards and who connect to boards, relate to boards, how they perceive the organization in terms of symptoms, issues, challenges, problems that might be affecting their board. We then, in our course, walk you, the participants through a diagnostic process. Ways of thinking about those symptoms, why they exist? What are the causes of them? And finally, in each segment of the course, you'll move on to what possible treatments are there for these symptoms? That is to say, what might be done to get over these kinds of problems? So, that's what you're going to be experiencing for the next little while.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nonprofit-gov-3/lecture/4aYM9/conceptual-framework-of-the-elements-of-board-effectiveness","Conceptual Framework of the Elements of Board Effectiveness","Hi, Yvonne Harrison here from the Department of Public Administration and Policy at the University at Albany. In this video, I interview Professor Vick Murray, a co-instructor in this course, about the elements of board effectiveness that underlie the course, our guidebook, and the tool that you'll be using to assess the performance of boards through the semester project. >> So let's start over here on the far right-hand side, the right-hand side box, which attempts to list all the different ways that boards can have an impact on the effectiveness of the organization. So they include things like this. The board's work can have an impact on the achievement of the organization's mission. They can certainly have an impact on the financial condition of the board. The efficiency of the organization, the ability of the organization to learn and innovate, that's a very important requirement for organizations these days. The morale and motivation of staff and volunteers in the organization, and very importantly, the external, the satisfaction of external stakeholders and the reputation of the organization in the community. So those are the ways that organizations may have an impact on the success of the organization. Now how does it do that? We group the answer to that question under two headings. The basic board responsibilities in the governance process, in the middle box here, and factors that influence that governance process, on the far left hand box. Let's go to the middle box. Here we're talking about issues that relate to, for example, the overall clarity of the board's responsibilities. One of the biggest problems is boards that aren't clear about what they're supposed to do, or have a different view of that from managers and external stakeholders. A very crucial responsibility for boards is planning and setting very broad general policies to guide the organization planning for its future. A third crucial area of board responsibility has to do with meeting its due diligence requirements, ensuring those for whom they are trustees that the organization is being run in a fiscal and legally responsible manner, and not engaging in risks that are a detriment to its future. Finally, there is the board area of responsibility, dealing with its role in fundraising, always a very difficult and controversial sort of area. So those are things the board mostly has to focus on being responsible for. The next question is, well, in what ways does their ability to carry out these responsibilities, and what ways are they affected by the way they operate?. Factors that influence the government's process. Here we see it's just grouped in to five categories, five groups. The first has to do with the overall formal structure of the board and its formal operating procedures. So all the non-profits, at least those that are formally organized and recognized by states or provinces or countries, that they must have certain bylaws, they must have certain positions, such as president, chairmen of committees, treasurers, etc. And they usually, although not all, have committees. And it's a question as to how well those committees work. Are they the right ones? Are they performing well? The next group of factors that influence performance has to do with the very important matter of the board meetings. Sometimes it seems as though board meetings are the only thing that boards do. In fact, they do a lot of other things that are not in meetings, but having effective meetings is certainly very important. Then there is the question of having the right mix of people on the board, the composition of the board and how well the board learns, engages in training, and development of itself. Less talked about in the literature, and less aware in the minds of many people, is the fact that boards do develop, informally, their own culture. That is to say taken for granted attitudes, perceptions, views of the world that color the way they talk and think and make decisions. Very important to be aware of that, and when we look at what influences culture, two of the most important aspects are the leadership provided to the board by two crucial roles, the CEO, and so far as there is a paid professional manager, or if not one, if it's a small organization, a volunteer who plays that role, and the chair of the board. These are two of the most important leadership factors. So, to just review. Boards are trying to have an impact on the organization, they have to do this by engaging in a certain number of responsibilities, certain kinds of responsibilities, and if they don't do certain aspects of the process well, then the whole thing can come apart. Finally, not that we're gonna be able to go into great length on this in the course, but one must be aware that there are influences on all three of these boxes. We call them contingency factors. So the fact that a given organization is made up of a certain set of individuals or of a certain age, a certain gender, a certain experience, a certain racial or ethnic background, having varying amounts of time, different kinds of personalities, can have quite an effect on all these issues. There are also certain characteristics that the organization of which the board is a part. Its size, its age, its particular mission, its financial situation, its history, all of those can also have an impact. And finally, there are very important characteristics like the organization's external environment. These are allies, potential allies, or regulators, clients, the public in general. All of whom can have certain characteristics at a given point in time and can also have a big impact on how these three boxes connect, and come to a final impact on the organization. We won't be able to go into all of those. We're gonna focus on the things that can be done by boards by themselves to improve their own performance. But our research, which you'll be hearing about, does try to trace the way these contingency factors influence these other aspects of board functioning.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nonprofit-gov-3/lecture/cScDh/week-1-guest-interview-with-will-brown-on-board-engagement","Week 1 Guest Interview with Will Brown on Board Engagement","[MUSIC] I'm here today with Will Brown, associate professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University. Will is one of the leading researchers in the governance of nonprofit organizations in the United States. And he's here today to share some information about his new book and his research. Thanks for being with us today, Will. >> Hi Yvonne. It's good to be talking with you again. >> Will, let me ask you a question I asked Chris when I interviewed him about the book. What, what's new about this book in the world of nonprofit governance? >> The book provides a compilation of scholarly thought on nonprofit governance which has seen unprecedented growth. There are more researchers asking interesting questions and learning significant insights into nonprofit governance than ever before. The growth and understanding over the last ten years is substantial. And there was not any resource that captured the most compelling thought leaders on the subject. Now, we didn't get everybody, but we were able to engage a number of significant scholars. Chris Cornforth, being among them, to contribute to the book. We believe the book improves our understanding of nonprofit governance. >> How is the book relevant for board members, CEO, staff, and students who are looking to lead and manage a nonprofit governance? >> The book presents a number of different models and frameworks that students, practitioners, and consultants can apply to their work. Take, for example, the chapter by Bradshawn Tatiana. It introduces a systems perspective to explore governance in complex organizations. These organization typically have chapters or affiliated entities with their own local boards. The idea that governance systems are nested within bigger systems is compelling, and incredibly powerful to explain functional and dysfunctional practices. The chapter explores why some of these regional groups are in conflict with headquarters and how the practices of, practice of governance plays out. We're not providing specific advice for what any particular organization should do. The chapter illustrates how different developmental histories have contributed to blindness. Either at the headquarters, we're not really understanding how local group cohesiveness is instrumental to organizational activities or blindness at the chapters, who don't necessarily appreciate the headquarters attempt to control or guide practices. It is a fascinating read that provides insight into complex governance practices. That is sure to enfor, board members, executives and consultants on how they work with boards. >> Will, you wrote the fifth chapter on board member engagement. What does this chapter add to the book? >> The book has five parts. Chris and I tried to cover the landscape of governance issues. Part one provides review of the field and considers different theoretical approaches. Part two, where this chapter and yours, Yvonne, are located, addresses the individual board member. The book continues through increasing levels of complexity, considering group dynamics within the board, organizational structures and multilevel governance systems. As an organizational psychologist, I always come back to the individual, and how they approach their work. It is the foundation for all that happens in an organization. How do individuals engage, or not in their role as a board member? This is something we talk about all the time, but surprisingly rigorous empirical research is relatively limited in this context. So the chapter summarizes current thinking from various disciplines and psychology, organizational behavior and management to inform the model. What I've done is placed that research within the context of nonprofit boards to suggest how executives can help board members to be more full, fully engaged. A really important factor is role clarity. For example, a recent survey of board members and CEOs conducted by board source called leading with intent, shows that upwards of 50% of board members are not really sure what they are supposed to do. It's kind of crazy, right? We have all these very intelligent and talented people in organizations that need good leadership. But far too many board members are unclear on what they are supposed to do. This is very frustrating and disappointing for everyone. As a result, they disengage. They stop coming to meetings or they come but provide little input. So the chapter explains the social psychological processes at work and how managers and board members might become more fully engaged. This will make the board more effective and that's why the chapter is important. >> Well, in your chapter, you describe a model of the antecedents to board member engagement. Can you explain this model to us and how it can be used to better understand the engagement of board members in governance? >> The model details, four factors that is likely to support engagement. Which is defined as an individual's readiness to fully participate. Engagement is one sense that I'm here, I'm attentive, and I'm ready. I reference one of these factors already, task ownership, which is accepting and understanding your job as a board member. The second is values congruence, which is an alignment between the individual and the organizational purposes. Third is perceived ability. One's sense that they are capable to perform. The fourth is trust and safety, which reflects a sense of comfort with the group and others around you. These four factors work together to create an engaged board member. Managers and board members can reinforce these factors to support individual engagement. There are two other factors in the model that can mediate actual performance. Just because somebody is ready doesn't mean they will participate. These other factors are related to the context and include group dynamics and meeting management practices. Let me provide an example of how all these factors work together in the model. Many of us have been in a meeting, ready to participate, fully engaged. We believe in the purpose of the organization, have a good sense of what needs to be done. We're more or less confident about our ability to participate. And basically, we trust those around us. But somehow, we're never allowed to participate. The endless droning on of a committee report, for instance, that leaves no time for discussion. As a group member, I'm ready to participate, but no one takes the time to gather comments or facilitate a discussion. So the model suggests a number of things people can do to support active participation. By seeing engagement of board members is a central but not sufficient to performance. There's a lot going on on the model and many of these issues are complex. But the chapter provides specific propositions to help managers modify how their boards operate. So they can support engagement and ultimately board member participation. Assuming of course, that's what we want but that's another conversation. >> Finally, your chapter's going to be the subject of a peer-to-peer discussion at the end of this week. Can you suggest some questions to help frame a conversation on board member engagement? >> The chapter and my comments suggest a number of important issues in nonprofit governance. Students might like to reflect on the following questions. One, do you find that most board members fully understand what they need to do? Why do you say that? And what might contribute to that condition? And number two, as you reflect on the model, antecedents to board member participation, what aspects of the model could you put into practice with your board, and why do you say that? >> Thank you, Will, for being with us today for sharing your research in this exciting new book. >> Thanks Yvonne. I've enjoyed talking with you. I hope the course is going well. [MUSIC] [SOUND]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nonprofit-gov-3/lecture/8aapq/week-1-lecture","Week 1 Lecture","[MUSIC] Hi, Professor Yvonne Harrison here, from the Department of Public Administration and Policy at the University at Albany. On behalf of Professor Vic Murray from the University of Victoria, we want to welcome you to course 3, The Factors that Influence the Effectiveness of Boards and the Governance Process. The focus of this course is on the often unrecognized influences on how well a board carries out its governance role and responsibilities. This lecture addresses two key influences, the board's structures and operating procedures In meetings of the board. For this lecture we will draw primarily from chapters six and seven of our open textbook Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations. We will also be referring to one of the required text and a recommended text. The required text is Chait, Ryan and Taylor's Governance is Leadership and the recommended text is Cornforth's and Brown's Nonprofit Governance. And don't worry if you don't have this textbook. I have summed up the key elements and points made as it relates to these influences in the lecture. As in other weeks, the course page contains the readings, the resources, and homework to be completed by the end of the week. Now let's begin. Here are the questions this lecture will address. 1, what factors influence the effectiveness of nonprofit boards of directors? 2, what are board procedures and structures and why are they important? 3, why do boards experience problems with inadequate procedures and structures? And 4, how could a board go about changing its procedures and structures to increase its effectiveness? 5, what issues challenge the effectiveness of board meetings? 6, what can be done to increase the effectiveness of board meetings. And finally we'll end with questions to inform your peer-to-peer discussions this week. The question asks what factors influence the effectiveness of nonprofit boards of directors. And what I want to do is draw your attention to this conceptual framework of the elements of board effectiveness that underlie this course, our SUNY Open Guidebook and the tool, the board check-up, that many of you are using to assess the performance of a board that you know. And let me just start to the right of the framework with the nonprofit organization effectiveness. And for many of you who have registered for this specialization and taken the first course, you'll realize that that first course in the specialization had to do with nonprofit organizations, nonprofit leadership and the board's role in organizational governance. So this depicts the relationship between nonprofit governance, effectiveness, and the effectiveness of nonprofit organizations, acknowledging that boards contribute some but not all of the variants in the effectiveness of a nonprofit organization, that other factors in the environment internally and externally will also contribute. The second course, we examine the governance process and specifically the role and responsibilities of boards of directors in organizational governance. And that's that second what text box in this framework. The board's basic role, fiduciary role and responsibilities, its role and responsibilities in planning, performance assessment, and resource development. And in this third course, we're looking again at some of these unrecognized influences that affect how well boards carry out their role and their responsibilities in governance. And here we've highlighted two influences that we'll address this week. And that's the board's structures and operating procedures, and meetings of he board. What are board procedures and structures and why are they important? Well in a nutshell all boards of directors have some form of organization that helps support the way the board operates but also constrain it. These are specified in constitution and bylaws, which, if this organization is incorporated or required by law. And these documents provide important information about who could be part of the board, the authority of the board, and how it makes decisions. Also operating procedures are also specified in manuals, in board manuals, in board position descriptions. And they're also supported by the organization with the amount of support it provides to facilitate governance. Issues often arise when boards fail to review these procedures or to update them when either the law changes or the organization changes, or these procedures are set and are too rigid to allow the board the flexibility that it needs to carry out its role. For example, with term limits, if people must leave the board and there's a need to keep people in key positions, officer positions that the procedures allow for this flexibility. There are important aspects of board structures that can have an influence on how the board carries out its role and responsibilities. And one of them is board size, the number of people who serve on the board and this will be specified in the bylaws. And size is an important source of resources for the board. The number of people who serve can represent constituents. And the public diversity of the publics that the organization serves can be important linkage to the external environment, with large boards providing more resources and a greater linkage. But the flipside of that is the fact that large boards are likely to break into a smaller group of core leaders and so not all members would be engaged equally, and that it would be more difficult to provide boards and board members that are large with meaningful roles for everyone, whereas smaller boards might be able to provide this Greater meaning and greater engagement involvement, but then the flipside of that is that they are less representative. Less able to bring in resources. Maybe less aware of what's going on externally. Another structure board offices and these are the key leadership and administrative functions that must be performed and often times without adequate training and information in key positions like the chair or the vice chair or the treasurer who provides important financial oversight responsibility for the board. Or the secretary who provides an important record keeping in documentation retention functions really don't have adequate information or training to carry out those roles effectively, and then they become, really, just ceremonial. Board committees can also have an effect on how the board carries out its role and responsibilities. There are basically two types of committees. Policy committees, which relate directly to the governance function. And these are small kind of problem-solving groups, which can look at or study important issues for the board and produce reports or information to bring back to the whole board for recommendation and decision. And there are also working committee types and these are policy implementation groups. There are also standing committees which consist of either policy or working group committees and these would also be specified in the organization's bylaws. There are some recommendations that these be kept to a minimum. And in fact some people are recommend replacing them with task forces or special project groups that have a specific focus and are time bound. It's important to keep in mind that all of these structures will vary by the type of organization and the governance model. So whether the organization is following a policy or a governance only model or is a working type of board with non or few paid staff or a mixed model where it sometimes gets involved in operational matters and sometimes not. There are two sets of factors that can help explain why boards experience problems in this area of operating procedures and structures, and our chapter addresses these factors primarily the internal factors, but the chapter by David Mullins Chapter 11 on the evolution of corporate governance structures and relationships in English housing associations. And this is in Cornforth and Brown book, Nonprofit Governance. It also speaks to these factors internally and externally. So internally, as an organization professionalizes and grows, a board that fails to review and update rules is more likely to experience problems in this area. It could also be that the board really isn't aware of the influence that structures and procedures have on governance behavior, or it could be that the leadership of the organization and the board or the culture of dominant core group could actually reinforce the existing structures and procedures in place and inhibit change on the board. But externally, and this is where David Mullins' case study is very important, you have macro level factors, so changes in the external environment going on. And in his case he's talking about the merging of housing associations into larger non-profit organizations and changes in regulation and how those organizations are governed. And so the rules and codes of governance having changed could really be a source of some of the issues that boards experience in this area. Well, either way, boards that fail to assess performance are most at risk for experiencing problems in this area. How could a board go about changing its operating procedures and structures? Well, a good place to begin is with board performance assessment and use of a diagnostic like the Board Check-Up, which has been designed to surface issues that inhibit governance effectiveness and to help boards make changes in the governance process. Over the last few slides, we talked about board operating procedures and board structures, and this diagnostic will surface issues related to them. The next step really is for the board to discuss whether these issues exist, why they exist and to make some decisions around what to do about them. And this is where the Suni open textbook our guidelines for improving the effectiveness of nonprofit boards of directors could come in handy and all board members really should have a copy of this free open book and that should help the board in making decisions to improve performance in this area. This leads us into the second part of the lecture on board meetings. And the question here on what issues challenge the effectiveness of board meetings? Well, for people who may be new to non-profit governance, many may think that it is in official meetings where governance takes place. But we know from the previous part of this lecture that much of the work takes place before and after meetings in committees and other activities. But meeting quality can influence the ability of the board to carry out its strategic leadership role and that official meetings of the board really should focus on issues that have implications for the strategic direction of the organization, or that create understanding about an issue or situation the organization is facing. In this part of the lecture, I'll cover some of the issues that challenge board meeting effectiveness in the area of the meeting agenda and supporting information, meeting content, decision making, and meeting attendance. This slide sums up the key questions that underlie the issues that challenge the effectiveness of board meetings in five issue areas. The meeting agenda organizes the content of the meeting. Issues that challenge meetings in this area have to do with the agenda. Is there an agenda? Will people receive that agenda in advance of the meeting or is it distributed during the meeting? Does the agenda have a clear purpose? How is it organized and is it full of routine matters? There's also a need for supporting in it information to accompany the agenda so that people are on the same page. When an agenda items come up. Key questions here are do people have enough information to be adequately prepared for the meeting? Do they have to much information? And boards really need to consider how much is the right of known of the information for people to be prepared. One of the most common problems with board meetings is that too much time is spent listening to reports or discussing matters that could be better discussed by the CEO or a committee of the board. And this is the subject or the area of meeting content. Some of the key questions to consider when planning a meeting are what is the substance of the meeting? How should the board spend its time during the meeting? Which items are for information only, and which items are for decision? Even when the agenda and the meeting content are well designed, board meetings can be less successful if the decision making process is flawed. Some of the key questions here are, are motions clearly stated and understood? How participatory are board discussions, or are they taken up by a core group of dominant talkers? Is it clear who will implement board decisions and when? And how effective is board decision-making? When decisions are made does a board check on and see whether they've been implemented? If there are any issues at board meetings it might show up in the area of needing attendance. Are meetings poorly attending, is there tendency to blame individuals for not attending the meetings? Is the board looking at its meeting performance to see whether improvements can be made? The question of whether meeting effectiveness can be improved is answered in the results of the research that Murray and I did on the effects of online board performance assessment on changes in governance of behavior and practices. And you can see a summary of those changes on this slide in the different dimensions of board effectiveness assessed. And the most frequently cited change, and these are changes that board implemented, is in the area of board meetings. And changes in board meeting planning, agendas and the adopting of consent agendas to move routine matters quickly through the agenda. And also changes in meeting content and discussions, with more attention to governance issues and less on routine matters. The second most frequently cited change was in the area of board structures and operating procedures, and you will see here that 82% of boards that made changes in governance behavior and practice did so in this area by updating their constitution and by laws, introducing and improving governance information. So they're meaning supporting information, and systems, and establishing board policies and procedures to manage things like conflict of interest. You can scroll through the different dimensions and see some of the changes that boards have made following board performance assessment. And for more information about this research and our findings, do look to the article on the course page by myself Murray In the nonprofit and voluntary sector, quarterly. I wanted to conclude this lecture by tying the significance of these two factors to governance, and their influence on the different modes of governance that Chait, Ryan, and Taylor described in their book, Governance as Leadership. And I think you're gonna see a relationship between a Type 1 fiduciary board, a board that tends to spend most of its time in oversight as being very rule based, and very formal, and perhaps rubber stamping in its decisions and the decisions brought to it by management. And as you move through to the strategic governance and even to generative governance supports becoming more flexible in their procedures and structures to optimize the inputs of the board. And to, also, as we head now into generative governance, to suspend the formality all together when the board is addressing certain issues. And you'll see on page 111 in governance leadership these are landmark issues that really signify to the board that there's an opportunity for generative governance. But also at board's really working beyond the board room and being at the boundary of the organization and its external environment. And the boards really bringing that working at the boundary to bring the outside into the boardroom. And so all of this is affected by the structures and the procedures and the way the board conducts its business. Here are the questions for peer-to-peer discussions this week. Our research showed 95% of boards made changes in board meetings following online self-assessment of board performance. Why do you think so many boards experience effectiveness challenges in the area of board meetings? Two, a number of treatments are described in our SUNY Open textbook guidelines to improving, the effectiveness of non-profit boards of directors in the area board meetings. In your experience, of these treatments, which have been the most effective? And are there any that we missed? And finally can you comment on the significance of the influence that board structures and procedures have on the ability of the board to carry out its role and responsibilities? That's it for this week, we'll see you in the forums. [MUSIC]",""

In this video, I will review the Capstone Project. I'll begin with the learning outcomes and the leadership competencies emphasized, and the options for undertaking the Capstone Project. I'll conclude with the learning activities within a timeline for starting and submitting your Capstone Project report. The Capstone Project is an academic service learning experience designed to help you apply the knowledge and skills acquired in the specialization courses to a real world governance and leadership situation, a non-profit board and organization as experiencing. It's also designed to help you develop your capability to be a positive agent for change in non-profit organizations. By the end of the Capstone Project, you will have produced a professional consulting report on the state of board performance. Whether you decide to work with the board you analyze through the specialization courses or whether you choose to use a new board to analyze, the Capstone Project is an opportunity to further assess performance, to demonstrate mastery of academic course concepts, to develop skills and to provide a valuable public service to help a board improve its leadership and further develop in governance and effectiveness. You should know that the Capstone Project emphasizes the leadership competencies in the specialization courses. You may recall that these leadership competencies are required by schools of public affairs that are accredited by NASPAA. And NASPAA is the Network of Schools of Public Affairs in North America. The following leadership competencies are emphasized in the Capstone Project. They are the ability to apply a public service perspective, to identify, analyze, and think critically about non-profit leadership and governance effectiveness challenges. To communicate and interact productively with and for others, and to lead a facilitate change in the governance process. It should be noted that these leadership competencies were developed with North American culture and academic requirements in mind. It is our hope, however, that they will be a value to those in other parts of the world. Now, I'll turn to the options and the steps involved for undertaking the Capstone Project. If you've reached this stage in the specialization, you've already completed the three courses and assessed a board's performance, and submitted your three bears, which required you to identify and learn about a non-profit organization and board that you know or a fictional one that we provided for you. For the Capstone Project, you can carry on working with the board of this organization or you can choose a new one. We recommend you do this, as a learning experience is much more impactful for you and the board. You will have eight weeks in which to complete the Capstone Project. In week one, access the detailed instructions on the requirements for completing the Capstone Project from the course page. Time should be spent reviewing these requirements and deciding on a board of a non-profit organization to work with. Weeks two and three is the time to share the Capstone Project tools and resources with boards of non-profit organizations you know. These includes the SUNY Open Textbook guidelines for improving the effectiveness of board of directors of non-profit organizations and the board check-up. The online board performance self-assessment tool. Once you have the cooperation of an organization and board, choose a point of contact to work with and sign them up for the check-up and begin the process of data collection. If you were unable to gain the cooperation of an organization and board, and must choose to work with one of our fictional boards, you will need to familiarize yourself with the data provided. In weeks four and five, the data you collected should be analyzed leading to an evaluation of the board's performance. In week six and seven, the final phase of the Capstone Project, the results of your evaluation should be synthesized and communicated. Recommendations for positive change should be brought together in the form of a specially prepared consulting report intended for use by the board of the client organization. In week eight, you will submit this report and participate in peer reviews evaluating and providing feedback on reports of your fellow students. Within the platform, you'll find detailed guides and resources on the steps involved in carrying out the work involved in the Capstone Project. In this video, we reviewed the fourth course, the Capstone Project. We reviewed the learning outcomes and the leadership competencies, and the options and activities that you'll engage in to undertake the Capstone Project.

And that is a very specific type of sequencing, where you can look at very targeted regions of the genome, maybe, a thousand bases at a time. You then move over to our high seqs, that came out, and these are instruments that are known as next generation sequencing instruments. Sometimes you hear them called second generation, or high throughput sequencing instruments These instruments really enable people to look at the whole genome, or very, very large targeted regions. The whole transcriptim, or the whole coding region, the whole exome, in an individual. And these produce tremendous amounts of data at a time. It was then realized that, although these are wonderful instruments for discovery based research. There are some people that are wanting to do more clinically relevant types of research and that is where the my seek comes in. The my seek is an instrument that produces a vast amount of data just like the singers, just like the high seek produces. But it's more targeted and enables you to look at very targeted regions of the genome and produce reports on those targeted regions. [SOUND] >> [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/0RHXK/sequencing","Sequencing","[MUSIC] This module is going to discuss sequencing technologies old and new. And focus primarily on the way in which new sequencing technologies are enabling a completely new way of approaching certain kinds of diseases and promise to open the way to personalized medicine. The discussion of any kind of DNA sequencing has to start with the idea of, how do you study DNA in the laboratory? DNA is a single molecule contained in each one of our cells, but how do you acquire enough DNA to work on to do a sequencing experiment or to do a SNP genotyping experiment? And that has been a challenge. And it was a challenge to the field until the early 1980s, when this man, Kerry Mullis, I invented the technology called polymerase chain reaction or PCR. Every lab that studies genetics in any way, shape, or form, has at least one and usually a lot more than one PCR machine in the corner. It's totally the workhorse. Doctor Mullis won a Nobel Prize because of this discovery. And as you can see, he can dress up to win the Nobel Prize or he can dress down to go surfing. Famously he likes surfing. So the idea behind the polymerase chain reaction is shown in the cartoons here. Basically, the first step is to take a large sequence of DNA, a small amount, the molecule, and denature it. There are a number of ways to denaturing it and basically that just means separating the two strands of DNA. And then the key is to create two short regions of the DNA that are complementary to the target region of the DNA that you want to study. And those are called PCR primers. So the next step is annealing the primers, gluing the primers to the individual single strands of DNA. And then there's an enzyme which will start at the primer site and elongate the DNA molecule using the single strand that you have as the template to create the double-stranded DNA. So now out of one double-stranded DNA molecule, you now have the beginnings of two double-stranded DNA molecules based on these individual PCR primers. You then re-denature, so you separate. Now you have four strands. You anneal PCR primers, but the PCR primers are different than the first one you used. You have a so-called reverse primer and a so-called forward primer. So in the second step, the elongation goes from the primer you've just annealed back to the site of the first primer. Now you have eight strands of DNA. You denature, and then you don't have to add more. You add both primers and then you go through the cycles over and over and over again. And the beauty of this technique is that after the fourth cycle you'll have 16 strands of DNA. The fifth cycle you'll have 32. The sixth cycle you'll have 64. Then 128, 256 and so on. It's an exponential growth. So out of a vanishingly small amount of DNA and two sets of PCR primers, you generate a very large amount of DNA that represents the region between the two primers that is amplified. And that's the fundamental basis of virtually all genetic technologies since the early 1980s. Even before there was PCR, people were trying to sequence DNA molecules and these are two scientists, Gilbert and Sanger. Sanger is the one with the tie, and Sanger famously won the Nobel prize twice. This is a picture of the two of them after they won the Nobel Prize for sequencing DNA. They had methodologies for sequencing the DNA. The Gilbert-Maxam method, the so called Gilbert-Maxam method, not widely used because it uses a lot of radioactivity and relatively toxic chemicals. The Sanger sequencing method, has been the mainstay of sequencing until the advent of newer technology. So the notion behind Sanger sequencing is the following. You take a piece of DNA, and you attach to that piece of DNA that has been denatured a single primer, a single region of DNA that is complimentary to the region that you're looking at. And that's called a single primary and you anneal it. And then you do the same thing as the PCR reaction, you amplify using an enzyme that elongates based on the initial template. And the trick here is that it elongates using nucleotides that you provide in the solution. So each time it sees a T it'll add an A on your strand. Then a C and it'll add a G. And it goes like that. But you've also added into the mix so-called dideoxynucleotides. And those are exactly the same as the A's, C's, T's and G's that I've talked about before, but every time one gets incorporated, that's the end of the elongation reaction. So when you put this into a test tube, a bunch of A, T, Cs and Gs, and then a bunch of dideoxy A, dideoxy T, dideoxy G and dideoxy C, you'll get strands of varying lengths. Just like is shown on this cartoon here. And each one is as long as it is until is terminates with one of those last dideoxynucleotides. Now the trick is that those dideoxies, they're detectable because they're fluorescent, and each one of them fluoresces at a different color. So you take this mix of elongated DNA molecules and you stick it into a chromatograph that separates them by size. So the longer ones don't migrate very far. The shorter ones migrate much better because they're short. And then you use detection methods to identify the specific color that each one of those fluoresces as a function of its length. You use a computer, obviously, to collect the data and analyze it. And the tracing on the bottom with the colors shows the kind of output that you get form this detector. And you can just look at that output and read, A, A, C, T, C, C, G, T, C, and that's Sanger sequencing. Sanger sequencing takes a couple of hours to do a couple hundred base pairs. And it obviously can be scaled up, but not scaled up much more than that. And has been the work horse for everything, for linkage studies, for any kind of study using DNA. Sanger sequencing and PCR together are the workhorses. So, all of you who are watching this will use personal computers or will use cellphones. And Gordon Moore, the founder of Intel famously invented something called Moore's law. And Moore's law says that the computational power in your computer doubles every 18 months. Here's a picture of Moore's law as applied to personal computing platforms in the 1990s and the 2000s. And it shows the increase in computation. Another way of stating Moore's law is that the cost of computing drops by a factor of two every year or so. So that's Moore's law famously. Now, that's a digression, of course, but how does that apply to genome science? Well, in the 1990s, there was a project called the Human Genome Project and the idea was a public, private partnership to sequence the human genome. And you can ask now that we've talked a lot about variation what is the human genome, but there were a small number of individuals who contributed DNA to this and it is their genome that was sequenced first. And of course, one of the things that allows us to do is to provide a template for thinking about how to sequence a lot more people. So the first human genome started to tell us a little bit about DNA is organized, where genes are? Where intergenic regions are? How many genes do we have? Those kinds of questions and provide the starting point for exploring genetic variation across literally millions of individuals. The genome project itself cost approximately $3 billion. Where that number comes from is hard to get, because obviously, it sort of depends on all genome science from Mendel on, but that's the number that is applied. And so the first human genome took about ten years to do using primitive mapping techniques, lots of tedious PCR and Sanger sequencing, basically, to get to the first human genome sequence. If the second one had been done immediately after the first one in the year 2000, 2001, 2002. They say, it would have cost around a hundred million dollars. The genome project was declared over in the year 2000 in a White House press conference, but the first human genome sequences were published in about 2002, 2003. The fact is to this day, there's not been a perfect sequence of the entire genome. There's still regions of the genome that are very, very difficult to read with older technologies or newer technologies. But clearly, we've made a huge amount of progress. Now if you apply Moore's law to the cost of getting a whole genome sequence, the way it would look is in the year 2013, 2014. I don't have data for 2014. But in the year 2013, the whole genome would cost about a million dollars to do and that's what Moore's law says, the cost drops by a factor of two every year or so. And in fact, for the first five years after the sequencing of the first human genome, that's about the way the cost of genotyping dropped, but then something amazing happened. New technology not Sanger sequencing based, but newer technology came along and the cost has now dropped to around $2,000 a genome. We're still not quite there for the thousand dollar genome and you see that the cost curve actually seems to have flattened out a little bit. That I think awaits newer technologies, which seem to be on the horizon that will really make it drop to a thousand dollars or well below and the question is what do you do with a thousand dollar genome? What are the things that you can do with cheap genomic sequencing like this that you couldn't do before? So the kinds of things that people are thinking about is to take families that have Mendelian diseases like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or not as well defined, but their come from very small families. You can't do linkage, is there way you can use this new technology to solve those cases? And the answer is yes, so you can solve cases where the phenotype is known. You can also solve cases where children have a very unusual phenotype, you think it must be genetic, the families aren't big enough to do any kind of classical investigation. And yet, genome sequencing provides an answer to that. So there are families that have been through many, many, many tests, the so-called diagnostic odyssey. Genome sequencing or sequencing pieces of the genome have been a solution for that. Identifying potential drug targets is another area, which I'll talk about in some of the cases defining the molecular subtypes of disease. And then finally, if we're ever going to start to use large scale genomic information in the flow of healthcare, it's probably going to be based initially on sequencing large amounts of DNA in each one of the patients who comes to the hospital. Whether we use all that information, how we all use that information is something that we're going to talk about toward the end of this course and represents a major challenge to genomic medicine. But the technology to be able to sequence, clearly is enabling for that kind of thinking. So, I want to walk you through one of the very first examples of how sequencing using newer technology enabled the development of an approach to Mendelian disease in very small families. This is an example that does not use whole genome sequencing. It rather uses sequencing in the region of the genome that encodes proteins. So remember, that's about 1% of the genome. If the entire genome is about three billion base pairs, the protein coding region, which we call. Remember, that's made up of exons, so people call it the exome. Exomes are around 50 million base pair. Still an amazing amount of sequence compared to what you would get with sequencing, for example. A couple of hundred based pairs at a time. And in this particular example, these investigators took four unrelated individuals with a known genetic disease. And they said, pretend these people walked in off the street. If we did exome sequencing, what would we find? And could we, in fact, infer the identity of the known disease gene from this. So they did exome sequencing in these four individuals. They also did it in about twelve other unrelated individuals and you can see that if you look at a single person In this study, but they have around 4,000 single nucleotide variances or single nucleotide polymorphisms across the exomes. So that's how many you have. Some of them are common. Some of them have been seen before. Some of them do not disrupt the coding region of the protein, the assumption in this particular case is the mutation when you find it will disrupt the coding region of a protein. And some of them have never been seen before and some of them are predicted by the computer to actually damage the function of the protein. So you can use a variety of filters to get from 4,500 down to a couple of hundred potential disease causing mutations in one individual. Now, that's a pretty huge exercise. And of course, in one individual, you're not going to solve the case by saying, well it's one of these 200 genes, go at it. But when they look at the second individual and then they looked at the third individual and they looked at the fourth individual. After four individuals, there's only one gene in which there's a specific set of mutations that are predicted to be deleterious, not found in any control populations and that turns out to be the disease gene for the disease that we're studying. So this is proof that you don't need that enormous family to solve a Mendelian disease, that was really interesting. So [COUGH] here's a Mendelian pedigree that I've shown you before. And if you just look at the male over on the left side, the number 10,000 below is sort of a guess of how many single nucleotides polymorphisms that person would have by exome sequencing. So if you just sequence that person you might say, that's 4,000 or 10,000 or some large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms, and one of those causes the disease. Now if you do the man and his aunt, the aunt, because she shares a quarter of the genetic material with her nephew, the aunt will have two and a half thousand, there'll be two and a half thousand variants that you have to study. And then if you can go down into the other family and look at the grand nephew on the other side, that person and the initial uncle will share only 300 variants. So even using exome sequence, if you can get a large family, you can get down to a small number of variants. This is without filtering for function or without filtering for anything else. You can get down to a small number of shared variants, and in the shared variants will be the variant that causes the disease if it's a Mendelian Disease. Here's another family. This is a family that was actually one of the first families where a new disease gene was discovered by exome sequencing. This is a complicated pedigree of the type I haven't shown before. It starts with the fifth generation or the first generation. The second generation has a son and a daughter. And then they have children, and notice there's intermarriage. So they're cousins that have married each other and second cousins that have married each other. In the last generation, there's a child who has the disease that's indicated in the black square and a child who died. So, in a pedigree like this, one way to explain the genetics is to say, well, because it seems to be in a family where there's lots of intermarriage, maybe there's lots of people in this family who carry one deleterious allele, one bad gene. But the disease itself will only manifest itself in someone who has two. And the likelihood of a child getting two is increased when the parents are related to each other. So on that assumption the child underwent exome sequencing. A single individual underwent exome sequencing, no more than that. Now, this is the way, so there's the pedigree again, just smaller. And this is the way exome sequencing actually works. I'm not going to walk through the gruesome details because they get pretty detailed. But the notion is in next generation sequencing and in these new technologies you get lots and lots and lots and lots of sequence data, but each one of the sequences that you get is short. It's 35 or 40 base pairs long. So when you have a 35 base pair fragment, the question is to which piece of the genome does that belong? What have I sequenced? So you develop computer methods to take that 35 base pair sequence and map it to a reference sequence. So you can see when this mapping exercise is undertaken, that each one of the 35 based pair fragments maps to the reference sequence perfectly, except in one place where there is a T instead of C. And that happens in every single one of these fragments. So this child has two copies of the gene, [COUGH] and both of them have T in it instead of a C. And this happens to be in the coding region, and it changes the encoded amino acid from a D to an N. And that single change is enough to account for this child's disease, which turns out to be a disease of intractable diarrhea. And the particular gene was an electrolyte transporter that's expressed in the gut. The bottom panels now show, number one, validation of the next generation result with plain old Sanger sequencing using the chromatograms that I've shown you before, and then comparisons of that sequence to other individuals and across species, and then a cartoon of where that particular variant would arise in the inferred protein structure. So the point of this exercise is to show that in a Mendelian disease, in a disease which in the olden days would have required exploration of the family and extensive linkage, all you had to do is sequence one individual and you could find the disease mutation. Now that's an unusual family, because there's intermarriage, and the assumption was made that you're looking for a variant that is present on both chromosomes. You're looking for some new homozygous variant. So that's one way in which that was solved. Another way is work that came from one of my colleagues, in fact. And he was studying two families in which children were born and, at birth, manifested a very serious electrocardiographic abnormality, which is shown below, and, more importantly, life-threatening abnormalities of heart rhythm. The parents are both completely normal. The parents are unrelated to each other. So the likelihood that this a child who is homozygous or carries two abnormal alleles is there, but the other possibility is that this child has developed a de novo mutation. Now each child I think I've said this, I know I've said this before, each one of use has about 100 de novo mutations, mutations that are not seen in either of our parents. And if they're unlucky, the de novo will arise in a gene which is important for some function. And then children can present at a very young age with a very serious problem. Yet these two families, both of them look like they could be de novos, so he went ahead and did exome sequencing in the two children. And this slide basically shows the filtering process that he went through again. Lots and lots of variants in the exomes. You've filtered down looking for ones that have never been seen before so they're rare ones that don't occur in the parents and ones that validate by Sanger sequencing. And when he does that he discovered a new disease gene for causing this particular terribly life-threatening problem in children. So a problem that was just unsoluble before the advent of next generation sequencing now lends itself to be solved within a couple of weeks of diagnosis using the next generation sequencing, which takes some time, and then the computational analysis, which also takes some time. And the final example that I want to show you, and it's one of many, many examples that we'll talk about in the case studies as well, is one of the very first studies that entertained the idea that we should sequence the DNA of a tumor. And ask the question, how different is the DNA of the tumor compared to the DNA, that the patient was born with. Now, I've talked about this before that there's this disease called chronic myelogenous leukemia and the marker for that disease is a translocation between two chromosomes that results in the so called Philadelphia chromosome. These investigators were studying acute myelogenous leukemia not chronic. And they asked the question, is there a difference in sequencing when you look at the tumor, look at the DNA that you get from leukemia cells versus DNA that you get from non-tumor, in this case skin cells. There are Venn diagrams on the top, and you see the Venn diagrams are labeled the top Venn diagrams are labeled Watson, Venter, and a number. The number is the patient, Watson is James Watson. One of the individuals who won the Nobel prize for discovering the DNA structure, and Craig Venter, one of the major participants in the human genome project. And the venter genomes and the Watson genomes were among the first genomes to be sequenced publicly and the data available publicly. So the Venn diagram on the top simply shows the overlap between the patients single nucleotide variants or single nucleotide polymorphisms and those with Venter and Watson. And you can see that each individual has many, many, many, many variants that are unique to them and many, many, many variants that they share. The bottom Venn diagram shows the overlap among those genomes and then the tumour genome. Now, this is too complicated to walk through, but the only point is to show that they discovered almost four million single nucleotide variants in the Leukemia genome. And then by filtering, asking questions like how many of those are in the germ line as opposed to the cancer genome. People use the term germline to refer to the patient's genome and tumor genome or somatic genome to refer to the acquired mutations in the tumor. How many of those are present only in the tumor? How many of those are likely to be functional? How many of those validate by sequencing. Because next generation sequencing is great but not perfect, and at the end of the day they came down to a list of eight variants that are present in the leukemia genome, not present in the genome, and may be drivers of the leukemic process. And this is in 2008. We're now five plus years later, and it's very clear that you can subset leukemia, using these kinds of approaches, and new drug targets are now being discovered and new drugs are being applied based on discovering what the genetic variability is in a tumor genome. And it's become quite clear that cancer is a disease of the genome. The mutations that arise in the cancer encode new proteins that have aberrant functions. Either driving exuberant cell duplication or failing to put the brakes on cell duplication that then result in the cancer process. So genome sequencing is having and will have huge impact on the way in which we manage cancer. So I've shown the picture of the cartoon before. The picture here shows one of the newer next, next, next generations sequencing devices. Not commercially available yet, but coming very, very soon. This is the device that plugs into your personal computer through a USB port. You put a drop of blood on it and an hour later have an entire human genome sequence. Now, the problem is we each have in our exome, five to ten thousand variants. In our genome, we have millions of variants and the question then becomes, which of those variants to pay attention to, which of those variants cause disease. And that is what people have called $1000 genome with $1 million informatics problem attached to it. And that's something we'll talk about through the cases as well as what we talk a little more later about how to apply genomic and other kinds of information to understanding disease, subsetting disease, and predicting drug responses.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/nEhkw/genome-wide-association","Genome-Wide Association","[MUSIC] This module deals with the topic of genome-wide association. Genome wide association is a technology or technique that has come along for genetic studies, within the last decade, less than a decade. It's been enabled by our understanding of how many snips we have across the genome. Hundreds of thousands, actually millions and technologies to actually assay genotypes at each one of those snip locations in large numbers of patients. I'm going to start this discussion with a quote from a famous cardiologist, actually one of the founders of American cardiology, named Paul Dudley White. In the 1950s and 60s, Paul Dudley White famously wrote that atherosceloris, the process of hardening of the arteries of the heart, seems to run in families and the mechanism whereby this happens was unknown to him. What I'm fond of saying is that the approach of genome-wide association studies one mechanism that we're using to solve Dr. White's problem. It starts with the idea of haplotypes, which I've introduced to you before. These are stretches of a genome from seven individuals and this stretch could be thousands and thousands of base pairs long and I've only highlighted the snips. The point of showing this is that, recall, that there are snips that are grouped together. If we have 30 million common snips, by common I mean the allele frequency is greater than 1% or greater than 5%. If we have 30 million of those across our genome, that's a lot of genotyping to do if we want to know the identity of the snip at each particular site. But it turns out that haplotype blocks of the type that are shown here make the problem a little bit more easy to address. Basically, in this particular example, we have a haplotype that is five snips together, and assaying any one of those snips tells us almost everything we need to know about the other four. There are now technologies, these are two chips that are from two of the major vendors, that allow you to do genotyping for a couple hundred dollars in an individual and that genotyping will get you a million snips, or five million snips. When I say get you, what I mean is it'll assign the genotype at each of those single nucleotide polymorphism locations across the genome, and then this is obviously a problem where quality control is really, really important. You have a huge amount of genetic data, and if you're going to analyze it, you better have quality control assurances in place because it's a garbage in, garbage out problem otherwise. Solving Dr. White's mystery, in this particular instance, involves not studying families but studying very, very large populations. Here's a very large population, and the first step in this genome-wide association approach is to phenotype the population. That is, we take each individual and we say, do they have the trait of interest or not? I might phenotype them this way, everybody in orange has what I want to study, and everyone in white doesn't. The orange people might be people who have atherosclerosis. They have a heart attack maybe before the age of 60. That's actually a common way of studying the atherosclerosis problem. Or women who get early breast cancer, or men who get prostate cancer, or patients who have abnormal heart rhythms, or patients who have abnormal responses to drugs. We'll talk about the kinds of phenotypes that people have used but they have used many, many kinds of phenotypes in this genome-wide association study experiment. That's the first step, precise phenotyping. Again, the quality has to be excellent. These are the kinds of phenotypes that people have studied. This is an example of what a person with a disease called macular degeneration sees. They see everything peripherally just fine but the center of their vision is very, very blurred. There's good data that this is a genetic disease. It travels in families but it only starts at age 70 or 80. Conventional approaches of linkage which I've talked about previously, didn't really yield a disease gene, or a disease locus in the genome when macular degeneration was studied. Here's an example of atrial fibrillation. This happens to be actually a family member of mine who has atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart rhythm. You can see that the rhythm is not regular, and again, you can phenotype people as having atrial fibrillation or not having atrial fibrillation. Those are the kinds of traits people have studied. They've also studied sillier traits. This is a picture of asparagus, and most people when they eat asparagus will notice a couple of hours later that their urine smells funny but there's a small group of people whose urine doesn't smell, if you ask them. I will cut to the chase, in this particular example. It turns out that all of everybody's urine smells after they eat asparagus but some people, on a genetic basis, lack the ability to detect that smell. They have a genetic variant in the receptor that detects that particular odor in their nose, and so that's why they don't smell asparagus. That's one of the applications of genome-wide association that I'm not sure has major medical benefit but it's interesting nevertheless. Then people have studied things like hair color or eye color. This is a picture of Prince Harry, who's famously red-headed, and there are genetic variants detected by genome-wide association that confer a greater chance than normal of having red hair. Those are the kinds of phenotypes that people have studied, and again, many, many phenotypes. Now you're Dr. White and you're trying to approach this problem. How do you do it? You take your patient population, phenotype them for early heart disease, yes or no. These studies involve large populations, probably starting with thousands and now in this particular example, going to tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of patients. At each of 500,000 or a million snip sites across the genome, you apply one of those genotyping chips that I talked about for a couple of hundred dollars and genotype everybody in the population for each snip. Now here's a snip site. If somebody has variant A, at that snip site, the likelihood that they're going to have the disease is very, very small. If they have variant B, the likelihood that they're going to have the disease looks like it's larger. I talked about statistical testing before, so you can assign a p value to this. The p value is very low, in this particular case, it's less than 10 to the minus 7th. That means p less than 0.0000001. So that's one snip site out of 500,000 and we've done now 500,000 tests. This is the way to display the data, there are 500,000 dots on this slide. The y-axis shows the location of the particular snip across the chromosomes. Again, notice that chromosome 1 is the largest, chromosome 2 is the next largest and chromosome 22 is the smallest of the autosomes. The snip locations are just displayed where they are in their particular chromosome across the genome. Then the p value associated with that particular test of association for that particular snip is shown on the y-axis. Where it says 7 on the y-axis, that means the p value is 10 to the minus Seventh, and it doesn't take a statistical genius to see two things. First of all that there are lots and lots and lots of P values that are less than 10 to the minus 4th or 10 to the minus 3rd, and that's the problem with multiple comparisons. You can't say P less than 0.05 because out of a million tests, 50,000 will be statistically significant if you use that kind of metric. So you have to set a much, much, much harsher threshold P-value for accepting what would be significant. And what people usually do in this experiment is a P value less than 10 to the minus 8th or so. And that's that little blue line that you can see very vaguely. It's actually 10 to the -7th in this particular plot. And it doesn't take a statistical genius also to see that there's a column of dots in chromosome 10 that have P values that are very, very low, 10 to the minus 12th, 10 to the minus 14th. Remember, the lower the P-value, the more statistically significant and the higher the dot is on this particular plot. So this is the way Genome-Wide Association Study data are displayed, and the conventional shorthand lingo is the GWAS, G-W-A-S. So, these are data that looked at what, not a trait that is yes or no, but a continuous trait. Continuous trait happened to be the duration of a particular interval on the electro cardiogram. And these are slides that I've, have borrowed from a friend of mine, and they studied this so-called QT interval. And what's interesting is this is the first result they had, and this was in 1,400 subjects. And you can say that there's a lot of junk on this slide. There are a lot of dots all over the place. It looks like there's something interesting going on on chromosome 1 though, doesn't it? There's a little column of dots that seems to go pretty high. So what they did was they added more subjects. And when they got to 2,500 that column on column one starts to get pretty interesting, and there are other columns that appear. Now, they're up to 8,000 subjects, and it's pretty clear there's a signal on chromosome 1. And there are other signals that look like they're getting to what we call genome wide significance. They're crawling above that little red line that's that threshold that we've set for ourselves. And now, with 15,000 subjects, it's very clear that there are multiple places in the genome where there are genetic variants that appear to influence this particular trait. So, the reason to show this series of slides is to make the point that we're looking at common variants in the genome. And the likelihood that common variants have very, very large effects sizes is pretty small. Most of these common variants will be associated, but they won't be associated with very high odds ratios or very high relative risks in general. These are very modest. So you need very, very large sample sizes to detect those risks. Here's another example of a study, in fact we were involved with many, many other people around the world. There were 100 authors on this study which is a very small study in the GWAS space. And this is comparing 12,000 cases of atrial fibrillation to 62,000 patients without atrial fibrillation, a common abnormal heart rhythm. And you can see that there are about ten places in the genome that creep up above genome wide significance. And there's one that has a P value that is 10 to the minus 80th or so, and it's indicated on this particular slide by the letter PITX2. And that's the name of the gene that's closest to that series of snips that's indicated by that column. This particular analysis didn't do the analysis quite the way I've described. It didn't take 12,000 cases and 62,000 controls. It took 1,000 cases from one place and 1,000 controls from the same place, and then 500 cases and 500 controls from a different place. And 750 pet cases and 750 controls and did this kind of GWAS analysis on each one of those smaller sets, and then combined them using a technique called meta-analysis. It's very common, and it's an interesting and pretty robust statistical way of acquiring the, and analyzing these very, very large cases. So meta-analysis is one way of acquiring a very, very large case series in the use of the GWAS technique. The relative risk for this particular, the snips that are the highest risk, the ones at chromosome 4 is about 1.6 per allele. So if you have the two alleles, your risk of developing atrial fibrillation is about threefold compared to normal. That sounds like a lot, but it's really not very much. And it's actually difficult to detect with any other way but studying tens of thousands of subjects using this GWAS approach. An interesting twist on displaying the data is shown here. So this is exactly the same plot, but now what I've done is I show you what is called a locus zoom plot. So take that region of chromosome 4. It's marked in the little red box and expand it. So remember, there are a 500,000 to 1 million dots on the parent graph here. And you can't see the individual dots, but when you expand the y-axis, you take it like this and you expand it. You start to see the individual dots, and you see the linkage signal. And you see there are those series of dots with a P value of 10 to the -60th or so, and there's other series of dots below that. And the little color coding on the side indicates the degree of linkage disequilibrium. So some of those snips mark the same haplotype block. And so there are basically two or three or four or five snips, but they are all telling you the same thing. They are telling you in this region of the genome, there is something interesting. And then there are other snips that also tell you in this region of the genome there's something interesting. But they're not marking quite the same haplotype blocks. So there's a sense from these data that there might be many different signals all in the same region that are all conferring risk, and it turns out in this particular case that's probably what's going on. The other thing that's interesting is that the names of the genes are displayed on the bottom. And although it says PITX2 on the parent graph, it's pretty obvious when you look at the expanded plot that these snips are between 50 and 100,000 base pairs away from PITX2. Actually if you look at the bottom, you can see that there are two genes indicated on that locus zoom plot, and most of the rest doesn't have a gene marked with it. That's a reflection of the fact that in fact across our genomes, most of the genetic material does not code for proteins. Only around 1% codes for proteins. The other 99%, people have called it junk DNA, but it's clearly not junk DNA. What it's job in life almost certainly is to regulate how much protein you make, where you make it. And you make it in response to which kinds of environmental or other kinds of stressors. So the notion here is that there's a region of the genome that is controlling expression of a gene, possibly PITX2, possibly some other gene, that is then mediating risk for atrial fibrillation. This is an example that I show because it breaks the rules. This is a GWAS that looked at a rare adverse drug effect, in this particular case, liver toxicity due to a new antibiotic. The antibiotic was called Flucloxacillin and actually never made it onto the market because of liver injury. And when they did the study, they had a very small number of cases. Not 12,000 cases, they had 51 cases of Flucloxacillin-induced liver injury. And a small number of population controls, 282 people who were just drawn from the general population. And it's very clear that there's an enormous single signal in the GWAS analysis. That signal is in a region of the genome at chromosome six that encodes a gene called HLA which mediates many immune reactions. And the odds ratio of this one is around 80. Now 80 is a pretty high odds ratio. And the question you might ask yourself if you were a patient is, I wonder if I have the risk variant? Because if I do, I don't think I want to take Flucloxacillin. If you're a patient and you ask yourself, I wonder if I have the risk variant for atrial fibrillation, it has an odds ratio of 1.6. And there's no medicine that I could take that would reduce that odds ratio in any significant way. This one might have a real clinical implication. But it's sort of the exception, rather than the rule. It's really unusual to see a huge signal on a GWAS analysis with this few patients. And almost the only place that happens is when you're studying unusual drug reactions. And we'll have more examples when we get to the cases. This is a slide that's very difficult to read. But I show it, and I show the links to it. The National Human Genome Research Institute keeps a catalogue of all GWAS studies that have been done since the first GWAS studies which were around 2005. So this is how new this technique is. And it falls into 17 different domains, which are very hard to read on this slide. But they include cardiovascular disease, cancer, immunologic disease, bowel disease, and then funny traits like smelling urine smell after asparagus or having red hair. And it just shows that there are many, many places across the entire genome where there are associations between common snips and these kinds of traits. And I've said those words correctly, because the association doesn't tell you much about the underlying biology. When GWAS came along, people had the great hope that here was going to be the technique that was going to tell us what gene causes atherosclerosis. What gene causes diabetes? What gene makes people people fat? What gene causes obesity? And it turns out that we can find places in the genome where there are snips associated with each one of those traits, but the challenge is to figure out what the underlying biology is. I can tell you that for almost all the common traits there are signals, and the more you look and the larger the populations, the more signals you see. So, for atherosclerosis, there are dozens of signals. For atrial fibrillation, there are around a dozen signals. And the question is, what are those signals doing? What's the underlying biology? And how can we use that to develop new drugs, new biomarkers, and new predictive tests? So this is an example from the very recent literature that I thought I would use to highlight. This is an example of a locus zoom plot for a GWAS that looked at obesity. And one of the signals that obesity has, that these GWAS for obesity have landed on over and over again is near the FTO gene. And you can see that there's a series of snips that are not in total linkage to this equilibrium. So it looks like there might be multiple signals within that region at the FTO gene. And the world spent several years trying to figure out what in heck this FTO gene actually does to mediate obesity. And it turns out that when you look in detail using more modern approaches to understanding gene function, that there are a series of snips in the FTO gene and another snip way on the side of this plot indicated by the arrow. And each one of those snips regulates expression not of FTO, but of IRX3, the gene right next door, tens of thousands of base pairs away from the GWAS signal. So the point is here that the GWAS just identifies a place in the genome to look. It's a signpost. Look here for underlying biology. It might be at the gene next door. It might be at the gene ten genes away. We don't know, but all we know is that there is underlying biology. So in summary, what GWAS does is identifies places in the genome where there's interesting biologic signals. And some of those signals would be impossible to find, the atrial fibrillation example, for instance. Whatever that signal is on chromosome four that we've written down as PITX2 would not be possible to find in any other way. What this experiment does for us is provide us new information about the basic mechanisms of disease that allow us to pursue new drugs, new biomarkers, and new ways of approaching individual patients. It's not the closest gene. The technique requires very large numbers of subjects. And in general, once a result is obtained, the next step is to find another population and repeat the experiment to make sure that the result stays there. That's the gold standard statistical way of approaching a GWAS. You really have to have replication. Ancestry is incredibly important. There are some snips that are common in some ancestries, not common in others. The likelihood is that the disease processes are going to be the same, but the snips that predict those disease processes might be quite different across ancestries. It's of course, a huge multiple comparisons problem, so you have to do statistics to fix that problem. And then here is another example where you have to make sure that the cases and controls really are comparable for everything except the trait that you're studying. So if you're studying patients with atrial fibrillation, you better make sure that the only thing different about the cases and controls is that one group has atrial fibrillation and one group doesn't. The medications, the underlying diseases, the ancestries, the ages, the genders, all those things should be comparable. If they are not, there are statistical ways of correcting for them. But they all weaken the experiment if they're not really comparable. The genotyping data of high quality is another question that you should always ask yourself. There are standard ways of making sure that there's quality control in a genotyping experiment, but it's an enormous amount of data. And so those pipelines have to be pretty robust. GWAS, so what can it be used for? The great hope was going to be, well we'll find the gene for diabetes. And then we'll develop a test to predict who gets diabetes. And we'll develop a drug that inhibits the function of that gene, and that's the end of that. Now it turns out that that great hope has not been met. But there was certainly hype in the public media. You couldn't open, for a while, a newspaper without reading, gene for diabetes, gene for breast cancer discovered. Well, that's not quite what was happening. What was happening is GWAS signals were being identified. But these are ways of identifying heritability of a trait. You could take all those 500,000 or a million snips and establish how heritable a particular trait is. You can identify new drug targets. You can use these data, we think, to predict risk, but it's going to be more complicated than just one snip at a time. We hope that we'll be able to use these kinds of approaches to subclassify disease. So a patient might be labeled today as having a disease called rheumatoid arthritis. But some patients respond to certain drugs. Some people respond to other drugs. Are there ways of using genetic information derived from GWAS or other approaches to subclassify disease? And then of course, to understand and maybe prevent adverse drug effects, is another thing that we hope this technique will be good for. So let me just close by highlighting the difference between what goes on in a GWAS and what goes on in a family study. The family studies are looking for variants in the genome that have very large effect sizes, but are very rare. The so-called Mendelian diseases, sickle cell disease, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or diseases like that. The GWAS approach looks at very large populations, looks specifically at common variants. And asks the question, are there common variants that affect the susceptibility to the trait? And those common variants will have very small effect sizes, almost by definition. Remember if they had large effect sizes, if there was some variant that was very common in the population that conferred early severe diabetes, well over generations that variant would die out. So the idea is that these variants are common and therefore unlikely to have very, very large adverse effect sizes. And the real question for modern genetics which we're beginning to tackle is what goes on in the middle. What is it about combinations of rare variants and common variants that confers susceptibility to disease? How do variants interact with each other? What's the underlying biology? So, the technology to interrogate the genome has been a huge boon to literally thousands of human traits. And we're only beginning this journey into understanding the relationship between the genome and human disease and drug responses. [SOUND] >> [APPLAUSE]",""

And the people we see in that clinic are patients and families who have heart diseases that run in their families, that are inherited from generation to generation. And so, in our clinic, in addition to just caring for the patients, taking care of their symptoms, we are often able to identify specific gene mutations that are causing the disease. And once we find that mutation we can screen unaffected family members to see if they carry the mutation that predisposes them to the condition. So clinically available screens are good, they detect the mutation approximately 50 to 75% of the time in our clinic. The problem is that leaves a significant number of patients and families where the mutation can't be identified. And so screening and risk-stratifying those families become significantly harder. So one experiment that we did involved one such family where a mutation couldn't be found. And so this family, there were about 200 family members. There were over 40 affected individuals, and when they were screened using clinical technologies there was no pathologic mutation identifed. We were able to take affected members of this family and, using whole exome sequencing, identify the pathologic mutation on a research protocol. And then, once that was identified, to take that information back to the family and perform clinical screening. So in that way, we were able to take a clinical problem to the lab, make a genetic discovery and then bring that discovery back to the bedside to actually care for the family.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/V4HU8/finding-disease-associated-genes-linkage","Finding Disease-Associated Genes: Linkage","[MUSIC] In this module I'm going to talk a little bit about how we approach finding diseased genes in families that have unusual diseases like the familial forms that I've talked about before. So here is a family, I think I showed this particular family tree before and this family has a pattern of inheritance that goes across generations. Each affected individual is shown in red, and you can see that the pattern is that women transmit to men, men transmit to women. And there's approximately equal numbers of men and women affected that in each generation an affected person transmits to approximately 50% of their offspring. So this is a family tree that I did show before and I wanted to highlight the idea that in generations three there's nobody marked as having the phenotype that we're interested in. And the reason for that is many of these diseases will have what's called variable penetrants. So there has to be somebody in that family, and it has to be this person, in fact that's shown in red now who is an obligate mutation carrier. That doesn't mean they have the disease. But we know that if the grandfather has it, and it is genetic, and it's transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, which is what this pattern looks like. Then that person in generation three, the mother of the two affected children in generation four must be a carrier. So an important step in starting to resolve these particular patterns is to make sure that we understand the phenotype and understand the family relationships because otherwise it's a garbage in, garbage out problem. And if we analyze on the wrong assumptions well, we'll get to the wrong place. So the question that an investigator would have when they're faced with large kindred like that. Where they're reasonably certain that it's a genetic disease, is where in the genome is the variant or perhaps the set of variants but hopefully the single variant causes the disease, how do you find that? Well it turns out there are places in the genome that are variable, and they're variable in a random relatively random way across individuals and those places in the genome allow us to do what's called mapping. So one kind of variant that's very, very common is a single nucleotide polymorphism or a snip. Another kind of variant that I haven't talked about much before is what's called a repeat variant. So here is, here are two separate genetic sequences and one person has four TA repeats and the other one has two TA repeats. That's called a dinucleotide repeat because it's a pattern of two. And here is a person who has four Trinucleotide repeats TAC, TAC, TAC, TAC, and the other one is only TACTAC. So, that's two copies or four copies. And there are ways that are pretty simple To distinguish between people with two copies or four copies of these repeats or ten copies or 17 copies. Most of these repeats will not be in the coding region, and in fact, if a dinucleotide or a trinucleotide repeat were in the coding region, it would almost certainly disrupt the amino acid sequence and have profound functional changes. So here is a small family. And these are representations of a chromosomal sequence in the mother and the father in this family. So the chromosomal sequence in the mother is shown in pink and green and in the father in pink. And then there's a little block at the top that's yellow and a little block in the middle that is blue. Those blocks represent individual haplotype blocks that have arisen over time, and make different sequences in mom and dad. Each one of those are mappable using dinucleotide or trinucleotide repeat patterns across the genome that allow people to distinguish those alleles. Now what happens here is that one daughter, it has a pattern that is actually interesting, it's not like mom or dad. It's sort of the top half is like mom, and the bottom half is like dad. The one son inherits that particular region of this particular chromosome from dad. The infected son inherits it from Dad, and the uninfected son inherits the maternal chromosome. So when you look at this pattern and you start to think about which patterns track across generations. You think, well maybe it's something in that blue region that confers disease. Everybody who has the blue region has the disease. Everybody who has not the blue region does not have the disease. That's why the phenotyping is so important, deciding who is a carrier and who is not. And then having large, large multigeneration families because that allows more recombination events to take place and more genetic mapping to occur. And how do you find that blue region? Uses the dinucleotide or trinucleotide repeats currently it uses snips and as I'll talk about in a couple of modules, there are much newer ways that have actually superseded these kinds of approaches which many people would regard as relatively primitive, but of huge historical importance. So, the way in which the statistics are done in these kinds of families is there's logarithm of the odds ratio score, the lod score. And a lod score greater than three, And there's a way of defining that statistic. Suggest that you have landed in the right region for this particular genetic variant. Now it doesn't tell you what the genetic variant is, the region might be huge, it might encompass dozens and dozens of genes, and the challenge to the investigator is to either get the region smaller by acquiring More recombination events, in other words, more generations. Or by tediously tracking through the particular region of linkage to find the gene that actually causes the disease. A Lod score less than two suggests that the region that you've been looking does not have the disease locus contained. And in between, you just need to do more. So I'm going to show you one example Of how this technology was used to crack a common, a relatively common disease that's inherited in an autosomal fashion, what's so called Mendelian disease. This is a very, very large kindred. You can see With affected individuals shown in dark, many of the individuals are dead because it's a large family. And the disease might kill them early, but in fact, age will kill many of them. So you have to have phenotypes. You have to have DNA on large, large numbers of patients, and do mapping. This particular phenotype happens to be a family, a French Canadian family in fact with a disease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that results in a thickened ventricle. This exercise in mapping initially would cover perhaps several hundred dinucleotide repeat regions across the genome. Mapping those would identify a region of the genome in which the disease gene would occur. So you can imagine with mapping 400 markers, you would arrive at a very very large chunk of the genome. In which the disease gene occur. So that was what was done. First this a small region of chromosome 14 in that particular family. And you can see there's a Lod score that is very, very high in this particular region of linkage. So, with that particular marker, it's likely that the disease chain the actual mutation that causes the disease is located in that region. But that region spans hundreds of thousands of base pairs. So with advancing technologies and the ability to define those regions in more detail, and to define the genes in those regions. Came the ability to actually isolate the specific gene and the specific mutation that causes the disease in that family and the way to do that is to have a large family with a high Lod score and some physiologic rationale. This is a map of the disease genes called the beta-myosin heavy chain gene. It's a gene that's expressed in the heart as an important part of the contractile apparatus. This gene was identified as a disease gene in the disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 19 89. To this day it's not very clear how a mutation is beta myacin heavy chain results in the phenotype of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Nevertheless, the discovery has been a huge boon to clinicians because we can now use genetic testing to identify mutation carriers and non-mutation carriers. This is a cartoon from the very first publication that identified the mutation in this particularly family, but we now know that there are literally hundreds of mutations in this particular gene that cause the disease in other families. And there are literally dozens of genes in which mutations can cause the disease not just in betamyosin heavy chain, but in other genes. And the interesting thing about those genes is that they all encode proteins that interact in some way with the beta myosin heavy chain gene to effect the way the heart contracts. So it's a great story of going from a family, doing traditional linkage, finding the region, finding the gene and then using that information to uncover the cause of the disease in many many other families. And start to understand the underlying path of physiology, start to develop genetic testing, which we talk about more in the case studies. And I emphasize again, the reason that that was successful is that it starts with this very very large Family. Very small families, individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are just simply not informative using this linkage approach. But what the good news is is that with newer sequencing technologies which I'll talk about in a couple of modules. We can actually crack cases of patients who have unusual phenotypes and don't have much of a family history and we'll talk about that later. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/O4Jq8/ancestry-genetic-variation-across-generations-and-geography","Ancestry: Genetic Variation Across Generations and Geography","[MUSIC] This module we'll talk about genetic variation across generations and across geography. The issue of genetic ancestry, and how that affects the way we think about genetic testing, and how that interferes with our ability to do genetic testing across the globe. It doesn't interfere with our ability, but it creates an interesting problem and an interesting issue, because genetic variants that are common in one population are not common in other populations for reasons that I'm going to try to explain here. So the fundamental concept is illustrated by this slide and this subsequent ones. This is a stretch of DNA, it could be a coding stretch, it could be a non coding stretch. And I have highlighted the areas where there are SNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms, known. This is a single copy of DNA, but remember, there are going to be two copies in every individual. And here are two parents, so the maternal allele is in green, the paternal version is in red, and they both have two copies. The places in the reference genome are in black, and the places where there are SNPs for each of these four chromosomes, actually three of them have SNPs on them, are indicated in red. So you can see, and this might be a stretch of several thousand nucleotides, but I've only highlighted the SNPs. So, these two parents will come together, and generate a child. And the child will have one chromosome from one parent, and one chromosome from the other. So, in this particular stretch of DNA they will have one version from mom and one version from dad. Now sometimes the child's genetic makeup is different from that predicted by this simple scheme for a couple of reasons. One is that every time we generate a new individual across the three billion base pairs of DNA, there's a chance for a mutation to arise by chance. We call that a denovo mutation. That's Latin for new mutation. So, in this particular example, this child has in this stretch of DNA, acquired a new mutation at the G position. Turns out, denovo mutations are pretty uncommon, but each of us as individuals, has about hundred denovo mutations. And about one of those hundred is in the coding region of the genome, the region of the genome that encodes for proteins, as we've talked about before. So children's DNA varies from their parents because they each get a chromosome from one parent. They also can have denovo mutations and they have recombination events. That happens across generations, so over generations you look less and less like you might predict from simple predictions than your great, great, great, great great, great grandparents. You still have, you share the vast majority of your DNA but you'll be a little bit different with each generation. So here's a stretch of DNA that has, again I've highlighted the SNPs, and this could be a stretch of several thousand DNA nucleotides. And here's another stretch of DNA in a different individual, same stretch. And you'll notice that there's five SNPs in a row that are different from the reference sequence on top. And I've highlighted the reference sequence in blue, and the sequence on the bottom is in red. And if you look at many, many, many individuals you'll see that sometimes people have the red stretch and sometimes people have the blue stretch. So that's very important because what that says is that there's a series of SNPs, but they're not independent of each other. They travel together, and that's what we call a haplotype. Now for this particular example, on the top strand, every time you have a C in the first position, you know that you have a C in the second position, a T in the third position, a G in the fourth position, and the T in a fifth position. A C in the first position predicts perfectly what the other four SNPs are going to be. And the same for the sequence in red. The A at the first position predicts perfectly what the others are. But occasionally, that prediction is not perfect. There I've highlighted the example at the bottom here where the prediction is almost good, but not quite. So it turns that there are regions of the genome where there are many SNPs together, many common SNPs together, and they all predict each other's occurrence. We call that linkage disequilibrium, and a simple way of showing that, this is a very simple linkage to this equilibrium plot using a program called HaploView, so there are five SNPs shown here. Labeled one through five, and they have a number code on top which is not very important. And their physical presence across a region of DNA is shown on the top. So the four are very close to each other, the fifth is some distance away. And for this little block, the denser the color of red, the more likely it is that one SNP travels with another SNP. So we call that a haplotype block, and you can see there's a region of great linkage to this equilibrium in the middle of this region where there are three SNPs, numbers two, three, and four, where the predicted value of one to tell you what the SNP is at the other site is way over 95%. So that's a haplotype block, that's a very, very simple plot. Here's a much more complicated plot, this happens to be work from our own lab. There are four rows, the rows are African Americans, European Americans, Hun Chinese, and Hispanic subjects. And the five, their six genes, regions from six genes shown across the top and the names of the genes are not very important. They're very important to me because they happen to have influences on heart rhythm, which is one of the things I study. But for this example it's not very important. You can see the gene called KCNH2, has lots and lots of red, especially in the European Americans, the Hun Chinese and the Hispanic. That means there's a high degree of linkage to this equilibrium, and doing a couple of SNP tests in one or two places in that gene might tell you a lot about other SNPs across that gene. The KCNQ1 gene next to it on the other hand, has very little of those red blocks. So there's not much linkage disequilibrium, and if you want to know about SNPs across that particular gene, you're going to have to do a lot more genotyping. The other thing to notice here, which we're going to talk about in a moment, is that in general there's much less red, there's much less linkage disequilibrium in the African American population than there is in the other populations, and there's a reason for that, and that's because we all come out of Africa. So this slide illustrates the idea of a bottleneck. Here is a group of marbles in a bottle, or perhaps variants across a population. And then something happens to their culture, to their geography, and a small group of them go somewhere else. So the bottleneck you can think of is people migrating out of Africa, or you can think of it as marbles falling out of the bottle, but you can see that in the little cup on the side, there's only blue balls and white balls, there's no more yellow balls. So the yellow variant, whatever that was, is not going to be present in the population that survives the bottleneck. I hope that makes sense because its very important for animals. It turns out that all the cheetahs in the world [COUGH] are descended from one or two great, great, great, great, great, grand parents. They have a lot of genetic material in common. There was an ancestral cheetah that had lot more genetic diversity, now they don't. And there's great concern that would die out because that they don't have a lot of genetic diversity, which could protect them against certain kinds of diseases or certain kinds of predators. So the idea is that there were migrations of populations initially out of Africa. So there are large groups of subjects in Africa who were not part of these migrations, and they have incredible genetic diversity because they're the most ancient of populations, and they have been creating migrations for themselves within Africa. But there's a group that goes off to Europe and then a group that migrates off to the far east, and then as you know across the barring straight, and into the Americas. And then down into Austral-Asia, the time course is shown on this map. And we can use genetic markers to say, this population looks more like this population, and they have ancestral genes. Some of them have an ancestral genes from one group of people, and some of them don't have ancestral genes. Now remember we're acquiring mutations as this process goes on. So 200,000 years ago, 200,000 Kya, there is a group of variants in genomes, and those are ancestral genomes. They're very ancient and as populations migrate across the world those variants, particularly if they're common, will be preserved across many, many populations. So we'll see those kind of variants in different populations, but as populations migrate and as denovo mutations happen, and as people marry, or intermarry with other populations, you start to acquire new variants across a population. So that the, you can measure how new a population is, and when the populations diverged from each other by looking at common genetic markers across the genome. So, here is an example, these are Y chromosome genetic variation pattern. These are, each color is a different set of haplotypes from the Y chromosome, remember the Y chromosome comes from in males. It's only in males, and it comes from the boy's father's, father's, father's, father's, father's, father's, father's, father's, father's. It's the paternal lineage. You can see that there's one particular pattern of haplotypes that we see in Africa. And then as populations migrate, the pink pattern emerges in Europe, the orange pattern emerges in the far east, and the red pattern emerges in North America. So that reflects the fact that as populations were migrating, they were acquiring new mutations. And we can see what those mutations are, and what the common patterns of genetic variation are across the world. That, of course, is important for when we start to study diseases that are related to the Y chromosome, and this happens on every chromosome, of course, because if we think there's a common genetic variant that, for example confers susceptibility to malaria, or a common genetic variant that confers susceptibility to heart disease, or a common variant that confers immunity to getting HIV infection, that might be particular to a specific population. So this is the iceberg concept, if you have a huge population, lots and lots of penguins and they're red, and white, and green, and all of the different colors, but its a very large population, the iceberg breaks in half, you'll still have a lot of genetic diversity in the remaining half. But if you have a little population, and a small group of penguins carve themselves off from that little population, then it's entirely possible you'll lose some of the genetic variation. You'll end up with a population that has only a couple of genetic variants, and when that population goes off to some new island, they'll lack certain variants that were there in the parent population, and as they acquire new mutations, they will acquire a new kind of genetic identity for themselves. So small populations tend to create new genetic populations, we call that a founder population. There are many, many examples of founder populations. On Tangier Island, which is in the Chesapeake Bay, there is a very high incidence of an unusual disease, strangely called Tangier disease. Tangier disease is a very interesting disease that has to do with the way cholesterol is transported in the body. The patients have a high incidence of heart disease, and they have strangely orange tonsils. And it turns out there's a very specific genetic variant that causes this disease. And that variant was brought to Tangier Island by the initial settlers. The initial settlers start to intermarry with each other, and that particular variant, which is incredibly rare across the population, turns out to be very common in Tangier Island. A little group of penguins have created a group of patients who have a particular disease. Seals in the North Atlantic have the same problem. Seals have many different colors, many different skin colors, and a many different body habitus. If it turns out that a predator likes a particular kind of seal, or a disease happens to attack a particular kind of seal, the remaining population will then be enriched in other kinds of seals. So you can see that the starting population has many, many different coat colors. The ending population only has white and brown coats. So that is an example of an environmental influence of some kind that is enriching the population in a different way. We think that there's genes that will do the same kind of thing. This is a pretty classic example when you look at the incidents of the sickle cell trait, whichI've talked about it a little bit and we will talk about it some more. It's very, very high in certain areas of Africa, and it's those areas of Africa where the incidence of malaria is the highest. So the idea is having the trait, having one abnormal gene, does not confer the sickle cell disease, which is bad, but it does confer protection against malaria. So in this way genetics and the environment interact with each other to enrich the populations that we see over generations. And this is the final example that I want to show you. It is possible now with more advanced sequencing technologies, which I'll talk about it in a little while, to actually acquire large collections of common single nucleotide polymorphisms across many, many different populations. So I've talked about how Africans are different from people in the far east, or from Europe, or from people in North America, the native North American Indian population. But here's an example where these investigators looked at large numbers of subjects in specific areas in Europe. And they asked the question, can I distinguish an Englishman from a Serbian, or Spaniard from a Pol, based on common genetic variance. The way they analyze the data, and the way they display the data is something that I don't want to get into. But basically the axis are indices of north south and east west genetic variation across the continent of Europe. And what is extremely interesting, or extremely fascinating to me, is that the genetic map, which is all those dots in the middle, reflects the geographic map which is shown in the inset. So the group of red and blue dots down at the corner are come from Spain and Portugal. And the group of dots in green, at the other extreme, come from Russia and Poland. So in this way, the map of Europe genetically looks like the map of Europe geographically. That's because until very, very recently, once populations established themselves in a particular locale, they tended to marry to each other, not much interbreeding. And so the genetic variants tend to become distinguishable geographically over time. That becomes important because there may be diseases, they may be drug responses, to which specific populations are very high risk, or at very low risk. Understanding the genetic determinants of that may mean that you have to study specific populations, and more importantly, we really are becoming very, very sensitive to the idea that a good genetic experiment has to take into account ancestry, measured globally. Are you a European or an African? Or measured very, very locally, are you a Spaniard, or a Portuguese, or Greek? [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/FLkUE/family-history-and-inheritance-patterns","Family History and Inheritance Patterns","[MUSIC] This module will discuss various patterns of inheritance of what we call Mendelian diseases. The diseases that we use the name Mendelian to honor Gregor Mendel, the monk who did his pea experiments and described the rules of inheritance for these kinds of diseases. The diseases that are rare and that run in families. One fabulous example of an inherited disease is shown by the British Royal Family. This is a family tree of Queen Victoria, the elderly woman in the picture. And she's shown with her favorite daughter, Princess Beatrice, who is way over on this side of the family tree, married to the Prince of Battenberg. Now, Queen Victoria, herself, was healthy, and Princess Beatrix was healthy. But you'll notice that many members of her family, and they're all males, indicated by the male symbol, have a disease. And we'll come back what that disease was in a moment, and how it is that this particular disease effected multiple members of the royal family. Most famously the, Prince Nicoli who died at the age of 14. He didn't die of hemophilia, he died because he was shot in 1917. Interestingly Queen Victoria has another disease in her family. On this family tree she's shown at the bottom. At Queen Victoria, you can see on the bottom, and several generations up is King George III. Mad King George III. Who is thought to have a disease called porphyria, another genetic disease. And Porphyria, one of the characteristics is that people don't think straight. They get mad, they get crazy. And it's thought that during one of his episodes of madness, he managed to give away the United States and allow the United States to become independent of Great Britain. It's a geneticist's view of history. So, one of the key features of creating an understanding of these diseases that run in families that run across generations that are relatively rare is to construct the family tree. And so a family tree might be constructed this way, the squares are male, the circles are females. And their very symbols that can be inserted into those a male and female symbols to indicate for example who is affected and who's not affected. Who is alive, who is dead. Who has a mild disease, who has a severe disease. So you can see that each one of these family trees start with the a set of parents, four children, two of them marry, each one of them has two children. Those children then in turn have between three and four children each. So that's a family tree. And here's a pattern of inheritance, which is pretty typical of one of these relatively rare diseases. An affected parent, several affected children. Each child that's affected has the chance of having an affected child themselves. So the rules in this particular family tree are that males can transmit the disease to females across generations. Females can transmit the disease to males across generations. Both sexes are affected in approximately equal numbers. Approximately half of the offspring of an affected person has the disease. So this is a disease, this is a pattern that we call autosomal dominant. Autosomal means that it's transmitted in one of the 22 autosomes, not the sex chromosomes. And dominant means that a single copy of an abnormal gene will transmit the disease. So this is the way it looks in a reduced family tree. The affected parent has a chromosome that carries an affected gene. I've colored the chromosome in red. But remember, the chromosome has thousands of genes and only one of those genes is abnormal. It might be abnormal at a single nucleotide, but I've colored it in red just to indicate the one that carries the abnormality. The grey ones are normal. So when the egg and the sperm from this set of parents come together to generate a new fertilized egg that will generate a child, they can do it in one of two ways. They can generate an abnormal chromosome from the mother and a normal chromosome from the father, resulting in a child that has the genetic abnormality. Or they can do it in a way that the normal chromosome from the mother and the normal chromosome from the father come together to generate a child who does carry the genetic abnormality. So in this way you can see that there are four possibilities, and they're shown here. So about 50% of the offspring, on average, because this is a chance event each time a fertilized egg is generated. On average, half of the children will develop will carry the abnormality and may develop the disease. So we often abbreviate this as B would be the the normal gene, and little b in red would be the abnormal gene. So we can go back to the large family tree now and assign what we call a genotype to each one of the family members. So there are a couple of important features here. First again, females transmit to males, males transmit to females. About 50% of the offspring of a carrier individual are also carriers. There are no individuals who are offspring of normal individuals who carry the disease. So everybody on that side of the family tree, the descendant of the mother who is not a carrier, none of those individuals have the disease. Occasionally, and actually it turns out far more than occasionally, you'll get a situation like this, in which the family tree looks just about the same as before, but now there's one person who doesn't seem to have the disease. I've colored everybody in red who has the disease. That person does not have the disease. That can arise from a number of different mechanisms that we'll talk about those in subsequent modules but that's called variable penetrance. That means that not every single person who has the genetic abnormality will necessarily get the disease. And of course it complicates interpretation of a family tree like this, because you have to scratch your head an say, well what would happen if. Now that we have genetic testing, we can actually establish that this person is actually a gene carrier, a mutation carrier, and transmitted the disease. This person, in this family, if we know what the disease is we would say this mother is an obligate mutation carrier. She has to carry the mutation in order for her children to have developed the disease that her father had. Here are two examples of diseases that are transmitted in autosomal dominant fashion. I've mentioned both of these before. The familial example, the familial hypercholesterolemia, where a single genetic abnormality, often in the LDL receptor is sufficient to result in very, very high concentrations of LDL cholesterol. In the extreme form a person will actually have more than one abnormality that results in the extreme extreme form of familial hypercholesterolemia. Those are children who will get heart attacks when they're 10 years old. That's extremely unusual, but it's quite common to see people with LDL cholesterol levels that are very, very high and make them susceptible to early heart attacks. Marfan syndrome is the other example, again, a single base pair change in the DNA is sufficient to alter the structure and function of the fibrillin protein to result in this particular disease, which again can be lethal because of the aortic root problem. But here's another inheritance pattern and it doesn't look like autosomal dominant does it? Because the only infected individuals on this family tree are males. So the problem here is that this is what's called a sex link disease and it's transmitted on the sex chromosomes. The abnormality is actually on the X chromosome. And the X chromosome carries an abnormality that results in disruption of the function of a particular gene that's carried on the X chromosome. Now, the mother does not have the disease because she has a normal copy of the X chromosome. The father in this particular family tree doesn't have the disease because he has a normal X chromosome. But when they generate fertilized eggs, sometimes the mother will donate her abnormal X chromosome, the father will donate his normal Y chromosome. That generates a male child who does not have any normal X chromosome, and therefore will get the disease. The other possibility is that you generate a carrier child by transmitting the abnormal X chromosome, and the normal X from the mother, and the normal X chromosome from the father. So again, there are four different ways in which these combinations can arise on average. And on average, one of those, the male children will be 50/50 affected. The female children, half of them will not be carriers, and half of them will be carriers. And this, of course, is the problem in this particular family tree. Queen Victoria and her daughter were carriers of the hemophilia mutation. So they don't have the disease, but they transmit the disease hemophilia across generations to their male offspring. And that's a well recognized X linked disease. Here's another example, and in this example, this is sort of an extreme example, the pattern looks like it might be autosomal dominant. But look at the first generation, everybody is affected, and then all of the mothers transmit to their sons and daughters. All the daughters transmit to all of their children, but the sons never transmit. So this is not a problem of the X chromosome. This is not a problem of an autosome. This is a problem of the mitochondrial DNA. The piece of DNA that is exclusive to the mothers. So the mother transmits her mitochondrial DNA to each of her children. The males of course don't transmit their mitochondrial DNA because the mitochondrial DNA that their children get come from their wives, come from the female parent. So, this is a pattern that looks like it's mitochondrial inheritance. And here's the final pattern that I want to talk about, and this is an isolated individual who comes from two separate family trees. You can see that there are two separate family trees. The parents are unrelated in this particular case. So, the problem here is that each parent carries an abnormal gene, but the presence of a single abnormal gene is insufficient to produce a disease. So they don't know, they look normal, they feel normal, and they, in fact, generally look pretty close to normal. Although with sophisticated testing, sometimes we can detect subtle abnormalities in the parents. But one time in four, the parents will manage to transmit an abnormal gene from both mom and dad to the child. So the child now has two abnormal genes and disrupted function of that whatever protein it is that, that gene encodes and that in turn results in a disease. 50% of the offspring are carriers and so they can transmit the subsequent generations if they mate with someone who's also a carrier. And then one child in four does not inherit the mutation. The problem here is interesting because the chances of this happening depend on two individuals coming together to generate a child which has two abnormalities. The chances of that happening are increased when the parents are related to each other. So if families share genetic material, then the chances of cousins or second cousins generating this kind of inheritance pattern is greater than two random individuals. So for this to happen, either the parents are related or the carrier state is extremely common across the population. So the two diseases that are the hallmarks of this particular inheritance pattern, which is called autosomal recessive. Meaning, you have to have two copies of the abnormal gene to generated a cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. 1 in 30 white people of Northern European extraction carry the cystic fibrosis a cystic fibrosis mutation. When we do the math, that means 1 in 30 fathers and 1 in 30 mothers. The chances of those finding each other and mating by chance, or 1 in 900, and 1 in 4 of those matings will result in a child with cystic fibrosis. That's 1 in 3600. So 1 in 3600 is pretty common, but it belies the fact that this carrier state is extremely common, 1 in 30. And the same holds true or African populations where the sickle cell trait is 1 in 25 or 1 in 30. Again, resulting in a high burden of sickle cell disease, but that reflects a very high burden of carrying the sickle cell trait. And of course, remember we talked about Mendel. And Mendel's original observation in the peas was that smooth peas and wrinkled peas appear at a ratio of 3:1. And the mechanism is exactly the same. The wrinkled pea characteristic is recessive. That pea plant has to inherit an abnormal gene from mom and an abnormal gene from Dad. And among those three normal pea plants, two of them are what we call heterozygous. They carry one admirable gene and they carry one normal gene, and one of them is homozygous for the normal gene function. So, the problem that we run into in contemporary genetics, is two fold. One of them is these Mendelian diseases. Sickle cell disease. Cystic fibrosis. Many heart diseases. Many forms of abnormalities that are transmitted from parents to children. But increasingly we're recognizing that there are families in which certain kinds of diseases run, and we're confused sometimes about the way in which these are inherited. Part of the confusion arises because of this problem of variable penetrates that I discussed before. That not every single person who carries an abnormality of the gene, a mutation, will not necessarily develop the disease. So, here's a problem for the physician in the office. The woman in red comes to you and says, my father just died of stomach cancer. Should I be concerned that I am going to have stomach cancer? The usual answer might have been, well, why would you even think that? You're paranoid. But in the 21st century, we have to start to think about conditions that run across families which may be harder to recognize. So a clever physician might take a family history. A family history here might include for example an aunt who has uterine cancer. Well, you sort of say, well uterine cancer and stomach cancer those are two kinds of cancers, maybe they're related, maybe not. And then you start to look at the other rest of the family. And the grandfather has polyps in his colon, but he doesn't have cancer. Is that a syndrome or not? Well it turns out this kind of collection of diseases is very typical for a disease called Lynch syndrome, which is known to be genetic and has many different manifestations. Colon polyps, uterine cancer, stomach cancer. So this woman is correct to be concerned, and there's actually now testing available to see whether she has Lynch syndrome and therefore needs to extra supervision in her life to see whether she's developing certain forms of cancer. The same kind of thing might happen in this family. This man comes to you and says, my father died of a heart attack when he was 42, should I be concerned? You take the family history, there's a stroke, there's a leg amputation, and you start to put it together and that signifies severe disease of the arteries of the body. Not just the heart but of the brain and of the legs. And that, in turn, suggests that this person might have a disease like familial hypercholesterolemia anemia and suggests certain kinds of genetic or other testing they should have. So I think one of the areas in personalized medicine that we're going to have to start focusing on, is getting family histories right. And that in fact, requires engagement of families. A family has to be able to look back at their own relatives, to ask their own relatives, what is it that grandaddy died of? What is it that his father died of? And construct these family trees. And so that's going to be an important component of medicine going forward. Not just for Mendelian diseases, but diseases like this which turn out to be quite common and run in families. And the genetics will tell us something about risk and may tell us something about treatment. There are tools. This is one that's on the web available from the US Surgeon General that allow families to start to construct their own family trees. And I think that's going to an increasing part of a medical practice as we move into a era. The power of empowering yourself by knowing what your family history is. [SOUND] >> [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/XB09a/drug-metabolism-and-variable-drug-responses-four-more-examples","Drug Metabolism and Variable Drug Responses  Four More Examples","[MUSIC] So, this is the last in a series of modules that have illustrated the problem of high risk pharmacokinetics both in terms of pro drugs as well as drugs with narrow therapeutic indexes and one pathway for metabolism. There's a problem of genetics in those pathways, there's a problem of drug interactions in those pathways. And in this particular module we're going to run through them. When I say run through, we're going to go through quite quickly four different examples of different drugs in different therapeutic areas that have the same kind of story. I don't want to spend all of our modules going over each individual drug because we have other things to talk about in the broad space of personalized medicine. So, I'm going to do this by presenting you four cases and I'm going to read the cases as I do them. So, here are the four cases. We'll come to the next ones in a second. The first case is a six year old girl being treated for ALL who develops profound bone marrow suppression and life threatening infection. It turns out the drug that is the culprit in this particular story is 6-Mercaptopurine which is part of the regiment for all children with ALL, 6MP is metabolized by HPRT to an intermediate called TIMP. Lots of lots of initials in there but I'd rather do the initials than the full names. And then through an enzyme called thiopurine methyl transferase or TPMT, is bio-inactivated. From the TIMP intermediate, you can either go through the TPMT pathway or you can go up to 6-thioguanines. 6-thioguanines are the stuff of which the anti-cancer effect of 6-mercaptopurine is generated. So, you want to generate the 6-thioguanines, but too much 6-thioguanines will turn off the bone marrow. There's also an alternate 6-MP pathway which goes directly from 6-MP down to 6-methyl-mercaptopurine, shown in the middle of this slide. So, it turns out there are variations in the TPMT gene. This set of variations were actually discovered in the early 1980's. The commonest of the variant alleles and none of these are very common is the so called *3A allele which is actually two, separate snips that are in linkage to this equilibrium, both of them non synonymous as shown on this cartoon at the top. And if you look at population frequencies, the population frequency for the *1/*1 is high, the population frequency for the intermediate metabolizers is relatively low. And the *3A/*3A homozygous where the ones who have no TPMT activity is a very, very, very small set of subjects, probably something like one in 300. So, one in 300 children exposed to 6-mercaptopurine will fail to generate TPMT activity, and therefore all the 6-MP shunts to 6-thioguanines and they have dramatically increased anti-cancer effect and it also dramatically increased side effects. So, in cartoon form, this is what it looks like. If you give everyone the same dose without thinking about the genetics, the systemic exposure, that's the 6-thioguanines, is highest in the *3A/*3A and lowest in the wild type, the *1/*1. And the frequency of toxicity is a function of time is shown in the middle panel, or in the right hand panel. Very little toxicity in the extensive metabolizers, a lot of toxicity in the poor metabolizers, but there are very few of them. Imagine a situation where in fact what you do is you dosage us. You know the genetics, and so you reduce the dosage in the *3A/*3A, and in fact you think, maybe you should increase the dose a little bit in the *1/*1s, because they're the ones that need more anti-cancer effect because they're shunting away from the 6-thioguanines. That way the systemic exposure is roughly the same and the incidents of toxicity will be reduced. That's the hope and there are some studies that show that that's actually what happens. You can certainly avoid the severe bone marrow toxicity this way. And the argument is one in 300, is that worth doing? Some places do it as a routine, some places don't. Another drug that follows exactly the same pathway as Azathioprine, widely used in controlled immunologic diseases from inflammatory bowel disease to a number of settings and liver disease for example. Azathioprine is actually hydrolyzed to 6-mercaptopurine and follows the same path way. So, physicians who use Azathioprine is a matter of course have a choice of not monitoring at all, monitoring by assessing 6-thioguanine plasma concentrations and that's done, or knowing up front which patients to be most worried about by knowing the TPMT genetics, and that's part of the story. Now, of course it's a little more complicated, but by now you're used to getting a little more complicated because there is another metabolic pathway for 6MP, and that's through an enzyme called xanthine oxidase to 6-thiouric acid. And the problem there is that xanthine oxidase is an inhibitable by allopurinol. Allopurinol, a pretty commonly used drug in some cancer chemotherapy settings, so not unusual to get allopurinol in these kinds of patients. Allopurinol a potent inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, and again, you eliminate that pathway of 6-mercaptopurine elimination, you increase the likelihood that things flow through the 6-thioguanine pathway, and therefore cause toxicity. So, a complicated pathway, with multiple implications for genetics as well as for monitoring plasma concentrations of the 6-thioguanines and for these two important drugs. Another story is a 57 year old man being treated for metastatic colon cancer with a drug called irinotecan develops severe diarrhea. So again we need to know a little bit about irinotecan disposition here. Irinotecan is a pro drug. It's bio-activated by carboxyesterases to a compound called SN-38 that is active and in the liver SN-38 is eliminated, not by metabolism, but by conjugation by glucuronides by an enzyme called UGT 1A1. So UGT1A1 is one of the so called phase two enzymes, and in fact it's the largest part of that phase two pie that I showed you in one of the earlier lectures. It turns out there are the variants in the promoter region of UGT1A1, the common variant is the so called 6TA repeat variant. The variant is the 7TA repeat variant if you count the number of TAs there's six on the top one and seven on the bottom. And so, it turns out that individuals with six repeats, have normal UGT1A1 expression. Individuals with seven repeats, have markedly reduced UGT1A1 expression. Of course, just to make things complicated, this is called UGT1A1*28, and individuals who are homozygous for the *28 have less UGT1A1. Now, interestingly, one of the things that UGT1A1 metabolizes normally, in all of us, is bilirubin. Bilirubin gets conjugated to glucuronide, and that's well known. And so individuals who have the UGT1A1*28 allele tend to have higher bilirubin levels because they don't conjugate as efficiently and that's know as Gilbert's syndrome. Some small number of normal medical students, I always ask the medical students, see whether anybody has Gilbert's syndrome, some years somebody sticks their heads up and other years two people, other years no people. So, it's relatively common and it's manifest as mild hyperbilirubinemia, often getting worse with things like fever. But, that's not the problem with irinotecan. The problem is that irinotecan undergoes, or SN-38 undergoes bio-inactiviation by UGT1A1. So, if you don't have UGT1A1 you'll have much more toxicity, so much higher SN-38 concentrations and drug toxicity as a consequence. So again, some people advocate UGT1A1 genetic testing prior to using your irinotecan and other people say well if they get severe diarrhea I guess they were a UGT1A1*28 carrier and let me try something else. So, here's another story. A 35 year old African American with a kidney transplant has persistently low concentrations of the anti rejection drug tacrolimus. So, the problem here is in an enzyme called CYP3A5. CYP3A5 is a member of the CYP3A superfamily, the commonest one is CYP3A4. CYP3A5 has been known for a long time, and the common wisdom, the conventional wisdom is that CYP3A5 activity is absent in most individuals. Of course, what we really mean by that is absent in most Caucasian individuals, because those are the ones who were participants in the first studies. There's a snip, an intronic snip, in the CYP3A5. I've shown here a cartoon of the genomic structure of CYP3A5. There are 13 exons and there's a snip in intron 3 that's indicated by the arrow. Now, if you have a variant, you then create an alternative splicing event and insert an extra exon out of that intron. So people with the variant have 14 exons, people without the variant have 13 exons. When that messenger RNA gets process into protein, the message it creates either *3 or *1. *3 is a message that results in a non functional protein. *1 is a message that results in a functional protein. Most Caucasians are *3. *1 is expressed, *3 is not. These are data again from our own center showing the ancestry dependence of the *1 or *3 expression as a function and its relationship to tacrolimus concentration. So, what I'm showing you here is something called the principal components analysis. The details are not all that important but what you can do is analyze large scale genomic data and get a sense of what ancestry it is the subjects are coming from. The big cloud on the right of this is a cloud of mostly Caucasians. The smaller cloud on the left of this plot illustrates where African American subjects are. So, you can look at this plot and readily distinguish Caucasians from African Americans and that becomes important in our study. Because if we're going to say African Americans do this or Caucasians do that, we need to be able to define who they are. We can define that by asking them or we can define that by genetic criteria like on this slide here. And when we looked at 446 kidney transplant patients, tacrolimus concentrations were strongly associated with the *3 allele. And what's really interesting is the *3 allele is present in 92% of European Americans, but only 30% of African Americans. So, what that means is that African Americans have CYP3A5 activity, European Americans do not, in general. So, if you're a subject who's taking a drug that's a CYP3A5 substrate, like tacrolimus, and you're African American, your concentrations will be lower. Now, there are two ways to manage that. One is to know the genetics and to adjust the dose appropriately. The other is measure plasma concentrations. In either case, something has to be done to adjust the dose to make sure that patients don't reject their precious kidney transplants. And so this is a mechanism for ancestry dependent variability in plasma concentrations and response to an important drug in the therapeutic armamentarium of physicians caring for patients with kidney transplants. So, the last case is actually not a genetic case, but is important conceptionally, so, I really think it's important to put it in here. An 82 year old women on chronic sotalol therapy develops renal failure, marked QT interval prolongation. And perhaps it arrhythmias of the type that I've spoken about before. So, I showed you this slide in one of the earlier talks and it illustrates the idea of pre-systemic drug metabolism. A drug as absorbed, it can be metabolized in the intestine. The metabolite and the drug go off to the liver, where further drug metabolism and perhaps excretion into the bile occur. Then this drug and its metabolite reach the systemic circulation, where it's eliminated through the kidneys with its metabolite. Now, Sotalol is a little different. Sotalol does not undergo metabolism. So, the cartoon is even easier because there's no metabolites contaminating this cartoon. Basically all the sotalol that you ever take goes through the portal circulation, gets into the systemic circulation and is excreted in the urine as an unchanged drug. And we don't know the processes exactly, there may be transporters involved, but this is the way it works. So, in a patient who develops renal failure, this is what happens. There's less excretion and much more drug in the systemic circulation, and when that happens, toxicity with QT interval prolongation and perhaps arrhythmias of the type I talked to you about can occur. So, this is conceptually important and the reason that it's conceptually important is shown on this slide. So, this is a summary of the problem of high-risk pharmacokinetics. We can have drugs that are either pro-drugs on the left, or parent drug that is bio-inactivated, and we can have the situation in which they're rapid metabolizers indicated by the red arrows and we get excess drug effect in that case. Codeine and clopidogrel are examples of that with different enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. So, the other problem is the problem of inhibition of those pathways. So, the pathways can be inhibited by genetic polymorphisms, they can be inhibited by interactions as I've shown you before. And now the sotalol example is exactly the same thing but it's the parent drug on the right being excreted by a single pathway, in this case, the excretion is through the kidneys. There's no metabolism involved, but when that excretory pathway fails, parent drug accumulates and you get toxicity. So, not only does that apply to drug metabolism, it applies to excretion of unchanged drug and the multiple examples that are shown. Here are examples that I've talked about in previous modules where variability and these kinds of processes lead to variability in effect and sometimes really severe adverse drug effect. So, that's the story around high-risk pharmacokinetics, with multiple, multiple examples. And each time we use a drug that is known to be an inhibitor of a pathway, we have to think about whether we're going to alter the affect of a drug in a patient that we're taking care of. Each time we start a new drug that has this problem of single pathway disposition, we have to think about whether we're going to run into trouble this way. The other problem is that a number of the drugs that I've talked about in the past couple of modules have other ways of being monitored, and there's an argument that says, well, why should I pay attention to the genetics? Why don't I just pay attention to for example the INR with warfarin or platelet function testing with clopidogrel? Or 6-thioguanines concentrations with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine or drug concentrations with tacrolimus? And I accept those arguments and my contention is that those are important parts of monitoring patients if they're validated and very helpful at managing them. The genetic information doesn't change. So, I think the genetic information, if it's going to contribute to the way in which we manage patients, is best used at the beginning of therapy when you actually have a handle on what it is this patient might do or might not do based on the genetics that you have in hand. Then you can start to drag it an appropriate dose and monitor them using those complementary monitoring techniques that are shown on the right hand column. So, the major teaching point at the end of these several modules is that high-risk pharmacokinetics are a problem. There are ways around that for a number of drugs, including genetic monitoring, complementary monitoring methods and the question then is, how good is the evidence that you have the genetics affects the outcome? Do you have alternate therapies for people with variant genetics? And what are the outcomes when you deploy those alternate therapies? Some cases we have great data. In other cases we have less great data. [APPLAUSE]",""

In this example of genotyping, we're looking at variations in Cyp2d6 gene. This particular variation is a splicing defect. You can see in this screen, the individuals who are in the green area have two normal chromosomes. The individuals showing up in the blue area have one chromosome with a splicing defect and one normal chromosome. In this example of genotyping, we're looking at the v-course c1 gene, this is a single nucleotide polymorphism. These are the rare double A individuals, these individuals have 1A and 1 gene on each of their 2 chromosomes, and these 12 individuals all have Gs on both of their 2 chromosomes. These are genotyping results from the SLCO1B1 gene. This gene has an impact on statins. These individuals are homozygous for the A allele. These individuals are heterozygous and have one A allele and one G allele. And these individuals have two copies of the G allele. So after the genotyping is complete and the quality control work is done, the file would be transferred to analysts. They would be comparing information on individual's metabolism of the different drugs, if they're poor metabolizers, rapid metabolizers, ultra metabolizers, and then what their genetic status is. And through research, people were able to find those connections, those associations, which then were tested in the clinical setting. [MUSIC] [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/oKgCp/a-bleeding-complication-5-days-after-starting-warfarin","A Bleeding Complication 5 Days After Starting Warfarin","[MUSIC] This module continues our exploration of the sources of variability after administration of a drug, looking at the genetics in particular. And the example for today is a bleeding complication after starting Warfarin. As you'll see, Warfarin is a drug where there's a complication because there's more than one gene that plays an important role in variability in its action. So, the case is a 76 year old woman who is noted at examination to have incidental atrial fibrillation. She's started on a standard dose of Warfarin, five milligrams a day. Has other medications, none of which are very likely to interact with Warfarin or cause problems. Five days later she presents with severe back pain, and the question is what should you be worried about? Now, in an elderly patient there's all kinds of things you could worry about, including a compression fracture. But having just started Warfarin, one of the things you should be aware of is that there's a potential for hemorrhage, and in this particular case, a retroperitoneal hemorrhage. This is a CT scan of the abdomen in a patient, who has a very large retroperitoneal hemorrhage, as shown by the arrows. So, why does this happen to some individuals relatively early during Warfarin therapy? Now, Warfarin is a drug that has a relatively narrow therapeutic index, and what I wanna do on this slide is to illustrate to you what I mean by a narrow therapeutic index. Two dose response groups are shown here. One shows the cumulative incidents of a therapeutic action as a function of increasing dose or plasma concentration on the x axis, and the cumulative incidence on the y axis. That's in blue. And the other curve shows the incidence of adverse events as a function of increasing dose or concentration. You can see these curves are widely separated, that the drug that we're interested in here, has a high likelihood of producing a therapeutic effect. And actually not all patients get adverse events even when you push the concentrations as high as you'd like them to. This is a drug that has a very, very wide therapeutic index. Here's an example of a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, the curves are much closer together. Everybody gets side effects if you increase the dose high and not everyone will get a therapeutic action. And what's most important is at concentrations, or at doses that produce efficacy in some patients there will be adverse events in others. So, that's a drug with a narrow therapeutic window, or a narrow therapeutic index and Warfarin is an excellent example of that. Little too much drug, adverse event. Little too little drug, no therapeutic effect. So, it turns out that bleeding, or complications due to blood thinning drugs, Warfarin, Clopidogrel, and aspirin, are the commonest causes for admission to hospital. This is a list of admissions to hospital in two general hospitals in Great Britain. The most common category of drugs that provoke admission, are non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs. They include aspirin in that group. The second most common are diuretics. Many, many diuretics producing adverse events. But Warfarin stands by itself as a drug, alone in third place, and when you add up the Clopidogrel complications, and the aspirin complications, bleeding due to the these drugs, is one of the commonest cause of admission to hospital because of side effects. So, it becomes important to understand mechanisms underlying variability in response to any anti-coagulant drug that we use. Warfarin it turns out, is administered as that is it's an equal part of S-wafarin and R-warfarin. S-warfarin is the active in R-warfarin is less active. It's not devoid of activity, but it's less active. S-warfarin undergoes bioinactivation through metabolism at the seven hydroxy position and the enzyme that accomplishes that bioinactivation is cyp2c9. So, another player in the Cytochrome P450, or CYP super family. There are two functionally important and common snips in the CYP2C9 gene. Both of them are non synonymous. They change in amino acid and they change function. The *2 Allele is relatively common. 12% minor Allele frequency in Caucasians. And it has reduced function. The star 3 Allele, a little less common, 5%, but it's a loss of function Allele. So, here is a study from the late 1990s that was one of the first to explore the relationship between variation in a CYP, CYP2C9 in this case, and outcome of treatment with a drug that was a CYP2C9 substrate Warfarin. So, the first panel that I'm showing you shows the frequency of different genotypes in patients who are receiving normal doses, 5 mg a day, or so is a normal dose, and patients in whom the dose was adjusted downwards because of monitoring the INR, which is the standard way of adjusting Warfarin dose. So, and patients who end up on a maintenance dose of Warfarin that is less than 3 mg a day, the frequency of varying Alleles, *2, *2, *2, *3, *2, *1, *3, *3, is much higher than in the reference population where most patients are *1 ,*1. Some of them are heterozygous, and very few are homozygotes or compound heterozygotes. That's one observation. The other observation, which is really interesting and actually has not yet been perfectly explained. Is that patients who ended up on less than 3 mg a day tended to have more bleeding events. It's as though they were on 3 mg a day, but some days they would need 2 mg a day or some days they would need 4 mg a day. That's what we think is going on, but whatever the reason, patients who end up on a lower dose of Warfarin tend to have a higher incidents of bleeding long term. And that maybe because of the genetics or because of factors that have not yet been clearly understood. So, if you were to draw a pathway for Warfarin disposition at the beginning of the 21st century, this is what it would look like. You would say S-warfarin, the active metabolized by CYP2C9 and are warfarin less active metabolized by something else to produce inactive metabolites. Now in 2004, investigators in Germany looked at a family, or a series of families with an unusual pharmocogentic trait and that is complete absence of response to Warfarin. What these families have is you can give them hundreds of milligrams of Warfarin and nothing happens to their INR. And they discovered that mutations in a gene they call V-K-O-R-C-1 or VKORC1, are the cause of Warfarin resistance. And it turns out that Warfarin, a drug that has been used since the 1950s as anti-coagulant and parathentically as a rat poison, it's pharmaceutical target, the protein with which it interacts to produce its effects, was actually unknown until this study came out. It turns out the protein encoded by VKORC1, which is also called VKORC1, is in fact the protein with which Warfarin interacts to effect vitamin K synthesis, and that's how Warfarin acts as an anti-coagulant. There are variations in the promoter region of the VKORC1 gene. That's the region that controls how much VKORC1 the liver makes. And there are variations that are classified by haplotype. This is a simple example haplotype A and haplotype B. You can see there are sequences across the nucleotide sequence as shown here that are different, [COUGH] but they attract together. Haplotype A is associated with much less liver production messenger RNA for VKORC1 and haplotype B. So the prediction would be that, that would result in less protein. And therefore, patients who carry haplotype A would require less warfarin for inhibition of vitamin K dependent synthesis of clotting factors. So if you draw the pathway now, you would draw it this way, but VKORC1 modulates the cycling of vitamin K and the fashion shown on this slide and there are two major genes that effect warfarin response, CYP2CP and VKORC1. VKORC1, the variants are not in the coding region, except in those rare patients who have the warfarin resistances trait, but they are in the promoter region. So that's the trait and then there are multiple other genes that control different enzymes that are responsible for cycling. I'm not gonna talk very much about them, I'll just point out that one on the left called CYP4F2 that's responsible for vitamin K metabolism itself and we'll come back to that one in a second for a second. One of the things that people who administer warfarin around the world have known for a long time is that different ancestries require different maintenance doses of warfarin. So the idea is your start warfarin you measure the RNR over time and you adjust the dose for the RNR's between two and three and everybody ends up on a different, stable warfarin dose. Caucasians, the average dose is five milligrams a day, average. Some people need less, some people. Among African subjects, it's about six milligrams and among Asian subjects, it's about three or four milligrams. Those don't sound like big differences, but of course, a little bit of overdose with warfarin and you will have a bleeding complication like the patient I presented initially. And too little and you'll have a thrombosis complication, because of failure of drug efficacy. We at Vanderbilt along with many, many other investigators around the world were part of something called International Warfarin Pharmocogenomics Consortium that investigated the genetic basis for variability of warfarin response and one of the the first studies we did was to look at the relationship of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes and steady state dose. So, it turns that the genotypes vary by ethnicity and the VKORC1 genotype that predicts a lower dose requirement is much more common in Asian subjects than it is in African subjects. They're labeled as AA and AG here and not haplotype A and haplotype B, but the AA is the haplotype A that I show you on the previous slide. The GG is the haplotype B. You can see that the frequency of those star two and star three alleles are much higher in the European population than they are in the Asian or the African populations, we'll come back to that in a moment. So one of the things that the Warfarim Pharmacogenomics Consortium did is showed in this slide and it's a little complicated, so let me walk you through it. The idea is that you can use clinical factors that are known to affect warfarin concentration. Clinical factors such as age, sex, presence of interacting drugs, such as certain statins or amiodarone and predict what the study state warfarin dose is. That's called a clinical dosing algorithm. You can use a clinical dosing algorithm along with the genetic information that you know to create a pharmacogenetic dosing algorithm or you can use what's called a fixed does algorithm. So what we did is a simulation, basically, consortium that we said. Suppose we compare those three approaches to prescribing morphine does, how do well do they do in a very large population of subjects in whom we know what the dose should be? So among patients who end up needing five milligrams a day, a fixed dose regimen of five milligrams a day is perfect. Would that we knew that those patients would need five milligrams a day, but that's perfect and the clinical algorithms and the pharmacogenetic algorithms perform just as well. The y-axis on this slide shows the proportion of subjects that are close to their predicted dose by the algorithm. So as long as you're in the middle, as long as you're average five milligrams a day is just fine. Now it turns out that there is 20 to 30% of the population that's below average, it turns out and 20 to 30% that are above average. So in those patients, five milligrams a day is not gonna cut it, because they will never be close to the actual steady state dose. The clinical algorithms do pretty well, that's the blue bars and the pharmacogenetic algorithms at the extremes. Do a little bit better than the clinical algorithms. So this is becomes important when I talk about the randomized clinical trials looking at warfarin dosing. So genetics seems to add a little bit. Not surprisingly, it adds a little bit of the extremes. It doesn't help in the average subject and if you knew your subject was average, you wouldn't need genetics. But of course, we don't need it until we have it and we know that the subjects are average or not. People have done GWAS's looking at the relationship between common genetic variance and steady state warfarin dose. This is a GWAS in a large group of Caucasian subjects. The top panel shows the raw results and shows that there's a very strong signal at or near the CYP2C9 locus, not surprisingly and at the VKORC1 locus, not surprising either. If you condition the analysis, you do the statistics and say, let me make CYP2C9 and VKORC1 at covariant, and see if there's any other signals. The other signal that emerges is shown on the bottom side and that's the CYP4F2 variant. So it turns out that there is a variation in that CYP. [COUGH] So it turns out that there is a variation that CYP that is responsible for vitamin K metabolism itself that contributes to variability in warfarin dose, but not to the extent that CYP2C9 and VKORC1 do. Now the other problem is that of ancestry. So, I showed this slide before and I showed you the incidents or the frequency of the star two and star three oils is much higher in European populations than it is in African populations or Asian populations. The table at the bottom shows you the oil frequencies across Europeans and Africans at our own hospital when we look not only at star two and star three, but a couple of other variants that are known to be common in African subjects, star 6, star 8 and star11. And of course, it turns out that those are hardly detectable at all in European populations but quite prevalent In the African population. So any algorithm, any approach that we're gonna use to try to personalize warfarin care has to take into account the fact that there are variant alleles that are ancestry specific. There aren't the Caucasians and Asian subjects tend to look the same in this regard. The star two and the star three are the ones that are frequent in Asian populations, but they're obviously as you can see not as frequent in Europeans. We've gone on to do a genome wide association study as part of the International Warfarin Consortium in African american subjects and this is the raw result and that signal that you see is VKORC1 signal not a surprise, it should be there. So again, you do the statistics and say that's the covariant. Let me see if there are other statistic signals and there is a signal. That signal's pretty close to CYP2C9, but it's not CYP2C9. We don't know what that signal is, it's real and it's not a variant that predicts outcome in other subjects in subjects of other ancestries. So this is an approach using genome-wide association to To uncover the mechanism whereby certain ancestries have different dose requirements for this commonly used anticoagulant. The other problem with Warfarin is that there are occasional patients who take Warfarin and don't have much of a therapeutic response at normal doses. This is a slide showing the relationship between Warfarin plasma concentration and Warfarin effect in a group of subjects who received very high doses of Warfarin, generally without much anticoagulant affect untill high doses were achieved. Now the most common explanation, not surprisingly is that the patient's were probably not taking the drug, so their plasma concentrations were quite low. But there are patients who take the drug. Their concentrations are within the therapeutic range. Those are the triangles at the top of the graph, and yet their anticoagulant effect is pretty minimal. So these are patients with rare non-synonymous variance in VKORC1. These are patients who have sort of a variant on the Warfarin resistance syndrome that originally identified VKORC1, but they obviously have a response. They don't have total lack of response to Warfarin, but they have a coded region variant that makes them less likely to respond to Warfarin. So you would say, well, if I have a patient who needs ten or 12 milligrams a day. That's an unusually high dose, and I guess they have one of these. But, if you run an anti-coagulation clinic, you have to be aware of the ancestry of your subjects. So, there's one of the variants here is D36Y in VKORC1. D36Y is rare, except In subjects of Ashkenazi origin, and there the allele is quite frequent. It's about 5% of the population. So if I ran an anti coagulant clinic in an area where most of my patients where Ashkenazi Jews, I think I would insist on genotyping this particular variant of VKORC1 as part of my ability to predict dose requirement or not. But in other populations I don't have to worry about that. I might have to worry about other rare variants. So the last part of the Warfarin story is shown here, and I'm just gonna talk at this slide rather than explain much of what it is. This slide basically shows that there were three large trials that examined [COUGH] the influence of using pharmacogenetics to guide Warfarin therapy during initiation of treatment. Each of the trials were designed a little bit differently. The nuances might or might not be important but the idea was pick either a clinical algorithm or a pharmaco genetic algorithm. In one study, they picked a fixed dose algorithm versus a pharmaco genetic algorithm, and then randomly assigned patients to be managed through one algorithm or another and then asked the question how many days, over the course of the first 30 days, or 90 days of therapy, were patients in the therapeutic range for their anti-coagulation? And the answer is, that genetics contributed very, very, little to getting people into the therapeutic range. So one argument is the genetics, while they appear to contribute mightily To the overall dose of warfarin, studies using GWAS and other approaches have estimated that 40 to 50% of the variability in Warfarin dose requirement is genetic. That genetics doesn't translate into time and therapeutic range over the course of the first month or three months of therapy. The other argument is that asking the question about time and therapeutic range over a month or three months is the wrong question. What we really want to know, are there subjects that are gonna bleed early or subjects who are gonna take two or three weeks to get anti coagulated? And there's not enough bleeding episodes in any of these trials to answer the question of bleeding susceptibility, so that's left open. But right now the position of genetics with respect to Warfarin is a little bit uncertain. There's no question there's a huge genetic effect, but how that translates into clinical medicine is not so clear. Of course, the other part that affects Warfarin dosing is that there's a whole series of new oral anticoagulant drugs that are available, which in large randomized clinical trials appear to do as well as Warfarin, sometimes better, sometimes equivalent. And the argument is, well Warfarin is a difficult to use drug. You have to do all this dosing adjustment. You have to think about the genetics. The newer anticoagulants, a single dose fits all. My own bias is that it's unlikely that the new drugs must be really good, because if you could dose adjust the new drugs because they are anti-coagulants with a narrow therapeutic range, you could dose adjust them somehow they would do even better. So the fact that a fixed dose of a new drug beats dose adjusted Warfarin in general suggests that these drugs really are very, very effective, but they're new, and again, expensive. In certain situations, Warfarin is still the drug of choice, and we don't actually know what the long, long term outcomes with these medicines may be. So stayed tuned. But Warfarin, if nothing else, has been a great example of a drug whose complicated pharmacogenetics involving not variation in one gene but common variation in two genes effects mightily the last dose, the final steady state dose the people end up taking, and may effect response. So again just to summarize one more time. Warfarin is an example of a single pathway to drug elimination. In this case, CYP2C9 with the extra added feature that it also has variability of its target. And so drugs that inhibit CYP2C9, there are a couple or genetic variants that decrease CYP2C9 activity will result in increased Warfarin effect. [MUSIC] [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/0yoyg/respiratory-arrest-after-tonsillectomy","Respiratory Arrest After Tonsillectomy","[MUSIC] This module continues theme of high risk pharmacogenetics and focuses on a case of an unexpected adverse event after tonsillectomy. A 12-year-old undergoes uneventful tonsillectomy and is given codeine for pain control. They're found unresponsive at home and brought to the emergency room where they're given naloxone, the opioid antagonist and the sensorium clears. So what are the possible explanations? Well again, this is not a problem of non-compliance. This could be a problem of too much drug, clearly. It could also be a problem of a drug interaction and it may be a problem that has a genetic story. So let me tell you a little bit about coding and why it is that the FDA no longer recommends that we use coding in patients who are getting tonsillectomy and other kinds of simple kind of pain control situations. Codeine is a pro drug, just like clopidogrel. It undergoes bioactivation and its bioactivation is accomplished by CYP2D6. And the active metabolize is a compound that many of us are familiar with, morphine. So when you give codeine, you expect the patients will generate morphine and receive pain relief. Poor metabolizers predictably have less morphine generation and, in fact, less pain relief. And we know that. But that's not the problem here, is it? The problem seems to be too much of a drug effect rather than too little of a drug effect. So let's come back to this graph for a second and notice that the distribution among extensive metabolizers Is pretty broad. There's some extensive metabolizers who have some activity. And there are other extensive metabolizers who have a ton of activity, that little tail over on the left. So, what is the explanation? Well some of it is just variability across individual patients for reasons that we don't understand, but there are patients who are known to have more than one copy of the CYP2D6 gene, and in fact when you have more than one copy, your liver processes the gene in the way its used to but generates twice as much or three times as much or 13 times as much protein depending on how many copies of the gene you have. So our ultra rapid metabolizers are individuals who are at that tail of the distribution, often they're ultra-rapid metabolizers, because they have more than one copy, more than one functional copy, of the CYP2D6 gene. And that's a genetic variant that's particularly common in certain parts of East Africa and The Arabian Peninsula but occurs world wide. So the problem in this child was that they got coding, they're an ultra-rapid metabolizer that generate huge amounts of morphine from the coding and required rescue with the opioid antagonist. This story goes back a long long long way. This is a study long before anybody had heard of CYP2D6, or even deprizine for hydroxylase, done by an investigator in Sweden, and he looked at plasma concentrations of what was then one of the most widely used antidepressants in the world, nortriptyline. And what he noticed was that there was tremendous variability in plasma concentrations of nortriptyline. There were some individuals on the right who had very very high concentrations, that one bar on the right. Each bar is a patient, that one bar on the right is probably a poor metabolizer. Their concentration is very very high nortriptyline is a CYP2D6 substrate. There is also a couple of patients on the left who have no side effects. The side effects are patients who have asterisks over their little bars, who have no side effects but also have very, very, low drug concentrations. So time passes, 25 years later we start to understand the mechanism underlying variability in CYP2D6 substrate plasma conentrations. And here's what happens with you give nortriptyline to patients as a function of how many copies of the CYP2D6 gene they have. Notice that if you have 13 copies, that must be some kind of world record of the CYP2D6 gene. Your concentrations of drug are very, very, very low compared to the concentrations in somebody who has one copy or no copies, the poor metabolizer. And the concentrations of the metabolite that's generated by CYP2D6 are shown on the right, and those, of course, mirror those. They're upside down. The highest concentrations are patients who have 13 copies, and the lowest concentrations are patients who have 0 copies, the poor metabolizers. So, that's an explanation for variability in drug response. It's been around for a long time. But now we understand the mechanisms. And just like we could with CYP2C19 in one of the previous modules, we can now make a little cascade of what the dose adjustments should be for a patient who is a poor metabolizer, an intermediate metabolizer, an extensive metabolizer, for CYP2D6 we often don't make the distinction between intermediate and extensive because there's a lot of overlap, and an ultra-rapid metabolizer with respect to drug doses of CYP2D6 substrates that are antidepressants and many of these the same drugs that are also CYP2C19 substrates so when a drug is a substrate for both the dose adjustment becomes a little bit riskier to make, or a little bit more uncertain, because you don't know exactly what the contribution of each individual pathway is. But, you're reassured, because there are two pathways. Another example that is taken on some currency, and some controversy is the the breast cancer drug tamoxifen. So tamoxifen turns out to be like codeine and clopidogrel a prodrug. Requires bioactivation, one of the major active metabolites is the compound called endoxifen. There are other active metabolites in. One of the major pathways probably the major pathway for tamoxifen bioactivation is CYP2D6. This is a study from Germany that looked at over a thousand patients with breast cancer treated with tomaxifen and followed the risk of recurrence over time. Now, what these investigators were able to do was take the entire population that was studied and genotype them and predict whether they would be extensive or poor metabolizers, and it turned out that the extensive metabolizers had a much better outcome then the poor metabolizers. That makes sense because the poor metabolizers fail to generate the active metabolite. The extensive metabolizers do. We don't expect absolutely everybody who is a poor metabolizer to have a breast cancer recurrence. Nor do we expect absolutely everyone who receives tamoxifen to be protected against breast cancer recurrence but there are these differences. These have become quite controversial. People have tried to replicate these data and sometimes they use breast cancer tissue as a source of genotyping material. And as we'll talk about in subsequent modules, cancers tend to have their own genomes. And so whether you can predict if somebody is going to be the extensive report metabolizer from a tumor block is somewhat controversial. And the difference here, it's not huge, it's not black and white answer. It's a bit of a shade of gray answer and so you have to ask yourself, is it worth the trouble of genotyping everybody just to see this relatively small difference. And again, it comes back to how complicated it is to get the information, how hard it is to interpret, what the cost of getting the information is, storing information, delivering the information and acting on the information. We'll cover all those topics in later modules. So as with CYP2C19, there is CYP2D6 inhibitors. The main ones in clinical use are some of the SSRIs, as I talked about in the previous module. And these are data, again, from a pharmaceutical benefits provider, Medco, in this case. And they asked the question, after somebody started tamoxifen, what is the risk of breast cancer recurrence in their data set, and clearly patients who are getting a CYP2D6 inhibitor along with the tamoxifen had a worse outcome than patients who were getting no CYP2D6 inhibitor and tamoxifen. You can, this is not a randomized trial, so you can ask all kinds of questions about whether this is a a real difference or a difference somehow because some patients maybe depressed patients or maybe patients who are taking SSRIs take them for different reasons. There's also a mythology that some of the SSRIs may actually help get rid of some of the side effects of tamoxifen, notably the hot flashes that women often complain about. Of course, getting rid of the hot flashes by using an SSRI may mean you're getting rid of the therapeutic efficacy as well. Those are all relatively controversial points. The hazard ration here is almost two, so that's a pretty large hazard ratio as you've seen in previous slides or previous examples, but again, retrospective data, quite controversy in the oncology world, but there it is. And it looks like tamoxifen metabolism is clearly CYP2D6 dependent and that must have functional consequences. In at least some patients. So we have again the situation of high-risk pharmacokinetics with a pro drug that requires a single pathway to activation and we now have three examples of pro drugs, clopidogrel, codeine, and tamoxifen where either the genetics or the presence of an inhibitor drug can result in failure of bioactivation and less therapeutic efficacy. You also have this situation of the ultra-rapid metabolizer with clopidogrel possibly, I said that was controversial. With codeine, there's absolutely no question. In fact, there's such a large effect of the ultra-rapid metabolizer that the FDA as I said before, has now recommended that codeine not be used for routine pain control in situations like tonsillectomy, where there is a risk of respiratory arrest. So again, the take home messages are there are multiple sources for variability in drug action, pro drugs and other situations of high risk pharmacokinetics are a special problem that. That were conditions me to look out for both in terms of the genetics as well as in terms of the potential for drug interactions. [MUSIC] [SOUND] >> [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/Huw1w/headache-during-venlafaxine-antidepressant","Headache During Venlafaxine (Antidepressant)","[MUSIC] So this module continues the exploration of variable drug effects and the various kinds of mechanisms that can underlie variable drug effects. And I've entitled this module, A Patient with a Headache After Taking an Antidepressant. So this is a 36 year old woman with depression and she tells you, that she's tried lots of different medicines but they all give me side effects. And so after a long discussion she agrees to try venlafaxine a commonly used antidepressant. She comes back a week later with headaches that were really severe, new for her. She stopped the medicine and the headaches went away. So what are the potential explanations. So, one possibility is the headaches are unrelated, but the idea that they come on and then they resolve with drugs suggests, that they are somehow drug related. It's unlikely this is non compliance. She clearly is taking the medicine and is having an effect, not the effect she wanted or you wanted, but an effect. So are there other explanations, for variability in in response to this kind of drug and I'll walk you through a story, that we'll continue in subsequent modules, because it's an interesting one. This story starts in the 1970s, and it's actually one of the by now ancient stories in modern pharmacogenetics. The man on the left is named Robert Smith, and the man on the right is named Michel Eikelbaum, and they working in the United Kingdom and in Germany around the same time in the mid 70s, both made the same observation using different drugs. So, the observation that Dr. Smith made was he was studying a high blood pressure medicine, who's structure is shown in the upper left corner, and that medicine is called debrisoquine, and is metabolized to an inactive metabolite called 4-Hydroxy debrisoquine. You can see the hydroxy group on the debrisoquine molecule. The mythology in our community is that he was asked by the pharmaceutical sponsor to do a pharmacokinetics study of debrisoquine. What's its half life and how high are the drug concentrations? So he agreed, he, he recruited a bunch of post doctoral fellows and graduate students and research technicians in his lab and he made the critical mistake, of being a participant in the study himself. He took an ordinary dose of debrisoquine, that everyone else tolerated and he had severe profound, low blood pressure for a couple days afterwards. So what we say is that because it was him. He devoted the resources of his laboratory to try to understand, why this happened to him. Had it been a graduate student, he might have just said, well I'm not interested. So, that's one story and I'll tell you how that story turns out. The other story is, it took place in Germany with a drug that was used both in obstetrics and in cardiology, called spartane. Spartane undergoes in oxidation at the position shown with the arrow and patients who have high spartane levels, have side effects and there's a unusual small number of patients, who get a very high incidence of side effects with a relatively normal dose of spartane. So what Dr. Smith and Eikelbaum showed, is that the very ability in response, so starting with Dr. Smith and his debrisoquine, what he showed is he was unable to form the four hydroxy metabolite. So what happened, is that the parent drug the debrisoquine, accumulated very high concentrations in his blood and caused low blood pressure. The same thing happens to patients with spartane side effects, the parent drug accumulates to very high concentrations, because they're unable to get rid of it by metabolism. So, for a long time, we call it, talked about debrisoquine hydroxylation or spartane anoxidation, but it It turns out that's exactly the same enzyme. The enzyme is cytochrome P 450, or CYP2D6. CYP2D6 is responsible for the metabolism of about 25% of the commonly used drugs. So right after CYP3A, for and related members of the CYP3A family, CYP2D6 is the most important drug metabolizing enzyme in the liver. Interestingly, it makes up a tiny proportion by weight, but by importance, in terms of how many drugs it metabolizes, it's one of the most important drug metabolizing enzymes and one of the most polymorphic. So if you look at a large population and ask the question, how much activity does this person have of CYP2D6? And there's ways of measuring the activity, I won't go into the details, but you can see there's a funny x axis here. There's greater activity towards the left, lessor activity towards the right and it's a log scale, so it's like from 0.01 all the way to 100. So patients, who are on the right in black really have very, very little activity of the enzyme. Patients who are the rest of the population in blue, have a wide distribution of activities but they're all able to have some activity. So we now understand the genetic basis of this and it turns out that very very commonly, perhaps 25% of Caucasians carry one loss of function allele and that's shown in this genetic cartoon as the little black box. Patients who happen to have two loss of function alleles are about 7% of the population and they have no functional CYP2D6. So a common, the header is like it trait is quite common, even the homozygote, so the compound has it's zygote trait this quite common. Unlike CYP2DC19 where there is one predominant loss of functional deal, here, there are hundreds of loss of functional deals. Some of them quite common, some of them quite rare, many of them are not snips, many are larger insertions or deletion. Their difficult to assay and it's difficult to know whether somebody from a genetic test is a poor metabolizer or not cuz you have to, you're always left, with the lingering concern that they might have some rare variant that you didn't assay. There is also this striking variability of variant alleles by ethnicities. So for example, the poor metabolizer trait is really quite unusual in Asian populations, but again, five to 10% of Caucasian and African populations. Most antidepressants are metabolized by CYP2D6, and, or CYP2C19. You can see the list here, and so it turns out that if you have an antidepressant that's metabolized by both, and you're a poor metabolizer for one of those traits, it doesn't make much of a difference, cuz you can always get rid of the drug, by the other pathway. But it does modulate the amount of drug that you have around. So this is an example of variability, in response to a widely used antidepressant called citalopram by CYP2C19 genotype and you can see, the poor metabolizers have a greater response. That's because they have higher drug concentrations and greater drug effect, they also run the risk of having more side effects. The rest of the population metabolized the drug and have roughly the same effects, you'll notice the differences are not large [COUGH], but they're, they are there. And, you can then make a cascade of how much you should adjust the dose of the drug, if you know somebody is a poor metabolizer. An intermediate metabolizer or a normal metabolizer for CYP2C19 for a variety of antidepressant drugs, as shown in this slide. So coming back to venlafaxine for a second [COUGH], here's a very small study from the Mayo Clinic, 38 subjects treated with venlafaxine, out of the five poor metabolizers in this study. So that's actually a pretty high incidence of poor metabolizers, it's about 13% or so, a little bit higher than you might expect. Nobody could tolerate even a low dose, they all got headaches, headaches go away after the drug was stopped. The remainder of the subjects all did pretty well. In fact, two thirds of them had a were able to tolerate therapeutic doses and had an effect. So with the background that I've given you, I want you to think about three questions, relating this genotype and this genetic effect to variability and response. So, the first question is, do you believe this? And that's an important question, because this is in a very, very small study, you know, zero out of five patients. Well, maybe there's something funny about those five patients. Maybe there's something funny about this particular practice. So it's a very small study and basing sweeping recommendations on a very small study is always dangerous. The second rhetorical question is, would you genotype your patients before starting venlafaxine? So I've already told you that the effect is small, there are many other antidepressants that are available. And in fact, no one's ever died of a headache, you can always argue that it would be nice to get people on effective antidepressant therapy, and that is important. But there are many alternatives, and genotyping is complicated. It's complicated to get this, this is not assaying one snip, this is assaying many, many, many kinds of variants. In a highly sophisticated way and then figuring out from the variants what the actual genotype, or what we call the diplotype is, the genotype on one [INAUDIBLE] and the genotype on the other, and the combination and the predicted effect on drug metabolism. So it gets complicated, just to avoid a headache. And the third question is, if you knew, if you had a patient who had previously undergone genotyping for some reason and the information was there. Would you use this? Would you look down the chart of that 36 year old woman and say, well, I see that you're a poor metabolizer for CYP2D6, so we won't try venlafaxine in you. There's soft data, but there's data never the less that you were unlikely to tolerate it. Let's try something else. So I think the answer to the third question, the way I phrased it at least, is perhaps yes. How do you get to the point where you have those readily available. That's an interesting question that we'll discuss in subsequent modules. So, it is important to have a list of these drugs in your head, there are lists that are available on the web. And the reading material will provide more comprehensive lists, but there's long lists of drugs, starting with debrisoquine and sparteine, two drugs by the way that no one ever uses and in fact never got to the market in this country. One reason that they never got to the market, is because they had this variability in effect and one of the spin offs in understanding CYP2D6 pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics is that a drug that is metabolized solely by that pathway. Is now unlikely to get developed by a big pharmaceutical company because they will say well, we're dooming five to 10% of our population to some variant response. So if we're gonna do that, let's find another drug that at least has a second pathway that it could be eliminated by or doesn't use CYP2D6. So that's an important learning lesson for drug developers and then there's a long lists of other kinds of drugs and other drugs classes. Antidepressants, beta blockers and other drugs that are active drugs that are substrates for CYP2D6. And then there are a couple important inhibitors that clinicians should be aware of. Two SSRIs, fluoxetine and puroxetine, the antiretroviral drug, ritonavir is an extraordinarily potent 2D6 inhibitor. It's not a very great antiretroviral drug I am told, but people use it in combinations nevertheless in order to boost the concentrations of other drugs. And then quinidine, the other antiarrhythmic, even at very, very low doses, does that are so low that no cardiac electrophysiologist, whatever they think they would do anything. Five milligrams, ten milligrams, 15 milligrams, those really low doses are very potent inhibitors of CYP2D6. So that's an interesting observation. So let me just tell you a story, that has to do with interactions in an unusual and unexpected way. This is a case report in the annals of internal medicine in 1985. That reported bradycardia in a patient receiving quinidine and timolol eye drops. So, timolol is a CYP2D6 substrate, quinidine is a CYP2D6 inhibitor. Group of my colleagues Vanderbilt, then went on to study this potential reaction in a very systematic way and the reason I show it to you is because there is an interaction and more importantly, or more interestingly, it involves Timolol eye drops. And people don't think about eye drops as a source of adverse drug effects, there just things you drop in your eye, but of course. The drug actually gets into the body and the amount of drug that gets into the body and hangs around, depends on metabolizer genotype and it depends on the presence of inhibiting drugs. So they took a group of extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizers. Gave them Timolol eye drops, low and behold there was no effect with placebo but heart rate lowering with the eye drops, more so, in the poor metabolizers than in the extensive metabolizers. If you then gave timolol or timolol plus quintadena you will see there is a greater effect with quintadena in combination with timolol. Timolol alone on heart rate and yet quinidine alone did nothing to heart rate just like placebo. And then when you look at plasma concentrations, plasma concentrations, not eyeball concentrations. Concentrations are highest among patients who are poor metabolizers, next highest among patients who are extensive metabolizers receiving quinidine, the inhibitor drug. And then lowest among patients who are extensive metabolizers and who don't get the inhibiting drug. So there's a drug interaction that is genetically based and that involves a drug, that is given by a root that we ordinarily don't even think about. Here's another example. Again, a little bit of a cardiac flavor, this is a very unusual case of flecainide intoxication. This is a 36 year old woman who presents with palpitations and near syncope. You can see her electrocardiogram shows these bizarre, very, very wide QRS complexes. It's a miracle that she has any blood pressure at all, she'd been on chronic therapy with flecainide for supraventricular tachycardia and chronic therapy with fluoxetine. She had developed acute renal failure with a Cr 4.5, but her potassium was normal. So one thing you would think of when you look at this electrocardiogram is whether this patient is hypovolemic. This patient was not hyperkalemic, this is flecainide intoxication, very rare syndrome and actually easily fatal. So how is flecainide eliminated. Flecainide, it turns out, is eliminated by hepatic biotransformation and by renal elimination. So she's sitting there taking fluoxetine, the inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP2D6 mediated metabolism. So the only way in which she can get rid of flecainide is through the renal route. Of course her plasma concentrations and her drug effects are all normal because she has normal elimination, but when the kidneys fail acutely, then she has no way of getting rid of the drug. So this is a double hit causing a severe adverse drug reaction. And a patient who is taking a drug that ordinarily isn't subject to these kinds of adverse effects because it's not a high risk situation in the sense that there are multiple pathways for drug elimination. So, I talk before about this idea of prodrugs being high risk situations, high risk pharmacokinetics is what I've called this. And poor metabolizers or people taking inhibiting drugs run into particular problems when they're taking prodrugs like clopidogrel. This is a separate example. This is an example with flecainide or timolaw of patients taking a parent drug and that parent drug is eliminated generally by a single pathway. Flekanide is the exception. And when that single pathway is perturbed, either because the patient's a poor metabolizer, or because the inhibiting drug is present. You actually get not less pharmacologic effect, you get exaggerated pharmacologic effect cause the parent drug accumulates and the parent drug is active. Accumulates in plasma and produces excess effects. There's some drugs where accumulation doesn't make much difference. If you double the plasmic concentration of a beta blocker most patients don't notice it, they might have slower heart rates. But of course if you double the concentration of a drug like flecainide or an anticoagulant drug, where a little bit too much can produce catastrophic side effects, then you'll certainly be aware of it. So this is another example of the phenomenon that I've called high risk pharmacokinetics. So in summary, again, we can always think about the mechanisms underlying variable drug effects and accumulations of a parent drug by genetics or by drug interaction can have large effects on drug action, especially in the setting of this problem of high risk pharmacokinetics. And this story again emphasizes, just like the last module with clopidogrel, this idea of how much evidence do you need to order a genetic test. How much evidence do you need to be able to. Able to act on a genetic test whose are already available to you. We'll be talking about that some more in later modules. >> [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/FGDaC/a-second-heart-attack-a-month-after-a-first","A Second Heart Attack a Month After a First","[MUSIC] The subject of this module is a man who has a second heart attack a month after having a first heart attack. And the major points are that we're going to talk a little bit about bioactivation of a prodrug. Mechanisms in general underlying variable drug effects, the question of whether genetics or functional tests are better to assess drug action, and then we'll start to talk a little bit about the question of the level of evidence that we need in order to introduce genetic testing into the ordinary flow of health care. So the story is a 62 year old man who's admitted with acute coronary syndrome. He undergoes cardiac catheterization, is found to have a relatively tight mid right coronary artery lesion with thrombus. It's successfully stented, he's discharged on clopidogrel, 75 milligrams a day. He's admitted three weeks later with recurrent chest pain, and at catheterization, he has in-stent thrombosis. So what are the potential explanations? So first of all, why do we use clopidogrel in a situation like this? Well, we have a randomized clinical trial, we have a number of them, this is one of the larger ones that compared placebo to clopidogrel in patients who presented with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. And over the course of 30 days, the incidence of a composite endpoint of recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, death or instant thrombosis was higher, as you can see in this graph, in patients randomized to placebo than those randomized to clopidogrel 75 mg a day. So one take-home message is that everybody who gets a stent gets clopidogrel. The other take-home message is that we can't guarantee that there will be absence of events on clopidogrel. So that's the fundamental biology. The most important question that we have to ask when we first see the patient is did you remember to take your medicine. Non-compliance is a huge problem, it may overshadow any genetic effect or any other kind of variable drug effect the patient isn't taking the medicine, the patient isn't going to have an effect. And there's many reasons why a patient might not take their medicine. They might forget, they might be prescribed 20 different medications a day and get confused, they might not be able to afford their medicines, they might not think the medicines are all that important. We have case after case of patients prescribed blood pressure lowering medicine and after a month they stop because after a month their blood pressure must be cured. So people need to understand why it is they're taking the medicine, how important the medicine is and among the many medicines they take which ones are the most important because sometimes people have to make choices. But compliance is a huge issue around the practice of medicine, and, of course, the practice of personalized medicine. So clopidogrel, let's talk a little bit about the way in which clopidogrel is gotten rid of in the body. Clopidogrel is an example of a prodrug, a drug that compound is not itself active but requires metabolism to be bioactivated. Most clopidogrel actually undergoes metabolism by esterases and never reaches the systemic circulation in an active form. The bioactivation occurs in the liver and for a long time, the exact bioactivation pathway was not known and a number of liver enzymes were implicated. It turns out the most important enzyme for clopidogrel bioactivation is CYP2C19, one of the members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. After clopidogrel is bioactivated, it then interacts with ADP receptors on platelets to inhibit the action of ATP to cause platelet aggregation. So that's how the drug works, and that's a basics of its clinical from oncology. There are important and common loss of function variance in CYP2C19 and they're shown on this slide. The most important and common one is *2 and depending on what ancestry you look at, *2 is quite common as you can see on the table. *3 is another variant that is quite common in Asian populations but rare otherwise across the globe and then *17 is an interesting variant. It tends to increase the activity of the enzyme so that patients who have the *17 variant you would predict would have greater anti-platelet effect with clopidogrel. And that's something I'll come back to at the end of the talk. And that's common in European and African populations much less common in Asia populations. So we call people who have two star one alleles as wild type or reference genotype. And then there's the intermediate genotype with one star one and one loss of functional allele and poor metabolizes and then the ultra rapid over on the right hand side. As an example we at our hospital have been genotyping patients for CYP2C19 for a number of years, and here are the results in. Over 13,000 patients in a population that is largely Caucasian but about 15% African American. The overall incidents of homozygotes, for star two star three, and then three other alleles that are quite rare but we see them anyway, is 2.7% for the homozygotes or the compound heterozygotes. 19.4% for individuals who carry one of those loss of function alleles and then the remainder approximately 78% or so have no variant that we detect. This is the results of a genome by dissociation study examining the outcome of clopidogrel induced inhibition of ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation. These are 400 patients who underwent ADP stimulated platelet aggregation in the absence of, then in the presence of Clopidogrel. This is an X vivo test and you can see that the results show that there is. Clearly one dominant genomic locus at which there are common variants that appear to drive variability in this trait. Interestingly, the way this study was done was in a large group of Amish subjects. They're all related to each other, and the relatedness allows one to estimate the heritability of the trait. Relatively accurately, so the heritability of this trait is large, 73% of the variability in the trait is heritable. That said, the signal that you see on the GWAS is right in the CYP2C19 locus. Locust and in fact when the authors corrected foe the fact that there were CYP2C19*2 they included that as a covariant that signal now goes away completely, what that means is that the entire signal that you're looking at is a sub CYP2C19*2 signal. Interestingly, only 12% of thew variability in the signal is accounted for by sub CYP2C19*2. So if you're a pessimist, you say, well, there's a huge amount of variability in this trait and a little bit of it is due to CYP2C19*2, and a lot of it is due to something else that we don't understand. If you're an optimist, and geneticists are optimists, they say well, It's extremely unusual to have a single snip that accounts for 12% of the variability in any trait, be it cancer susceptibility or acute myocardial infarction or whatever. So the genesis would say this is an enormous signal, and if you infactor in known clinical factors like BMI and lipids. You can increase the explanation for the variability, but you still have a large chunk of the variability in this trait unexplained, and that's a pretty common scenario across the genome-wide association world. So people have gone on to look relatively retrospectively at the outcome of clopidogrel therapy as a function of genotype in very, very large clinical trials. These are meta analysis showing the results of the individual trials, they're confidence intervals and an over all. Estimate of the affect size among subjects carrying one copy of a loss of function allele. And that generally means CYP2C19*2 at least in the non Asian populations and the point estimate is about with an odds ratio about 1.5 for a recurrent event. That means that there's 50% increase risk that patient taking clopidogrel will have an adverse event at the normal dose after receiving clopidogrel, like our patient did. Patients with two copies of varied alleles, there are fewer of them, so the point estimates have wider confidence intervals. But the odds ratio is 2.8, so that's pretty high. So the question is, do you in fact test everybody beforehand? The optimist would say well, I want to know whether my patient is a star 2 star 2 perhaps even a star 1 star 2 because I might choose a different drug or I might choose to increase the dose of the drug. The pessimist would say well that's a pretty small effect. Keep on telling about odds ratios of 100 and 200 and those are actionable. Here's an effect size that is 50% so why should I get excited about that? There's so much variability you haven't explained maybe what I should be doing is testing the way in which platelets aggregate during therapy. It turns out their patients who get clopidogrel and you test their platelets, and their platelets still aggregate just fine as though the drug weren't there and there are patients who aggregate just fine. So maybe instead of measuring genotype I should measure net drug affect downstream. And there are such tests that's controversial exactly where they fit in and how good they are predicting outcomes. The other thought is, well let me do the genotyping among patients who are star one, star two, I'll just increase the dose. And there's a little bit of support for that approach. Not perfect, but some support for that approach. What's interesting is, if you try to increase the dose in the stars two, star twos who have no CYP2C19 activity, or very little activity. You can't increase the dose enough to overcome the genetic defect. So one strategy is to say, well, the star two, star twos, certainly, have a defect and maybe they should be considered for an alternate therapy. Star one, star twos, maybe, maybe not, and that's the way many people approach that now. So clopidogrel is a Pro-drug and it is bioactivated, and this bioactivation occurs through a single pathway. So the problem with a single path way of course is that if anything interferes with its activity. Then the Pro-drug accumulates and the active metabolites don't get made and the pharmacological effect is missing. So a Poor metabolizer trait is an example of how you might lose that bioactivation. Are there other ways? Well, it turns out there are drugs that inhibit CYP2C19. The most commonly used inhibitors are the proton pump inhibitors, notably on Leprosol. And these are data, retrospective data, from a large pharmaceutical benefits provider that looked at the incidents of recurrent events after an initial prescription of clopidogrel for an acute coronary syndrome. And what you can see is that among patients who ended up on clopideogrel at a PPI there's a higher incidence of events compared to patients on clopidogrel. This is retrospective, it's not randomized, but it still suggests that there's a consistent signal. One question you might ask your self is well, maybe that's just because PPIs make people worse. PPIs have some affect on platelet aggregation, but it turns out they had a group of people that were only on PPIs. They didn't seem to get worse than people who received neither drug. So the answer is, it looks like from this retrospective examination, that there really is an interaction. Another group of investigators then did a very prospective study, involving about 3.5 thousand subjects followed for a year, after being randomized to clopidogrel + PPI vs clopidogrel + placebo. And if you look very, very carefully, there are two curves there but they really are super imposed So these data which are prospective and randomized argue that there is very very little, there is no affect of PPIs. The criticism against this study is that the event rate is quite low compared to what we saw In this study here for example. And there's a reason that this study wasn't continued longer it had to do with funding. But at this point it's hard to argue very strongly that the PPIs are absolutely counterindicated. But the weight of the pharmacologic evidence would suggest that at least very PPIs that are very potent CYP2C19 inhibitors probably aren't the best thing to use for patients receiving clopidogrel. And maybe other PPIs that are weaker CYP2C19 inhibitors are better to use, the strongest inhibitor is omeprazole. So we have the situation which a pro drug is susceptible to not working. Because it has this property that it requires activation, there's one pathway, and anything that interferes with that pathway will then result in failure of drug effect. We also have the situational course with the CYP2C19*17s that those patients may have excess effect. This is relatively small and quite controversial, with clopidogrel there are some who think the incidence of bleeding is higher in patients who carry this allele, there are others who say the signal is very, very small, those are complicated patients. And most people are not paying much attention to the ultra-rapid metabolizer trait, certainly not reducing the dose because of that. So what are the explanations that someone who comes in with an apparent lack of drug effect presents to us? In this particular case, the explanations were this is biology, the drug we have isn't perfect at preventing the effect that we're looking for. The patient might be non-compliant. The patient might have varied genetics that makes them not likely to respond to clopidogrel. The patient might be taking an interacting drug. And these are generic explanations that apply to many, many situations In which we find ourselves in modern therapeutics. And so the bottom line is that there is multiple mechanisms that can underlie variable drug effects. Pro-drugs are a special problem because they have this high risk property that they require activation through a single pathway and if that pathway is variable at all that there's a problem. And then there's the generic question that this story raises and that we're going to come back to over and over again and subsequent modules. And that is, exactly how much evidence do you really need before you start to say, I need the genotype or I would like to have the genotype or wouldn't it be interesting to have the genotype in this patient in order to guide my selection of drugs. There are other ADP platelet receptor antagonists on the market. They're a little more expensive right now, because clopidogrel is generic. And they have the advantage that they don't have genetic stories, they had the disadvantage of cost, and they had the disadvantage of other side effects as well. So a physician faced with this kind of patient may choose to use an alternate and the genetics may drive them in that direction. We'll talk more about those kinds of things in subsequent modules.

I come here since 1992, I have been working with over two decades. So I'm and a pharmacologist. My expertise is use basically electroencephology equipment is called a patch cramp technique to record the individual channels, and how drugs work on the heart. And also studying cardiac arrest related drugs. So as you know when a human heart, an animal heart beat it's generated by basically biological activities, electrical activities. This electrical activities is carried by individual ion currents from inside our cells. When before the reprogrammed IPS cells. Then he brings cells to give to me, I put the individual cells in this color bath chamber, CO chamber. Then use the micro electrodes recording how cells works. We can record individual. And channels activity also can record it within it's action potential from IPS cells. But the IPS cells can to the human cardio sites. You can record how IPS cells works same as a human in the body. First we do control. We call that y type. Is a similar normal cardiac myocytes. For example, from my IPS cells would clog up the individual control cells that makes your basic baseline how individual activity, individual internal activity how action potential looks like as a control group. Then individual diseases. For example, we could non code the syndrome cell lines because the non code syndrome will have a different type. Can generate a different phenotype diseases cell lines from cells that give to me. Then I use the individual diseases cell line compared to y type control cell lines. How it looks like, [INAUDIBLE] behavior look like. For example, for normal cardio IPL cells, for action potential recorded, we don't have abnormal activity. When Kevin give me API cells from diseased cell lines, I had process predicted this individual cell lines can generate abnormal electro activities. This abnormal electro activities can refract like a human arismius. Like an EKG. What kind, from a physical, electrophysiology, reflecting how disease happening in clinic. Genetic disease was funded. Because this is a genetic disease. This reflects a lot of individual mutation from, for example you cut the ion channels. Sodium channel, potassium channel. We have found a lot of variance, changes. When we bring genetic variation of mutation to the research lab. We can express individual ion channels then use a technique to identify individual channel activity and how this is a variation on mutation. [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/cZB82/long-qt-syndromes-part-2","Long QT Syndromes, Part 2","[MUSIC] We're going to continue our exploration of the Long QT syndrome and its implications for things like variable penetrance in this module. We started with this family and ended the last module with the disclosure that the affected sister has a mutation that results in deletion of three nucleotides, one amino acid, in the gene KCNQ1, which is one of the major disease chains in the Long QT Syndrome. The inference is that she has reduced potassium occurrence and that accounts for longer QT intervals in here compared to normal people. I want to start this part by talking a little bit about the problem of drug induced Long QT syndrome. So, so far I've talked about the congenital syndrome, congenital Long QT syndrome caused by rare variants or mutations in ion channel genes and genes that control their function. This is an article from the Wall Street Journal in 1999 describing how the drug company Glaxo was withdrawing an antibiotic named Rexor. And the reason they were withdrawing the antibiotic was not because of skin rash or anything like that but because occasionally patients receiving this drug would develop long QT intervals and an abnormal rhythm called torsade de pointes. Torsade de pointesis actually a very fast ventricular tachycardia that's polymorphic that actually is the cause of the abnormal rhythms or fainting or death in the congenital long QT syndrome as well. So this is what we call a phenocopy. Patients who develop, who get a drug, appear to behave as though they have the congenital syndrome but they by and large were not known to have the congenital syndrome. So that's a a phenocopy of the congenital disease and drug-induced torsade de pointes is one of the rare serious adverse drug effects that I spoke about in one of the earlier modules. And you can see on the lower right hand panel, that's an example of drug induced torsades de pointes. And in fact, I know exactly what patient that came from because I'll tell you about the patient now. This is a 78-year old man, who has coronary artery disease and has 13 years status post coronary artery bypass grafting and has congestive heart failure. He was given a drug called dofetillide which is actually a blocker of a potassium current called IKr. And mutations that result in decreased IKr are one cause of the congenital long QT syndrome. So the fetillide in this particular case appears to phenocopy the congenital long QT syndrome because patient two days after starting dofetilide developed drug induced arrhythmia that looks, that is torsade de pointes and looks like somebody with a congenital long QT syndrome. He's a little old to be presenting for the first time with a congenital syndrome. But he doesn't, and he has no family history of anything suggesting the congenital long QT syndrome. But we, as part of a research project that we have ongoing in our laboratories, got DNA from this individual and looked for variance in ion channel change and to our surprise, he actually has a variant that results in not a change in IKr, but a change in the other potassium current, IKs. We didn't find it in lots and lots of control individuals, and so our assumption is that this man has a very mild form of the congenital long QT syndrome that remained asymptomatic for 78 years. That's about 2 billion heartbeats, but then when he got a drug that interfered with the function of the second potassium channel, he developed this abnormal rhythm. So many patients, as I said in the previous module, particularly with the KCNQ1 variants, the LQT1 variants, many patients will be asymptomatic. And one of the things that brings out a tendency to have arrhythmias is exposure to drugs that block IKr. Now, we're still working on understanding exactly how many patients who have drug induced arrhythmias have this scenario. It turns out a minority, probably, have classic congenital long QT Syndrome and there are other risk factors that were just working to understand. But, this is a nice story of how the combination with drug and the genetic background combined to produce an abnormal phenotype type in this case in abnormal rhythm. This is another example that I think to tell a story, this is a 28 year old woman, who I encountered. Because when she was 16 she had a cardiac arrest and received an implanted defibrillators. The diagnoses of the congenital long QT syndrome was made at the time. She also has a very strong family history of sudden death and interestingly epilepsy. Again, we think many of those maybe related to abnormal rhythms and two cousins who also have implanted defibrillators. So we look at her electrocardiogram and her QT interval is actually quite long. It's very long, it's 523 milliseconds which is way, way out there. And marks her as a person at markedly increase risk. We do genetic testing, and I must say, the guess was that you would have a variant she would have LQT2. That's based on what her electrocardiogram looks like. But as I told you in the last module, that's sort of an intellectual exercise that we go through, we rely on the genetic testing. And the genetic testing in her revealed that she actually has two mutations. She's what we call a compound heterozygote. She has a mutation in the KCNH2 gene, which is the LQT2 disease gene, and gives the characteristic electrocardiogram that she has. She also has a mutation in KCNQ1. It's uncertain which of these causes the disease in her, and the suspicion has to be that it's the combination of the two. Between 5 and 10% of patients with severe long QT syndrome have more than one mutation as is the case in this person. And in fact it turns out that if you look at large numbers of patients, these are data from the so called long QT registry which has collected literally thousands of patients and their families with congenital long QT syndrome over the last 20 years has been exploring the relationship between genetics and clinical events in a variety of settings. This is one of many many examples that they have published and it just shows the event rate among subjects with more then one mutation is much much higher then the event rate among subjects who have a single mutation. All of them have the congenital long QT syndrome. And of course, you have to ask whether there's a relationship with the QT interval itself, the more mutations you have, the longer the QT, the greater the risk. So that's one story, this is the 28 year old woman's sister. Her QT interval is completely normal, completely normal and yet she is a mutation carrier. So either this mutation doesn't do anything to cause the congenital long QT syndrome or she has, she's one of those individuals who has. Reduced penetrance in other people who have the mutation could in fact could have long QT intervals, or it takes the combination of the two in the sister to create the really long QT interval. We don't know the answer to that question yet, but it presents interesting problems in terms of trying to figure out what the right thing to do for individuals like this. And of course we would have never known about an individual like this before there was genetic testing, we'd have looked at her cardiogram and said you're off the hook no problem for you. And it may be that she's not completely off the hook or her children may be not completely off the hook. At the very least she should avoid certain drugs that cause the congenital long QT syndrome. And after this module is over, we will show you a website that actually lists the drugs that are particularly prone to cause this reaction among normal individuals, and among individuals with a congenital un-QT syndrome this is a really amazingly unusual electrocardiogram. This is a cardiogram that we encountered in a 26 year old woman, who was deaf since birth. She had a life long history of seizure disorder and she came in with recurrent syncope after the birth of a child. There's some question about whether the peripartum period is a period of higher risk, it turns out for this particular form of the long QT syndrome. I'm not sure that the data support the idea that this is a period of high risk, but she has not only amazingly QT deformed intervals, you'll notice the T waves in lead V4. You'll never see T waves that are taller than that, but she has a QT interval that is almost a second long. 900 milliseconds that's amazingly long, and I've labeled this a 1 in 5 million electrocardiogram because what this woman has is something called the Jervell and Lange-Neil syndrome. So Jervell and Lange-Neil were two Norwegian investigators who first described the association between congenital deafness and long QT intervals. And one of the striking features of their initial family was that they not only had very, very long QT intervals look in particular, for example, in the lower right hand panel that's marked V4R. The QT interval is almost as long as the RR interval, which is really clearly abnormal, but in the family that they first described, they had six children, and four of them were deaf, and three of them were dead by the age of ten. They die suddenly from abnormal heart rhythms. So our patient was a little bit unusual in the sense that she lasted until she was 26 before the diagnosis was made and she has in fact the Jervell-Lange-Nielsen Syndrome. And the interesting question that you could ask yourself about this particular individual is who carries a mutant gene in her family tree? She has a mother and a father, she's the only child. She's married and she has three children of her own. And I will tell you that this is an autosomal recessive from of the disease. The reason her QT interval is so long Is that she has two copies of an abnormal allele, two abnormal alleles, one from mother and one from father. And both of them are abnormal alleles for KCNQ1 gene and it turns out that individuals who have two loss of functional alleles, not only have very long QT intervals, but also are congenitally deaf. And there's an interesting developmental explanation for that, which I'm not going to go into now. But the question when you look at a family like this is who actually has the autosomal dominant form of the disease, where they have one KCNQ1 allele? And the answer is almost everybody in this family. The mother and the father are carriers, correct? And then each one of her three children gets one of the abnormal allele, it might be different for the different children. Gets an abnormal allele from mom and a normal allele from dad, assuming mom and dad are not related. In this particular family, the mutations in this young woman were two different mutations. And what was really even more unfortunate for her, so you could say, well how do you get two mutations? You're just incredibly unlucky to have two parents, each of whom has an abnormal allele. And they marry each other and you're the one in four who inherits both of the abnormal alleles. But she was even more unlucky because it turned out that the mother was not a mutation carrier, and that the allele that she got from the mother underwent a process called de novo mutation. So she gets one abnormal allele from father and then the allele that she gets from mother carries an abnormality in it that was not even manifested in the mother, a so called mutation. This is really really an amazingly unusual situation, but the point is that each one of her children now carries the autosomal dominant form of the disease the more benign form. And may or may not have long QT intervals but they certainly need to be aware of the fact they shouldn't be taking certain drugs. So let me think about the problem of variable penetrance and the way in which we think about the problem of variable penetrance starts with a genome wide association study of variability in the normal QT interval in tens of thousands of individuals. This is one such study that was published in 2009, there are others that have come later that have much larger numbers of subjects. But you can see here that there are many low si at which variance, common variance confer variability in the QT interval. The amount of variability they confer is really tiny. It could be a millisecond one way or the other. And notice that one set of genes are genes which, again, rare variance caused the congenital long QT syndrome. Here, common variants cause tiny little changes in the QT interval among normal individuals, why my QT interval might be 3 milliseconds less that somebody else's because I have a set of alleles that make mine a little bit less long than somebody else. The most important signal, or the signal with the highest speed or the lowest speed value in this particular genome-wide association is neuro gene called NOS1AP. In NOS1AP, we think encodes some modulator of cardiac calcium and potassium occurrence although, it's function and the way in which these particular variants confer variability in the QT interval is still not really known. But concentrate on what we call the NOS1AP gene and this is what happens. First, the bottom part is the important, is one part of the story. A group looked at on a very large number of families in South Africa, all of whom have long QT intervals because they all have a mutation or the members of the family who are affected, they all have the same mutation in the KCNQ1 gene causing LQT1. The specific mutation in all these families is the same A341V and if it turns out. If you go to the churches and do genealogy, you can trace all of these families back to a single immigrant from Holland who came over from Holland to South Africa in the 1600s. So that's what's called a founder effect, the immigrant brings the mutation, and then over centuries there are large numbers of families who actually don't even know about each other. Who have this mutation, some of whom have sudden death and some of whom just have the mutation all their lives and then transmit it to others, and it turns out that the one's who have events. The one's who have sudden death or syncopy carry NOS1AP risk alleles for longitude intervals as well as the mutation. And the graph at the top shows a different study from the Italian registry, again saying the same thing. The graph is the important one on the upper left, and it basically shows that if you have the NOS1AP variant, the common variant that in the population has a one millisecond effect, in combination with a mutation in one of the long qt disease genes you have a much higher chance of having an event. And the table on the upper right merely shows that no matter what combinations you look at, you could look at LQT1 with or without a NOS1AP variant or LQT3 With or without a NOS1AP variant. LQT2 with long QT intervals at baseline or short QT interval at baseline. No matter how you cut the data, the presence of the NOS1AP variant always confers about a 25 to 50% increased chance of having an event. So what we have here is a story where the common variant modulates the pentetrants of the disease, which is an interesting new advance that comes out of genome wide association. So again, I have this picture that I've shown before of large, rare variants that have very large effect sizes in families compared to common variants that have very small effect sizes across large populations. And the sweet spot for modern genomics and personalized medicine is in the middle now, where we have combinations of rare and common variance together that conspire to produce clinical phenotypes. I'm beginning to believe that there is no such thing as a monogenic disease. That all these diseases have their clinical manifestations modulated by other rare variants or common variants or their combinations, and that's how we get variability in the way in which patients present. So, the bottom lines for personalized medicine from the long QT syndrome and these modules has been that there's highly variable penitrants. We think we'd begin to understand, the mechanisms for highly variable penetrance. Clearly, there's a form of the disease that is autosomal recessive, which is very severe and there's a form of the disease which is autosomal dominant, which has much more variability in penetrance. And the problem that certain drugs may bring out the clinical phenotype and cause abnormal rhythms is particularly important for patients because as we now develop genetic testing even if the genetic testing shows variant and the patient has a totally normal QT interval the advice has to be avoid drugs that might make this worst.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/zhuIa/long-qt-syndromes-part-1","Long QT Syndromes, Part 1","[MUSIC] In this module, I'm going to start the discussion around a set of diseases call the long QT syndrome, or in my view, they should be called the long QT syndromes because there are a number of different subtypes. In this particular module, I'm going to talk about the background for the disease. And in the next module we'll talk a little bit about the way in which that influences management of those patients and how that has implications for drug development and also for managing other kinds of patients. One of the reasons that I want to talk about the long QT syndrome is because I have a special laboratory interest in that, so we've contributed a little bit to this literature that I'll tell you about. The story that I'm going to tell you starts with a family that is seen with a 17 year old daughter, who during a softball game, collapses and is unable to be resuscitated from a fatal, abnormal heart rhythm. Her autopsy shows that her heart is normal. Death in a young athlete is not an uncommon event. This a series of over 1000 cases from an investigator in Minnesota. And one of the commonest causes are diseases that affect the function of the heart, cardiomyopathies, hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, dilated cardiomyopathies. Those are relatively evident at autopsy and among the causes, there's a minority of subjects in whom the cause is not evident at autopsy because the heart is actually structurally and as near as anybody can tell otherwise normal. Obviously it's not because there patients develop fatal abnormal rhythms as the cause for their cardiovascular collapse. So this is the family tree of this family. The deceased young girl is shown in black, and there is another death in the family at a young age in a paternal great aunt. And she died, had recurrent seizures and died at age 24. And I will say that sometimes the abnormal rhythms that come up in the long QT syndrome can present a seizure like activity. So it's not uncommon for doctors to take care of patients with arrhythmias to encounter patients in whom the initial diagnosis is a seizure disorder, and it turns out that it's an abnormal rhythm. This is the electrocardiogram of one of the deceased siblings. And the cardiogram shows, I've blown up a piece of it on the bottom, and that cardiogram shows a really striking prolongation of the QT interval that's indicated on the slide there. And in fact, it's not actually very clear where the QT interval ends. It could actually be quite a bit longer than that, because there's a little sort of trailing tail. And people have big fights about exactly how to measure the QT interim but in this case it in incontrovertibly long. Normal values are shown on this slide along with the QT values that are obtained across this family, so when the family has electrocardiograms, the girl's brother has a QT interval of 435, which is in the border zone, as you can see from the table. The father has a QT interval of 410, and the mother has a QT interval of 390. Those are both normal. On the other hand, the paternal grandmother has a QT interval of 475, which is a little on the long side and suggests that this may be an dominant disease that's transmitted from the grandmother and with variable penetrance through the father, so that's what we have. Let me talk a little bit about the history of Prolonged QT syndrome. One of the major contributors to our understanding of this disease has been an investigator in Italy named Peter Schwartz. And he published a paper in 1985, laying out the state of the arch. And the most important part is in the upper left-hand panel that shows what has come to be known as the Schwartz criteria for deciding whether a patient is affected with the long QT syndrome or not. Subsequent versions of this table have included a point system so to decide whether somebody is or is not effected. And of course with genetic testing those systems have become a little less interesting. The graph on the upper-right shows his particular person experience with the use of other beta blockers or an intervention called Left Sympathectomy or blockade to remove sympathetic to all or part of the heart. And the contention is that patients who have had these anti-sympathetic maneuvers do much better than patients who have no treatment and that's shown in the table on the bottom overtime both with data from 1975 and data from 1985. Very high mortality rate in untreated patients, lower mortality rate in patients receiving beta blockers. Often these events occur with exercise and so there's this idea of the beta blockers ought to be particularly effective. These kinds of data lead people to believe that the fundamental defect would be a defect in sympathetic signaling to the heart. And that turns out to be not the case but an interesting idea to start with and clearly identifies a set of interventions. So let me talk a little bit about the molecular basis for the long QT syndrome. There is the QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram and when we see a QT interval like that, we can infer that there are individual cells that have signals called action potentials, that are shown on the top. And the duration of an action potential roughly corresponds to the duration of the QT interval. Duration of action potentials in the ventricle, the main pumping chambers of the heart. Now of course there is heterogeneity across those action potentials, and that turns out to be quite important for some people's thinking about long QT syndrome, and the genesis of arrhythmias. I'm not going to touch on that part here, but there will be references that will be provided, and those will discuss that part further. So when we think about what shapes the QT interval we have to think about what shapes the action potential at the level of the individual cell. And that long plateau, that part from the fast upstroke that's mediated by fast inward sodium current is mediated by a balance between inward currents through sodium and calcium channels and outward current through potassium channels. Channels are tiny r proteins that are embedded in the cell membrane, whose mission in life is to transmit ions from one side of the cell to the other. And so when I see, or when an investigator sees a QT interval that is long, you have to infer that there's action potential prolongation in at least some cells in the ventricle. And when you infer that, what you say is well there's only two ways that action potential can get long, one is to have an increase in inward currents, or in the other way is to have a decrease in outward currents. That's fundamental elect cardiac electrophysiology. So it turns out that the vast majority of patients with Long QT syndrome had mutations and the genes that encode cardiac ion channels. And the most common are called LQT1 and LQT2, and those result in decreases in individual potassium currents that are shown on this table that are called IKR and IKS. And that's pretty irrelevant for the purposes of this discussion. The third common category is a mutation in the gene that encodes the cardiac sodium channel, which we call SCN 5A. And those mutations result in an increase in sodium current. So again, increase in inward current or decrease in outward current results, in almost all cases of the congenital Long QT Syndrome. There's a long list of rare, rare variants in many, many other genes, most of which interact with other potassium channels or sodium channels to change their function. So this is a disease of ion shells. And most cases are caused by mutations in one of those three at the top of this table. So there are some really interesting implications of understanding the fact that there are subtypes and they're shown on this slide again from Doctor Schwartz who started to investigate the possibility that individual subtypes of this disease, all of whom look pretty much the same when you see them individually because their QT intervals on their resting cardiogram are normal, may have different clinical manifestations. So patients with LQT1 form, one of the potassium channel related forms often have their events and event is a cardiac arrest or an episode of fainting due to abnormal heart rhythm during exertion. Patients with the sodium channel related form the LQT3 form tend to have events during sleep. Similarly, there's this mythology that if someone dives into the water, or someone has an event while they're swimming, they almost always have the LQT1 form. And that is true. On the other hand, there's a different form where patients have their event after an auditory stimulus. These are young children and they often will faint during a fire alarm at school or when the telephone rings at home or when an alarm clock rings. And so that is a pretty typical story for the LQT2 form. So these are interesting clinical tidbits that tell us a little bit about the different subtypes. So is there any importance in identifying the subtypes a little bit? This is a very large study from a registry that took place in Italy and studied 647 patients from 193 families and what you can see is a couple of things. Number one, patients with the LQT1 form are the commonest. They're about 350 of those and they, most of those patients, by the time they reach 40, have not had anything go wrong with them. So you could say, well this is a pretty benign disease, on the other hand a disease that kills young athletes, or a disease that causes potentially fatal fainting spells, syncope in a third of affected subjects is not so benign. The other two forms tend to have more events as you can see from the graph. And what we know is that the most important predictor of events among mutation carriers is how long their QT interval is. Patients with very long QT intervals to start with are at much higher risk than patients with very low, much shorter QT intervals. The question of exactly how to treat them, what the best way to treat them is very controversial, and I'm not going to get into that, clearly beta blockers are one mainstay of treatment. And one of the reasons that they are a mainstay of treatment is shown on this slide. I'll come back to that slide that I skipped in a second, but it's shown on this slide If you look at patients who receive beta blockers, there tends to be much less events among patients receiving beta blockers who had so called LQT1 form compared to the other two forms. There's physiologic rational for that, turns out the potassium channel that's encoded by the LQT1 disease gene is regulated by adro-energic stress. So it may be that before we had genetics, what we had was a collection of disease subtypes, most of whom have mutations in a gene that is regulated by adro-energic stimulation, and is therefore respond to beta blockers. The other forms don't respond as well as great controversy about whether they respond at all because we don't have placebo on this slide but clearly we have a better response in LQT1. I skipped this slide before so I'll come back to it. One of the other interesting things about this disease is that knowledgeable cardiologists can actually look at the electrocardiogram and try to guess from the electrocardiogram what the specific disease gene is. It's a little bit of an intellectual exercise, because at the end of the day, genetic testing is the way to find that out, not by guessing. But there is this interesting association between various patterns, and I suggest that the pathophysiology of the diseases are a little bit different across individual subtypes. So come back to this family. The fact that this girl had her event while she was playing softball suggests that this is the LQT1 form related to the potassium channel called KCMQ1. We didn't have material from the autopsy, that would have been the best way to do genetic testing. In principle, you do genetic testing in an individual who has clearly the phenotype. So that would have been the girl who died but in the absence of the girl who died, we'd do genetic testing on the person who's most obviously affected, which is her sister and the sister turns out to have a mutation in KCNQ1. That's not a single point mutation, but actually deletes three nucleotides, so results in deletion of a single amino acid, a phenylalanine at position 340 in the protein. So what do I take away, and we do genetic testing in the rest of the family and here are some interesting results. First of all, as we thought before, the grandmother and the father are carriers. The father has a normal QT interval and yet he had a daughter who died and a daughter who has manifests the disease. So that's called variable penetrance and I'll talk a little bit in a subsequent module about what might be influencing that. The other interesting part is that the brother has a QT interval, that's 435 in the border zone, but in fact does not carry the mutations. So he's off the hook. And that's important because if he thinks about having children, his children have a 50% chance of inheriting an abnormal allele where he to have one. But he doesn't so he's fine. The affected sister has to think about when she has children 50% of them will be mutation carriers, whether they have a severe phenotype or not is something that we don't yet know how to predict. So what does this part have to do with individualizing care? First of all, as we understand the nuances of a disease like the Long QT Syndrome, we understand the problems of variable penetrance, we understand problems of variable molecular subsets and how they respond to disease. And as I'll talk about in the next module, there are also implications for what kind of commonly used medications might actually affect risk in mutation carriers. So all of this has come because of our understanding of the fundamental basis of the disease itself and understanding the fundamental basis of the disease itself is then informed the way doctors who take care of patients with abnormal heart rhythms think about these ion channels and how they might go wrong, not only in the Long QT syndrome, but in other kinds of diseases where abnormal rhythms turn out to play a big role.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/ZBTe5/hla-mediated-immune-reactions-skin-rash","HLA-Mediated Immune Reactions (Skin Rash)","[MUSIC] This module deals with immune mediated drug reactions which are among the most feared and actually among the increasingly well understood reactions. The story starts with a 16 year old girl who has difficult to manage epilepsy. A drug called carbamazepine, one of the relatively standard anti-epileptic drugs is started. And within a week, she develops a really severe adverse drug reaction. That it basically involves sloughing of the skin. This is not her. This is other example and it shows the sloughing of the skin around the tongue and on the face. This is called Stevens-Johnson's syndrome and it's more severe cousin is also known as Toxic Epidermolysis syndrome. Very rare. Potentially fatal. Treated like a burn basically. The story around individual susceptibility starts with a report from a chinese group in nature that looked at specific HLA variants, and I'll come back to what that means in a moment. But they found a set of genetic variants in this set of genetic variance that mark risk for Stevens-Johnson syndrome during treatment with carbamazepine. And the specific variant that they were interested in is the variant called B*1502. And you can see on the bottom of this slide that this confers odds ratios that are 2500 or 900. So we've talked about odds ratios. This is a small set of patients with enormous odds ratios. So this is pretty convincing. So I'm going to say a little about HLA. HLA is the most highly polymorphic locus in the entire human genome. There is a series of individual genes in the HLA locust that are shown here. The nomenclature is shown on the bottom there, A alleles, B alleles, and then there are star, the major type and the major subtype. So B*1502 is the risk allele. For carbamazepine induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome. What HLA proteins do is they take small peptides and the present them to T cells. And the small peptides are usually derived from things like cancers or infections, and they allow RT cell systems to respond to those challenges by destroying the particular cell that is expressing the foreign antigen. We'll come back to that as a potential mechanism in a moment. So that was carpimezapine in an East Asian population. Other investigators across Europe have looked at carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome in Caucasian populations and you can see with 22 cases, a tiny number of cases and a very large number of controls, these are population controls not necessarily exposed to carbamazepine, there's a very strong signal again, at the north end of chromosome six. That's typically in the HLA region. What's interesting about this signal is that it's not B*1502, but it's A*3101. So that suggests that in different ancestries, the risk alleles may be different. An important generalizable lesson across genetics and pharmacogenetics. Another really, really high profile example is with the antiretroviral drug abacavir. In early 2002, a group from Perth, Australia reported that among patients with abacavir hypersensitivity reactions there was a really, really much increased frequency of the HLA-B*5701 alele compared to patients who had received Abcavir and who did not develop skin reactions. With odds ratios that are again very, very high, up to 822. Four combinations. So one school of thought would say let's start to test patients who are receiving carbomezopine or abacavere for these alleles, and avoid those drugs in patients who carry risk alleles. Another school of thought says, well, we have to have randomized clinical trials. Now, we'll come back to the issue of when is it appropriate to demand a randomized clinical trial or not, but the group in Perth went ahead and organized a randomized clinical trial and the results are shown here. The design of the trial was basically to take 2000 patients who were starting antiretroviral therapy and who were targeted for Abacavir as part of that initial therapy. A 1,000 of them had genotype guided therapy that is they had testing for B*5701 and if they had the riscollio, they would not get abacavir. The other group went ahead and got normal regiment that included abacavir. You can see that the incident of skin rash was around 6% in the control group and around 3% in the genotype guided group. So you would say, well, the genotype guided treatment does seem to reduce the incidence of this potentially fatal adverse drug reaction, but doesn't get rid of it. But what these investigators had done that was incredibly important for this study was that they had developed a method to actually look at each skin rash, assay the skin, and understand whether the rash was due to abacavir and abacavir immediated immune reaction or not. And when they did the immunologic testing every single patient who got abacavir genotype guided with a skin rash turned out to have a skin rash from something else. So there were actually zero cases of abacavir related skin rash among the genotype guided treatment and about 3% of cases that were really confirmed Abacavir related skin rash in the control group. So based on these kinds of data, abacavir genetic testing has now become pretty routine across the world. How does this work? One thought is that abacavir, or drugs like it combined with antigens that we have floating around in our bodies to which we become tolerant. There are proteins floating around all the time. Abacavir and the protein together create what's called a neoantigen and that is recognized as foreign. And in some way, the T-cells then attack the foreign antigen. Now an alternative therapy, an alternative theory is shown in this particular slide. The idea is that abacavir slides into the HLA-B*57:01 version of HLA. That's a particular protein whose job in life is to present a particular peptide to the T cell. But when abacavir has slid into the binding groove for that particular HLA. It changes it's confirmation. And, It changes it in a way that gets proteins that are ordinarily not recognized by the T-cell and the T-cell then attacks those particular cells, and for some reason the culprit protein whatever it is lives in the skin. Of course the reaction is not necessarily always confined to the skin. It can include the GI tract, include the lungs. In which case people would present with diarrhea or pneumonia. And we think this is what's going on. So they're competing theories, but it's clear that there's something about the structure of HLA-B*57:01 and the way in which it combines with abacavir that changes its function in such a way as to allow this reaction to occur. As I said before, regulatory agencies around the world have relabeled abacavir to really strongly recommend genetic testing before the drug is started. And most importantly professional societies have gone along with this particular recommendation so this has become relatively routine in the HIV therapy world. Again, let me summarize by saying that immune reactions are an important cause of rare, but severe, drug reactions. We're beginning to understand the mechanisms and much more importantly. We're beginning to identify specific molecules with specific genetic variants in which risk is dramatically increased. And that risk is pretty easy to show in even very, very small cohorts. So just like with the syntha statin story, this kind of story raises the possibility of everybody knowing what their HLA genotype is. And when a drug is prescribed we say well avoid this particular drug because you're at higher risk for developing this severe drug reaction compared to a person that doesn't have that risk allele. And again as we've seen already, and as we'll see increasingly, some of the risk alleles are confined to specific ancestry. So just because we know what the risk allele is that are Caucasian population doesn't mean that the same risk allele will be present in an African population or in an east Asian population.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/cCQzi/using-genomics-to-find-new-drug-targets-familial-hypercholesterolemia","Using Genomics to Find New Drug Targets: Familial Hypercholesterolemia","[MUSIC] In this module, we're going to continue discussing this particular patient, but from a different point of view. And that is how we use information about lipid regulation to identify new drug targets. And then we'll talk a little bit about other Ways in which genetics can inform the identification of potential new drug targets. A very exciting and interesting area I think. So, I've presented this case to you before, and here is his family tree with lots and lots of Hypercholesterolemia odosominal dominant way, so gets interested sequences is LDLR gene, the gene that encodes the LDL receptor, expecting to find a mutation in the family, and low, and behold nothing is found. So, we see families that had clearly have autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia but do not have a mutation in the LDLR receptors. So where else might a receptor might a mutant mutation be? So one clue might be provided by genome wide association. This is a genome wide association that points out loci that regulate cholesterol in a group of 19,000 patients. And you can see that LDLR receptor is on that plot, and what that means is that there are common variance in the LDLR receptor that contribute in a very, very modest way to variability and LDL cholesterol. This interesting example that will recur throughout our discussions of how common variance in specific genes might have very small effects on a particular physiologic process, and rare variance might have enormous effects on that same process. But this process is also identifies a set of candidate genes that might be interesting in terms of looking at for rare variance in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia that don't have mutations in the LDOR receptor in LDOR. So that was 19,000 patients. And that was in 2009. So through collaborations across the world, investigators have accumulated much much larger data sets, and the results of that are shown here in almost 200,000 individuals. And the relationship between genetics variation and individual genes that control LDL Triglycerides, HDL, and ultimately coronary risk which is not shown here. You can see that there are sets of genes that contribute to variability in LDL but don't do anything else. There are other genes that contribute to variability in LDL and HDL but not anything else. And in this Venn diagram there's overlapping sets that actually encompass almost every combination that you could think of. So this creates a very, very large set of candidate chains for familial hypercholesterolemia. The other way of approaching candidate chains is to understand a fundamental underlying physiology in the process that we're studying and therefore understand what candidates are. So Goldstein and Brown had already identified this idea of LDL receptors as the key mediators of handling LDL from the outside of a cell into the cell. And then signalling within the cell, and then what it turns out that the LDL receptor itself, the protein, it shuttled from the cell surface inside the cell. And then dissociated from the LDL particle, and the receptor itself makes its way back to the cell surface to be used again. And there are a number of proteins inside the cell whose function is to modulate that particular process. One of which is a gene called PCSK9. PCSK9 actually showed up on the G WAS that I just showed you and on that large overlapping set of Van diagrams as a regulator. Of LDL cholesterol. It's function and regulation was actually not well known when this particular story evolved. But its clear that mutations in the PCSK9 chain cause autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. The initial idea was tha if you had a mutation, somehow or the other, the function of that gene would get destroyed and perhaps that would mean a change in LDL receptors coming to the cell surface. It turns out that the mutations that cause familial hypercholerstolemia probably result in actually fewer, fewer LDL receptors of the cell surface. It looks like what PCSK9 does is it binds to the cell surface binds to the receptor inside the cell. And once bound, the receptor and the PCSK9 complex are actually degraded. So an overactive PCSK9 results in fewer cell surface receptors. We didn't know that when this paper came out in Nature Genetics. There's a lot of speculation about the mechanism and it turns out that that's probably the mechanism. And here's why we know a little bit more. This is a really interesting experiment. This experiment took place in something called the Dallas Heart Study. A study that recruited thousands of patients from the Dallas Heart area, Dallas area, and studied many, many things. But one of the things they studied was cholesterol handling and also the presence or absence of coronary disease, these are patients who are all middle aged. Now there's a very large African American cohort and there's a large Caucasian cohort. So what the investigators did was they said well, if we think PCSK9 is important for cholesterol handling, let's sequence the PCSK9 gene. And let's find variation in the gene that we know disrupts the function of the encoded protein. So the way you do that is you sequence the gene and you find Polymorphisms that result in early truncation of the protein, so called stop codon. These are nonsense variance, that's the other term for them. And they found a group of 85 patients with nonsense variance compared to about 3200 controls that did not have nonsense variance. And what you can see on one panel is the distribution of LDL cholesterols on the top among the 3,200 without the variants. And on the bottom, among the 82 with the variants. And you can see that the patients who had the variants had much lower LDL cholesterols. They had had low LDL cholesterols all their lives. And the other panel shows that they had much, much less coronary disease. They had a little bit but much, much less in patients who didn't have these non sense variants. So the assumption is that by knocking out PCSK9 function, and these are patients who only have one allele knocked out, the other allele is normal. There's a lowering of LDL cholesterol and a decrease in the incidence of coronary disease. So if you're a drug developer, you look at these data and say well, if I had a drug that could interfere with PCSK9 function, I might actually be able to lower LDL cholesterol And control coronary disease. And in fact this paper appeared in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2006 and in 2012 the results of the first clinical trials of an antibody against PCSK nine were reported in the same journal. And what you can see is that as a function of dose, these are patients who were given a single dose of an antibody against PCSK9, the larger the dose, the longer the effect, but some of the patients developed persistent 70% reductions in LDL cholesterol that last weeks and weeks and weeks after a single dose. So, this proves that inhibiting PCSK9 function either through genetics or through a drug results in striking lowering of LDL and the hope of course is that the drug would then result in a decrease in the prevalence and incidence of atherosclerosis and it's complications like heart attacks. Those trials are underway and of course everybody would like to have a pill rather than an injection of an antibody, but this trial is really important because it demonstrates the proof of principle that that's what that gene Interfering with that genes function does. So we had this story, I've shown you this slide before in one corner we have data obtained from genome wide association studies Is gwass where the variants we find are common across a population and the effect sizes are very modest. An odds ratio of 1.2, 1.5. Maybe 1.7 if you're really lucky too and then at the other end of the spectrum are rare variants that occur in families. We call those mutations that can confer really amazing human phenotypes like LDL cholesterol values of 352. Now, we start to fill in the middle. We're starting to see the idea that there are rare variants, not so rare as the familial hypercholesterolemia that confer large effects. The Dallas Heart study showed that there's a small group of patients among African-Americans, 2%, so that's not really rare, but it's not really common to have pretty large effects, large enough to catch our intention in terms of cholesterol regulation and certainly large enough to catch the attention of a drug developer to develop a new drug based on the genetics. So the story that I've just told you is a story of how rare variation can be a real clue to understanding what a new drug target might look like. These are all promissory notes. So here's another example. This example starts with a GWAS on pro-insulin levels in several thousand patients. You can see there's lots and lots of signals. And one of them is in a gene called SLC30A8. SLC30A8 encodes a zinc transporter. And there is some physiological rationale for thinking zinc transport my modulate risk of developing diabetes. So not only does devariant common variance in SLC30A8 modulate pro insulin levels as you can see in the inset, but they also modulate risk of type two diabetes with an odds ratio that is very, very modest. 1.14 with a P value that's pretty respectable. So, it's a real odds ratio, but it's a very small effect. Now, a group of investigators then asked the question, well what happens if we looked for coding region variants that disrupt the predicted function of SLC 30A8. So those are coding region variance that result in early stop in the protein just like the PCSK9 story, and here's the result of that study. So the first thing to notice is that there is an enormous number of patients that were studied, there were 30,000 cases of type two diabetes and 120,000 Controls. The Allele frequencies for these various stop codon variance are shown on that Y axis and they are as low as 0.05%, very rare Here in the population and as high as 0.4% so then all of these are very rare and that's why it lead very, very large numbers to get statistical significance. There were really three kinds of variance that were studied that are shown on the X axis. Two of them are shown and the other is a group of other stop variance, each one of which occurred once or twice in a population. Most of these patients came from Iceland but a number of them came from other parts of northern Europe, across Europe, and occasionally from other parts of the world. But mostly from caucasian populations. And what you can see is that overall, carrying one of these variants reduces the risk for type two diabetes by about 65, 70%. So again, if you're a drug company and you look at those data, you say type two diabetes is an enormous Medical problem. We have a drug that prevented the development of type 2 diabetes. That would be a blockbuster, important for human health and maybe this is the target. So stay tuned, maybe this will turn out to be a target, maybe this wont. One final example, is was featured in, not in the medical literature but in New York Times. This is a story from 2012 of a young woman in Georgia who cannot feel pain. And you would say, we'll that's a great phenotype to have because you break your arm and you won't be in tears but in fact, you could break your arm and not even know it. So it's not a very nice phenotype and that's showing on the bottom picture, when she was a young child, she had injured her hands and didn't know it. So these children can put their hands into boiling water and not know it. Of course they can still hurt themselves. The actual mutation that causes this particular illness in this child is not listed in the New York Times article, but there are other patients around the world who have been described to have this phenotype, notably in an article in Nature in 2006 that described three families. In which consanguineous marriages resulted in children with the inability to feel pain. The consanguineous marriages part is quite important because what it suggests is that the father and the mother both have a rare variant, that is perhaps prevalent in their family but not prevalent otherwise, and by marrying each other they strikingly increase the risk of a child having two copies of the rare variant and therefore the phenotype. And that's exactly what happened here. The children affected have two copies of a mutation in a gene called SCN9A, which encodes a sodium channel that is important for sensing pain. And that's the variance, all result in total loss of sodium channel. Functioned for that particular version of the sodium channel. And what's interesting is of course if you could develop a drug that could inhibit function of that channel a little bit, maybe you'd have a great analgesic to use after operations, or for anybody with. Chronic pain. Obviously these mutations are tolerated through life. You can see the picture of this young girl on the cover of the New York Times. She's developed normally and otherwise seems like a normal person so you could take that drug. The genetic data suggests that you can take the drugs that inhibit function of that gene and not develop some other amazing side effects. So these are clues, ways in which genetic data often obtained from very, very rare patients with very unusual phenotypes can inform the drug development process. So the take-home messages here are the studies of rare diseases, once again, are highly, highly informative for personalizing medicine, not just for the rare patient who has the really rare disease but for all of us. Where do HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors come from? Where are PCSK9 inhibitors going to come from? Those are all coming and they will be important for large numbers of patients. The other story of course relates to the fact that there are common variants that predispose to diseases like. High cholesterol or heart attack or type 2 diabetes. And those common variants, while they don't tell us very much about risk in an individual subject, understanding the complicated pathways in which those variants modulate, things like LDL cholesterol, can make us smarter, not only in terms of developing drugs, but in terms of predicting exactly what pathways are important for developing high cholesterol and therefore preventing the consequences of high cholesterol.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/wIlA1/from-rare-to-common-disease-familial-hypercholesterolemia","From rare to common disease: familial hypercholesterolemia","[MUSIC] This is the first of a series of modules. Each one of which discusses a case in personalized medicine. The first three modules we'll actually focus on the same case and different aspects of that case. And the problem is, in brief, a 42 year old man who routine physical examination and laboratory work is discovered to have an LDL cholesterol of 352. That's an extraordinarily high value and is a cause for some concern. So what I want to talk about in this module, and the subsequent modules, is the by chemical basis for a very high cholesterol. How that story evolved and understanding the genetic and molecular basis of an abnormally high cholesterol has informed drug therapies and has informed a new drug development. So this looks like a genetic problem, and in fact, is a genetic problem. The proband, the patient, is indicated by the red square and the rest of his family is shown here. Now, on further questioning, he has a very strong family history of premature coronary artery disease. He has, his father developed a myocardial infarction, an MI at age 42, he has an aunt who developed angina in her 30s, and his fraternal grandmother died suddenly at age 38. The common is cause for sudden death is coronary occlusion. So it sounds like he has pretty advanced coronary disease in his family. Let's look at the LDL cholesterol. His LDL cholesterol was 352, his father's is 408, also extraordinarily high. He has two siblings that have normal LDL cholesterol, both 92. His mother's cholesterol is also normal, at 110. The aunt with angina has an LDL cholesterol that's quite high, 210. And he has a cousin who has an LDL cholesterol of 280. So based on the pattern shown here, we would anticipate that as this is a genetic disease, it's probably autosomal dominant, male to female and female to male transmission. And the basis remains obscure. So. The story that I want to tell you today starts with these two investigators, Joseph Goldstein and Michael Brown, who were young faculty members that were recruited to go from Boston to Dallas in the early 1970s. They had trained in internal medicine, they had trained in genetics and they had trained in biochemistry. And the problem that they set out to solve was the problem of familial hypercholesterolemia. Now, the family that I've just shown you is a family with autosomal dominant, the autosomal dominant form of the disease. And I showed a small pedigree that indicates that. The disease, in its most full-blown form, actually occurs in patients who carry two abnormal alleles. The genetics had actually been reasonably well worked out. The familial hypercholesterolemia that occurs in patients with two abnormal alleles, the so called recessive form, that is an extraordinarily rare disease, one in a million. Literally, one in a million. Those patients present with extraordinarily high LDL cholesterol values, usually over a thousand, and a number of other manifestations including heart attacks, myocardial infarctions, often in their teenager years or before. And then deposits of cholesterol in pretty characteristic locations around the body. These lumps that are shown on the hands are called xanthomas. The xanthomas occur in the achilles tendon, on the hands. And then xanthelasma around the eyelids as in panel d, and then ocorcynalis, pretty typically, in panel c. So what Goldstein and Brown did was try to understand the fundamental about chemical basis for this disease. And in doing so, they defined a new pathway, they defined a new mechanism and won the Nobel Prize for medicine or physiology in 1985. Their story starts with, how do we make cholesterol? We make cholesterol from acyl-CoA as the initial precursor, through a number of steps that are shown on this slide all the way down to cholesterol. And the rate limiting enzyme in the formation of cholesterol is HMG CoA Reductase, shown on this pathway. So they knew that already. So they started the story by culturing skin fibroblasts from patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. That's one patient in a million. They start with the very, very extreme case and compare it to the normals. And what's shown on this slide is, they cultured skin fiber blasts and measured HMG CoA Reductase activity. So you can see immediately that the homozygote have enormously elevated values of this enzyme. And therefore, you can infer that that's the mechanism where by they're making lots, and lots, and lots of cholesterol and in a presumably unregulated fashion. So this is an experiment that occurred in culture, and what they did was they removed, they cultured the cells in serum, but then they removed LDL cholesterol, the cholesterol that is carried around in these tiny protein particles called LDL from the medium. And they watched what happened over time to both the normal and the homozygous. So here's the result of that experiment. And you can see the normal person, over time, and it's hours, and hours, and hours, the HMG CoA Reductase activity rises over time. It's as though the cell says, wait a second I'm not seeing any cholesterol, so I need to make more, and it up regulates the activity of the critical enzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. The homozygotes don't care whether LDL's there or not, and they make a huge amount of HMG CoA Reductase regardless. So that's an interesting observation, why the time delay? And it's as though the cell sort of understands how much cholesterol there is outside the cell from intracellular signaling. So then they did the next, the flip side experiment. Basically, they took those normal cells, and the homozygous cells, and they expose them back to LDL. And as they expose them back to LDL, over time, the cells said look, I have enough cholesterol now, and I don't need to make this HMG CoA Reductase anymore, and they go back to normal. So, the really interesting part's where, this part where the cell somehow sensed extra cellular cholesterol and made it an enzyme intracellularly, and that there was peculiar time course that took several hours to develop and then resolve. So the story, in a nutshell, is that LDL cholesterols carried, in a number of particles, cholesterol is carried in a number of particles, the most important of which is LDL. And LDL approaches a cell, usually a liver cell, they were working with skin fiber blasts, but liver cells is where the action, much of the action is. And the cell carries, on it's cell surface, a receptor for LDL. The LDL binds to the receptor and then enters the cell through a process called receptor mediated endocytosis. And actually, this is the very first example of the process called, of receptor mediated endocytosisin, and is one of the many contributions that Goldstein and Brown made to this field and our understanding of basic cellular biochemistry. Then the LDL particle is processed inside the cell. The cholesterol then feeds back to the synthetic apparatus in ways that they haven't quite defined yet. And cholesterol then turns off HMG CoA Reductase. Now the problem in patients with familial homozygous hypercholesterolemia is that they absolutely lack LDL receptor activity. No receptor means that there's a huge amount LDL floating around outside the cell. Left free to do all the bad things, including generate premature atherosclerosis. Because there's no cholesterol inside the cell to turn off HMG-CoA Reductase. So what we have is the story of a very rare disease. A one in a million disease. That then leads to the understanding of LDL physiology Pharmacology and makes us understand how high LDL in the circulation then results and premature atherosclerosis and most importantly identifies the important. Target for drug action. So understanding that HMG-CoA reductase is the critical step in this, a Japanese investigator in the early 1970s started a very, very long process of Of developing drugs that inhibit HMG CoA reductase Goldstein and Brown participated in that process. And Simvastatin, one of the most widely prescribed HMG CoA reductase drugs or statin drugs had world-wide sales of almost $7,000,000,000 in 2010. Lots and lots of randomized clinical trials have shown that statin treatment in patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia and patients with garden variety elevations of LDL cholesterol and even patients in whom there's modest elevation of LDL cholesterol have fewer heart attacks When they take statin drugs compared to when they take placebos and it's been one of the great advances in modern medicine and probably accounts for some of the reduction in coronary artery disease that we've seen over the last several decades. The other major contributor of course is the decrease in smoking. OK so the take home message is from this first module that focuses on hypercholesterol. Is the study of basic mechanisms in the biochemical space in the cellular biology is really really an important part of personalizing medicine. The studies here identified a drug target, identified a mechanism for a very rare disease as well as for a common disease and, notably, very few patients ever get their LDL receptor gene sequenced. We have other ways of detecting patients at risk such as measuring LDL cholesterol and other lipid particles that circulate. But the genetics has informed the way in which we approach this disease.

The way that we've dealt with it at Vanderbilt is to organize the infrastructure around genetic testing into the Center for Inherited Heart Disease. In that way, when clinicians encounter patients, who they suspect might have a disease with a genetic underpinning. Those patients can be referred to the Inherited Heart Disease Center where they are seen by physicians who have experience and expertise in these diseases, and the genetic testing. Both when to order it, and how to interpret the results, and they can also be seen by genetic counselors who can explain the testing both before it's done and help explain the implications after the results come back. So, I think that as genetic testing becomes easier, I think one of things we'll see is the rise of clinics and centers who specialize in making those determinations of when testing should be done and how to interpret the results.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/EeJaM/a-family-member-with-colon-cancer","A Family Member With Colon Cancer","[MUSIC] Today I'm going to continue the theme of family cancer susceptibility and we're going to start with a case of a woman who comes to you, she's 25 years old and she says, my father died of colon cancer when he was 47. Do I need to be worried? So the first thing that we do in a situation like this is we ask the details of the father's history, the mother's history, and go back through the rest of the family and ask if there's any other cancer or any other diseases. And when we do that in this particular In case we find that an aunt has uterine cancer and then the father's father also had colon cancer. So this is a family that you'd have to worry that there's something going on here that would make them susceptible to colon cancer. Colon cancer, just to review, is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. These are separated on this particular slide by mortality in men and women. Lung cancer, unfortunately, is by far, the leader. And then in men, prostate and in women, breast cancer comes in second, but colorectal comes in third for both and so across the United States, colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men and in women. Colon cancer, like breast cancer often has a family history component and you can separate that into people who have real genetic syndromes five to 10% of patients who will have a history like the one I just showed you. And then another group of patients who have a very strong family history, a suggestive family history, in whom we don't find a gene. And then the sporadic cases in green where we wonder if there could be a genetic risk factor. But there's not anything in the family that suggests that there is. The major syndromes that predispose to colon cancer, Lynch syndrome, which I'm going to talk a little bit about, the Familial adenomatuous polyposis syndrome, FAP, is also mentioned and then there's something called Gardner syndrome is a variant of FAP. Lynch syndrome, describe in 1966 by Lynch Two to 3% of all colorectal cancers. Typically in the right colon, the ascending colon, sometimes with multiple primaries, polyps can be present. It's an autosomal dominant disease. The lifetime risk of cancer is 80% so this is highly penetrate. It doesn't mean that you going to get colon cancer when you're 25, but if you live to be 90 you will have a high, high likelihood of getting colon cancer. There is an association with many other forms of cancer, including endometrial cancer As in this particular patient, gastric cancer or ovarian cancer and other GI tract cancers, and a smattering of other cancers as well. Lynch syndrome is now understood to be a disease of defective DNA mismatch repair, so there's this idea that cells, when they replicate, sometimes don't get the DNA exactly replicated right but they have mechanisms to fix that. In the case, in this case here, for example, the replication of the T Strand should result in an A but occasionally results in a G. So the body has mechanisms to correct that G back to an A and not let that mutation accumulate over time. And one of the genes that's involved in that is shown here on the bottom in a crystal structure and it's MSH6, which is the most commonly mutated gene in Lynch syndrome. So, the problem in Lynch syndrome is a problem of defective DNA mismatch repair. There are many other genes involved, but 90% of the mutations are caused by, 90% of the cases are caused by mutations in MSH6 or M MLH1. The pathological characteristic is microsatellite instability which is something that can be detected by the pathologist using DNA sequence analysis. And the diagnosis is either by germline genetic testing to find a mutation in MSH6, MLH1, or other Lynch syndrome associated genes, or by analysis of the tumor itself, to detect these mutations and the microsatellite instability. So faced with a patient like the one that I presented to you, the question is, should they have genetic testing for Lynch syndrome or not? And there are criteria that have been set out to identify patients who have a high likelihood of having a positive test. And those criteria are the so called Amsterdam II criteria. There are other criteria that have been described and there are so called the 321 criteria. So at least three relatives with colorectal or other Lynch syndrome associated cancers, this patient has that. At least two successive generations, this patient has that. And at least one relative diagnosed before age 50, this patient has that as well. You need to eliminate the diagnosis of Familial adenomatous polyposis, and it would be desirable to have the tumors verified by pathology. So faced with a patient like this, it's no different from a patient with a cardiomyopathy risk or an arrhythmia risk or breast cancer risk. The best person in whom to do the genetic testing is the person who has the cancer and in whom we can make or not make the diagnosis of Lynch Syndrome. And then we can ask the question is the relative at risk or not because we could say does the relative have the mutation that the patient who has the disease has. In this particular case, we don't have that luxury because the patient the closest relative has died of colon cancer. And that is often the case. We're faced with testing people in whom there's no cancer yet and in whom if we find a mutation we're never sure whether that mutation might be a benign fellow traveler or might be a causative mutation. So again, this is the problem that we face in a family like this. So the management in this particular case is genetic testing in the affected individual, if possible. If not, then this particular young woman should get genetic testing based on the Amsterdam II criteria. And if they have a mutation that is known to be pathogenic in one of those two Lynch syndrome genes or others. Then you can diagnose them as having increased cancer susceptibility. So if the genetic testing is positive, then colonoscopy every year or two starting at a very young age. The age is either 20 to 25 something like that or ten years earlier than the earliest case of colon cancer in the family. So the earliest case of colon cancer in this family was 47 so this person would start colonoscopies at age 37 or 25 whichever is younger, so age 20 or 25. And because this person is a woman and there's a risk of uterine cancer as well, gynecological exams, including the potential for trans-vaginal ultrasounds or testing of cancer markers that are circulating in the blood stream, Ca125, starting again at a relatively young age to detect early, and to treat early. The other disease that is much rarer but has an exuberant clinical phenotype is familial adenomatous polyposis. Very rare. Autosomal dominant, so a single gene mutation will cause this. And the mutation is in a gene called APC, which is a tumor suppressor gene. So again, you have a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene that wipes out its function. And all you need is a mutation in the other form of the tumor suppressor gene and suddenly you have no tumor suppression capability. The pathological or the clinical hallmark of this disease is carpeting, literally carpeting of the colonic mucosa by polyps. Very, very high likelihood of colon cancer by age 50 with other cancers that are listed here, stomach cancer, small bowel cancer, pancreas, thyroid, and hepatoblastoma in children. So that has implications for screening for cancers along the way. So the management of a person who's an FAP mutation carrier is sigmoidoscopy starting off at a very young age and once polyp polyps are detected, probably a prophylactic colectomy and you still have to pay attention to the ileal pouch and to the rectal remnant. To make sure that they're not developing polyps in those areas and have a cancer risk as well. Because of the risk of stomach and small bowel malignancies, upper GI endoscopy starting at age 25 and then every so often after that and in infants and in children screening for hepatoblastoma up until age five with ultrasound. On an alpha-fetoprotein measurements in the endoplasma. So I've gone over now two cases of breast cancer susceptibility in the previous module and colon cancer susceptibility here. And the problem is one, identifying patients who need to have referrals to specialized cancer genetic clinics. So that's the small five to10% slice. Perhaps the pink slice as well, the strong family history slice, although there's a chunk of those in whom we don't find mutations at this point. The big public health problem, of course, is the green part. And again colon cancer is one of the leading causes mortality so we've been focused on personalizing medicine but there's also an aspect to this that is preventive medicine and what do you do about preventing colon cancer a leading cause of death leading preventable cause of death In the United States. So there are guidelines from the Canadian Cancer Society that are difficult to read on this slide, but lay out for you what you should do in terms of screening people for genetic risk, high risk, medium risk, and low risk. But the most interesting category of all are the people who are at population risk. Because its the people who are at population risk who make up the vast majority of death from colon cancer. It it says meets know the criteria for genetic testing but still have Has a one in 16 lifetime chance of developing colorectal cancer. So the recommendations for genetic screening are interesting and part of personalizing medicine, but we shouldn't loose sight of the fact that this is a really highly prevalent disease and if managed correctly entirely or largely preventable at least in terms of deaths. And the way it's prevented is by annual stool fecal occult blood and regular examinations of the colon by x-rays or by colonoscopies starting at age 50, and that's the recommendation in the bottom green set of panels. So personalizing medicine is important. It's important to pick out people in whom special different kinds of approaches need to be used. But we shouldn't lose sight of that fact that this is a largely preventable disease if appropriate prophylaxis is put in place. So I think there are two bottom line messages here. [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/HffOg/a-family-member-with-breast-cancer","A Family Member With Breast Cancer","[MUSIC] Today, I want to talk about the way in which family history of cancer can effect the way we treat patients who come to us without cancer, but want to know if they're at increased risk or not. We'll talk about breast cancer today, and in the next module we'll talk a little bit about colon cancer. So, the case for today is a 37 year old woman who is seen for counseling. And the reason she comes for counseling is because her mother died at age 56 of ovarian cancer. Her mother's sister has advanced breast cancer at the time the patient is seen. Her mother's mother died of cancer we don't know what sub-type at age 45 and that grandmother's mother died at age 53, also of ovarian cancer. So this patient comes because they have a very strong family history both of ovarian cancer as well as a history of breast cancer. Now, the patient is Angelina Jolie. And, I know this history because I read it on the internet. When we look at patients who have cancer, some small proportion of them will give a very strong family history, as in this case. And of those with a very strong family history, there's a much smaller segment, perhaps 5%, perhaps 10%, in whom we can discover genetic variants that place them at increased risk for cancer. There's another 10 to 15% who will give a very strong family history of cancer. You have to suspect there's something genetic going on, but we don't at this point have the ability to identify the genes. And then for most cancers, the disease appears to arise sporadically. There's not a strong family history and we don't know the role of common or rare genetic variance in those kinds of families yet. As a matter of principle, the way in which we think this happens is that cells as they divide through the course of a lifetime, often when they replicate their DNA molecules don't do an absolutely perfect job. They occasionally will acquire a mutation. So you see the two chromosomes on the left, they've replicated and they've created a little mutation, a little red spot. Now the body has mechanisms to correct those mutations, DNA repair mechanisms. And so, most of the time, those abnormalities are repaired, and we don't accumulate mutations at a high rate over a lifetime. But occasionally, we will end up with a mutation in a gene, and that may or may not cause a problem. But over time, you get multiple mutations. And as that happens, the cell may develop the ability to start to replicate itself autonomously in a cancer-like fashion, develop a tumor. The way in which we think this happens, often, is mutations in DNA repair genes themselves may be a problem, and mutations in genes whose job in life is to suppress cancer, tumor suppressor genes, may acquire mutations and therefore lose function. So that's the way we think cancer may arise over a lifetime. The problem is that some people start life with a mutation in their germ line. So they start life with a mutation, and then over the course of a lifetime may develop other mutations. And it's the combination of what they're born with plus what they acquire and accumulate over a lifetime that results in the cancer. The reason I have the arrows drawn the way I do is that most of the mutations you acquire with each cell replication get repaired. So we don't accumulate them, but a small number do. And of course there are many things that cause mutations. Some of them are just random. And some of them are things like carcinogens, so tobacco smoke, for example, is the most commonly recognized form of an external chemical that can induce these kinds of DNA mutations that ultimately lead to cancer. So in the case of Angelina Jolie, the two most likely genes in which she harbors a mutation are genes called BRCA1 and BRCA2. They are involved in the DNA repair mechanism in ways that are not completely understood. So, if you take a person like Angelina Jolie, who has only breast cancer in her family. Well, let's talk about Angelina Jolie who has breast and ovarian cancer. 80% of the time, she will have a BRCA1 mutation, another 15% of the time, she'll have a BRCA2 mutation. And then there's a small number of other mutations that I'm not going to talk about that could also cause this familial susceptibility. Take patients who have only breast cancer in the family, and not breast and ovarian cancer. Then the likelihood is that she has BRCA1 or BRCA2, or one of these other syndromes, as shown on the pie chart on the top. So, faced with a patient who comes to us with the question, I have a family member who has cancer, should I get genetic testing? So, the specific question in terms of taking care of this particular patient is, does she have enough of a family history that genetic testing is something that we should do. One, some people argue that everybody should have genetic testing anytime they want. The problems are that genetic testing is expensive. The consequences of genetic testing can get expensive. Some of the times, the genetic testing results in results that we don't understand completely and it just confuses the patient. But in settings where there's a high likelihood that there's a genetic contributor to cancer susceptibility and we would do something about it. That's when genetic testing is most likely to be useful clinically. So in a patient we ask, are there more than two breast cancer primaries on the same side of the family, or breast cancer and some other cancer? And the other cancers are ovarian, pancreatic, and a number of others which I'll talk about. Is there a family member with ovarian cancer, period? Is this a family in which somebody is known to have a BRCA1 mutation? If you have a family in which somebody has a BRCA1 mutation, then genetic testing for that mutation is a very reasonable thing to do. And then there are two other groups that are at particularly high risk. One is Ashkenazi Jews have a 1 in 30 chance of carrying a BRCA1 mutation that predisposes to breast cancer. There are three mutations that are prevalent in the Ashkenazi population, so it's pretty simple to test for those three variants in Ashkenazi Jewish women. And then breast cancer arising in a man should really raise red flags that that may be a genetic syndrome as well, often BRCA1 or BRCA2. As high as 40 or 50% of men with breast cancer may have mutations in those genes. That, of course, is important for them, as well as family members who happen to share their genetic material. So, when we are faced with somebody who's doing genetic testing, we have to always ask, what will we do with the results if we get them? So, if they turn out to be positive or negative. So, if a person like Angelina Jolie were to get tested and have a mutation discovered in BRCA1 or BRCA2 that has been previously associated with cancer risk, we would say they are at increased risk for getting cancer. And then we'll talk in a little bit of what we would do about that. But that principle applies to genetic testing of all types, for cancer, for cardiomyopathy, for arrhythmia susceptibility. If you find the mutation that has previously been associated, that makes increased risk. But sometimes, that's not the situation. Now, what we would like to do, in Angelina Jolie's family and every other family, is actually test somebody who has cancer. Test somebody in whom we think there's a genetic contributor to cancer already established. We would test that person, if we found a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, for example, then we could test every other member of the family and ask the question, do they share that mutation? If they don't share that mutation, then they should be treated like any other person who comes to you and says am I at risk for cancer? And the answer is that you are at no more increased risk for cancer than anyone else. Another scenario is a patient who comes to you like Angelina Jolie, who says, nobody in my family has previously been tested. I have a very strong family history. And, what should I do? So, you do the testing, and it turns out they have no mutation that you can identify. The family history smells like something that would place her at increased risk, but you can't find the mutation. So, the answer there is you continue to watch them, you may do surveillance examinations such as a mammogram more often. But you can't declare them as having increased risk at this point. And then, the biggest problem with contemporary genetic testing, in my view, or a big problem, is that sometimes you get patients who have the testing, who don't have a family member who has cancer yet, or you don't have an indexed family member. And the testing results and the detection of a variant that's never been seen before in a gene like BRCA1 or BRCA2. In that setting, you can't say that the genetic variant is likely to increase the risk. You also can't say the genetic variant can simply be completely written off. So those are also patients where there's a heightened surveillance and a heightened sensitivity to the possibility of cancer, but you can't declare that patient as having very high risk of cancer susceptibility. So what happens to people who have BRCA1 mutations? Well, it turns out that patients who have BRCA1 mutations have a very high likelihood of developing breast or ovarian cancer by the time they reach age 70. You can see the likelihood reaches up to 90% in these studies. And the risk starts at age 40 or less for these young women. So remember, Angelina Jolie was 37 at the time she encountered the medical system for this particular problem. Just as a point of reference, the population frequency of breast cancer is around 2% at age 50 and around 7% at age 70. So, these are really dramatic increases in the cancer risk. The other thing to say about patients who have breast cancer and who have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation is that they're at very high risk for having a second cancer develop in the contralateral breast. So those patients need particular surveillance as well. So what do you do with a person like Angelina Jolie who tests positive for a mutation that's previously been associated with cancer. We assume that's what happened to her. So there are really three options and they are very personal. This is an example of personalized medicine where the patient is the personalizer, and the patient decides what they want to have done. Increased surveillance, that means more frequent mammograms and in fact more frequent gynecological examinations, is one option that many women opt for. A second option is prophylactic mastectomy and prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy. And that's another option that many women opt for. And then there is some thought that some medications that have cancer suppressing capabilities like Tamoxifen may be useful in women who choose to go that route. And that's again, a very personal choice, and that's a decision that the woman has to make along with her physician and her family. So the real bottom line is who should get special attention for looking for cancer susceptibility genes. Angelina Jolie's family history is really very, very striking. And so it was very reasonable for her to go and ask the question, should I get genetic testing? There's a lot of controversy around the particular kind of genetic testing she had because there's a controversy about the fact that it's very expensive. And a controversy around the fact that it's licensed by one company who are fighting in the courts with whether they can have exclusivity over that or not. And that's not an area of personalized medicine I choose to discuss in detail here. But faced with a patient, the kinds of clues that give one pause to think, maybe this person should be seen by a family cancer specialist. Who will think about not only BRCA1 and BRCA2, but other genes, less common genes, that can also have mutations that predispose to cancer. Breast cancer at age less than 50, Ashkenazi Jewish women, especially with a history of breast or ovarian cancer. More than one ovarian cancer in the family, breast or ovarian cancer in the family. A man with breast cancer should open that family up for further genetic evaluation. Pancreatic cancer, it also arises from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and more than one pancreatic cancer in the family should lead to an evaluation. Colorectal cancer at age less than 50 and many colon polyps, I'll talk about that in the next module. Some pheochromocytomas are familial and then medullary cancer of the thyroid is another typical cancer that often runs in families and should prompt a referral to a family cancer specialist. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/SHYbI/genomics-to-subtype-cancer","Genomics to Subtype Cancer","[MUSIC] So today what I want to talk about is the way in which genomics is being used to really revolutionize the way people are approaching cancer. Not only in terms of treatment, but in terms of understanding fundamental mechanisms and in terms of the way we, as doctors, classify cancer. And I'll come back to that in a little bit. Let's start with a case. A 63 year old woman with a recent change in a mole on her leg. She's a tanning salon user, she doesn't use sunscreen when she goes outside. An excisional biopsy is done and she has malignant melanoma. Undergoes further evaluation and has multiple liver metastases. This is a really dire situation in which patient's prognosis is pretty grim. And new understanding of the mechanisms in this disease and other diseases is changing that prognosis somewhat and is really giving new insights into how cancer actually works. So before I discuss the management of this patient, let me go back a little bit to a slide that I showed several modules ago discussing mechanisms of genetic variation. This is a slide that illustrates the formation of the Philadelphia chromosome and illustrates the fact that the Philadelphia chromosome, the pathological hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Represents a translocation event between a segment of chromosome 9 and a segment of chromosome 22. That results in a somewhat longer chromosome 9 and a very much shorter and funny looking chromosome 22. The fusion event at chromosome 22 results in the generation of a new gene that's a fusion between ECR and ABL, so that generates a new kinase and that kinase actually drives the development of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The recognition that that kinase was important in the generation of that particular cancer led directly to the development of drugs that would inhibit that kinase activity. The first of those drugs was a drug called Gleevac, and Gleevac turns out to be highly highly, highly effective in chronic myelogenous leukemia not 100% of effective but highly, highly effective. And interestingly also effective in certain unusual form of stomach cancer that appears to be driven by the same mechanism. So that gives us two hints. One hint is that if we understand the driver mechanisms whereby cancer is activated we may be able to develop drugs that inhibit those driver mechanisms. And the second hint is that cancers that we call by different names, cancers that look different under a microscope may actually have very similar molecular mechanisms and therefore maybe treated by the same kinds of drugs, something we hadn't anticipated at all. So the big story around this next comes in the disease malignant melanoma that this patient that I presented to you has. So the traditional way of classifying malignant melanoma is shown here. And it has to do with where the melanoma arises and whether there's evidence that sun damage to the skin plays a role. So does it arise in skin with sun damage? Without sun damage, does it arise in mucosal surfaces in the eye, or in acral surfaces, hands and feet. So that's the traditional way of classifying melanoma. And based on the classification, you would choose particular drug therapies, most of which in the metastatic situation would be relatively ineffective. The ability to sequence not the patient's genome, but the genome of the cancer cells, which is different from the patient's genome, has led to the recognition that melanomas, along with many other cancers, have many, many mutations and, in fact, some of those are driver mutations. How to distinguish driver mutations is an interesting question, but one of the genes that most commonly implicated in melanoma is a gene called BRAF. The lower pie plot shows the kinds of mutations that are discovered when you sequence a melanoma and BRAF mutations are among the most common. And among the BRAF mutations there's one in particular that results in a substitution at a single amino acid position, termed V600E that represents somewhere around 30 to 40% of all melanomas. Now, it turns out that mutant BRAF is also a kinase. And drives the activation and the development of the melanoma. So people naturally went ahead and developed inhibitors of BRAF V600E. So this slide shows that when you subclassify melanoma, not by the way it looks or the way it arises, but what the mutations are, you can identify BRAF mutations in many melanomas, particularly those arising in non-sun damaged skin. But you can see that you have a hint now that melanoma may be better classified by the driver mutation rather than where it arose or what it looks like to the dermatologist. So here is an example of a patient with far, far, far advanced metastatic malignant melanoma. Each one of those nodules is actually a metastatic lesion, and this patient is on death's door. 15 weeks of treatment with a BRAF V600E inhibitor, vemurafenib, results in almost complete clearing of the melanoma. That's an incredibly dramatic response, and it really tells you something, not only about the biology, but the hope that this kind of approach may confer. One of the other things that's interesting about this particular scenario is that there are other cancers in which BRAF V600E also appears to play a role. One of them is a very unusual form of leukemia called hairy cell leukemia. Hairy cell leukemia is called that because when people look at it under the microscope, the leukemic cells look like they have little hairs. So they call it Hairy Cell Leukemia. It's not very informative about what the right treatment is, but when Hairy Cell Leukemia cells are sequenced 100% of them have BRAF V600E. And the bottom slides here just show clinical course of an individual patient with BRAF V600E hairy cell leukemia treated with conventional therapies, including a drug called Cladribine, and the blood counts in the bottom panel show that they are very low, and the drugs are not working. The patient has progressive disease. They're put on if their blood counts recover and that indicates that that's a viable form of therapy in at least that one patient for hairy cell leukemia, as well. And here's another example of a patient with BRAF V600E that happens to be in a thyroid cancer that has now been widely metastatic and spread to the lungs on this CT scan after treatment with the CT scan is almost completely cleared. So there's hope that we can not only use these drugs in specific subtypes of patients who happen to have these kind of mutant kinases. But also we can reclassify cancer to say not that it's thyroid or hairy cell or melanoma, but it's BRAF V600E positive, or Philadelphia chromosome positive, those kinds of classifications that are much more informative for targeted therapies. However, all is not is well-known that most patients who get vemurafenib will have a traumatic response, and then often develop recurrences as this patient did several weeks after this traumatic response. Was also interesting is that patients treated with vemurafenib from melanoma often develop other kinds of skin cancer. Squamous cell cancer. This is an example of a squamous cell cancer. And many of those squamous cell cancers have a particular mutation in their genome, not in the BRAF gene, but actually in a gene called HRAS. So in some way the development, the inhibition of BRAF V600E enables the emergence of other cancer pathways. So this is a problem that people are dealing with. And the notion is that you deal with that BRAF V600E and the cancer somehow escapes either through developing alternate pathways to activation. One of the pathways that is now understood is the so-called MEK pathway, and that pathway in fact can be inhibited by addition of new drugs. And there's this idea now inhibition of BRAP V600E combined with MEK inhibitors may provide a more durable form of therapy in melanoma. So there's hope yet that cancer might turn into one of those diseases like Tuberculosis or HIV that we routinely treat with three or four drugs for long term. And have efficacy when one drug would not work because resistance would emerge. This is the traditional classification for lung cancer. Again, the same thing. Lung cancer is classified as squamous cell cancer, adenocarcinoma, large cell cancer, small cell cancer. But in fact, when you sequence the cancer genome you can see that there are mutations that are driver mutations in a variety of genes shown here. And one of those is the ALK fusion gene and the bottom scans shows the response of a patient with recurrent lung cancer after conventional therapy. You can see the panel on the left shows extensive disease in the left lung, this patient's had a left lower lobectomy as well. That's why the X-ray looks funny. And then, after treatment, after two cycles of a drug called which is an ALK fusion inhibitor, the cancer is cleared. So that holds out great hope for the small number of patients who have ALK fusion-driven cancers and, of course, the real problem is that the yellow slice of the pie is still pretty large, so we still don't understand what drives most cancers. So personalizing medicine in cancer, the bottom lines are, cancer is a disease of the genome, acquired mutations in cancer cells caused this disease, and there's a whole other story that is left tho the specialist oncologist at this point. Identifying mutations and targeting by new drugs can produce traumatic clinical responses, but not in everybody. And those traumatic clinical responses may not be durable in everyone. Clearly, I think, the feels headed in the right direction. And it's going to be very exciting to watch how this in the application of genomic technologies to cancer will allow personalizing therapies and better [INAUDIBLE]. [SOUND] [SOUND] >> [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/df8tp/personalizing-care-in-diabetes","Personalizing Care in Diabetes","[MUSIC] So in this module I'm going to continue the theme of focusing on a particular condition and exploring the genetic and molecular basis of the disease and responses to treatment. And the condition today is diabetes. Diabetes is an enormous problem worldwide. It's linked to obesity, but not everybody who is fat gets diabetes and not everybody who has diabetes gets fat. There are two types recognized. We all know that, type one and type two diabetes, and one of the lessons I'll try to teach today is that there are probably many, many other subtypes. Genetics have helped define some of those other subtypes and some of the genetic subtypes which appear to be relatively unusual right now have clear implications for therapy. And what's really interesting is that the type one and type two diabetics who behave clinically quite differently appear to have, from genome-wide association studies, from candidate gene studies, and from many, many other perspectives, very different disease mechanisms. And GWAS has actually helped illuminate some of the potential disease pathways that lead to these diseases. I'm going to start by telling you a case. And I'm not going to give you the answer until later in this module. A 16 year boy discovered incidentally to have elevated blood glucose. He is not overweight. One of the issues in dealing with a 16 year old is that that's the age where he could have type one diabetes. And it's the age where he could have type two diabetes, particularly as an evolving threat in the young who are overweight. He is not overweight, he relates a positive family history of diabetes, which is very common in type one diabetes, but his blood sugar is modestly elevated. And we'll come back to the rest of the story in a moment. Diabetes an extraordinarily common disease. There are hundreds of millions of people who carry the diagnosis. And there are probably a further couple of hundred million people who have the disease, who have not yet acquired the diagnosis. The vast, vast majority of those people have type two diabetes. Type one diabetes probably affects something like 10 million people across the world. Type two diabetes, hundreds of millions of people. Let's look at type one diabetes first. When you look at prevalence by country, well what's really quite interesting is that this is a northern European disease. Type one diabetes can occur in many, many other parts of the world, presenting classically in the young with very high blood sugars and ketoacidosis even. But that seems to be particularly prevalent in Scandinavia and other parts of Northern Europe. Even before the advent of genome-wide association studies, there was a clear association with variation in the MHC region, which controls immunity. So there was this sense that diabetes might be an autoimmune disease. What this slide shows is the effect of many, many genes that have been discovered as a predisposition alleles to diabetes. The ones in gray have been discovered by GWAS. The ones in red were discovered prior to GWAS, you can see the much larger signals from, for example, the MHC locus detected as early as the 1970s. And the y-axis here is the risk that you will get diabetes if you have a sibling with diabetes. So again this idea of familial transmission. When people started to look at genome-wide association studies, for example you can find loci on these chromosomes, and many, many others by now, that confer risk for type one diabetes. And what's interesting is the MHC locus on chromosome six carries an odds ratio of less than 10 to the minus 200th. So it's really a very, very important signal. The LOD score is like the odds ratio, it's the logarithm of the odds ratio, and this is a metric derived from family studies mainly. So I want to make a little digression here and talk about the relationship between type one diabetes as an autoimmune disease and other autoimmune diseases. So listed here are a couple of dozen loci where variation increases risk for type one diabetes. They tend to be in to be in immune signalling genes. And what's interesting is that the same variants, or at least the same loci, perhaps not the same exact variants of those genes, also confer risk for many, many other autoimmune diseases. Celiac disease notably, multiple sclerosis, MS, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn's disease. So that's an interesting overlap that suggests that an immune diathesis can result in a variety of manifestations across diseases. There's a little bit of data. It's not very compelling. The patients, for example, with Crohn's disease, do they have a higher incidence of type one diabetes? Some say yes, some say no. Celiac disease, there's a much stronger association. Let me just digress a little bit more and talk about inflammatory bowel disease. So there have been very large genome-wide association studies looking at Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Conditions that sometimes can be difficult to tell apart, but when you look at the genome-wide association signals, they tend to be in three categories. Crohn's specific, ulcerative colitis specific or overlap the inflammatory bowel disease syndromes overlap. The overlap tend to be an immune signaling in HLA, the ulcerative colitis variants tend to be in genes that are barrier functions. So those are suggested that there's something trying to get in or that the epithelium is leaky in some way. And that's a proximate contributor to the ulcerative colitis phenotype. For Crohn's there is a real problem with innate immunity. And so that suggests that there are very different pathways that make the bowel respond in a different way when manifesting with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis in the face of multiple exogenous stresses, as well as genetic predisposition. And one more slide about inflammatory bowel disease, again this idea of these immune diseases having overlaps at the genetic level with many other immune diseases as shown here. So, all inflammatory bowel disease is linked together and is linked to type one and type two diabetes, shown at the bottom of these slides as well is celiac disease and many, many other autoimmune conditions. And the genes that highlight those overlaps are shown here. So that's the story with type one diabetes is that it appears to be an autoimmune disease. Of course there are people who are very interested in immune modulators as early interventions in patients who have just been diagnosed or who are just about to be diagnosed with type one diabetes. A very exciting area of investigation, but again, the big problem worldwide is type two diabetes. This is the prevalence of type two diabetes expressed as a percentage of the population of that country. And as part of the obesity epidemic, the United States leads the world. Probably related to obesity, but that's percentage of the population of the country. And in fact we don't lead the world. The world is led by China and India. Where the prevalence is somewhat lower, but the total population is obviously much, much higher. And so the emerging threat from Type 2 diabetes actually continues to be in the United States and somewhat in western Europe, but the big, big threat is going to come from Asia, the big threat to human health. I've shown you slides of association studies looking at diabetes or insulin sensitivity before and I highlighted in one of the earlier modules, SLC 30A8 as one of the many many signals and remember it's indicated by that red arrow on this slide. Remember that rare variation in that gene appears to protect against diabetes, at least in certain parts of the world like Iceland. And so that highlights the idea that even these modest effects sizes out of a gwASK can be clues to genetic variation that can be actually drivers for the development of new drug therapy. So if you have an inhibitor of SLC 30A8 function, you may have a drug that could prevent Type 2 diabetes as I discussed in one of the earlier modules. The other part that's really interesting about the GWAS in results in Type 2 diabetes is where the genes are. So if you had asked a diabetes researcher 20 years ago or 15 years ago, what is a fundamental defect in type two diabetes? The answer would probably be that the pancreas works just fine, secretes insulin, but those people are too fat and they have much high insulin requirements than normal. And because they have much higher insulin requirements than normal, the pancreas just sort of gets exhausted. And it turns out, at least from the gwASK data, that that explanation is probably not the whole story, and probably not in the correct direction. Most of the genes that have been identified by gwASK as conferring a predisposition to Type 2 diabetes actually are involved in insulin secretion. Not in insulin sensitivity, and some are involved in cell cycles. So the notion is that it's the beta cell mass, how many beta cells you have, and how well they are able to secrete insulin, that is the fundamental problem in Type 2 diabetes, not this idea that the end organs are gobbling it up. So that's an interesting way of thinking about it, and it makes people think differently in terms of therapeutic approaches. So come back to his boy because he seems a little unusual. And when I say a positive family history of diabetes, here's the family history. And this works like and autosomal dominant disease, with pretty high penitrants. Involves men and women, it involves many generations, it involves male to female and female to male transmission. The proband is the square on the lower right, and you can see that his mother and his maternal grandfather have diabetes and his uncle and his cousin. So what's the problem here? This is probably an example of what's called maturity onset diabetes in the young. Maturity onset diabetes being another name for Type 2 diabetes. But maturity onset diabetes in the young, MODY, M-O-D-Y. And the fundamental problem in MODY is shown on this slide. There have been now six genes in which mutations have been identified in families, such as the one I just showed you. One of the disease genes, one of the first ones discovered, is in glucokinase. Glucokinase plays a central role in beta cell functions. This is a cartoon of a beta cell and what glucokinase does is it adds a phosphate group to glucose, and that in turn results in generation of ATP, generation of ATP closes ATP sensitive. Potassium channel shown in the lower right, when they are close, the membrane depolarized and the calcium channel open and calcium entry into the cells allows insulin secretion to occur. So if you have high glucose, you have normal glucokinase activity, you get, you make Glucose 6 phosphate, that in turn results in an insulin secretion. So the cell has a way of sensing what's going on in it's outside and responding by insulin secretion. The problem in the first form of maturity onset diabetes in the MODY is loss of function variant in glucokinase. So they have decreased ability to do that sensing and therefore decreased ability to secrete insulin. And the other five genes that have been identified in families with MODY all have to do with insulin synthesis. They're all transcription factors that control insulin synthesis. So the problem in this disease is that there's just not enough insulin being secreted in response to a glucose load. The disease tends to be very, very mild. So it's important to recognize these people don't, and mild means a good long, long term prognosis. And they don't need insulin, actually, they can be managed with oral medicines. And, occasionally, oral medicines are actually the treatment of choice for these particular patients. Not surprisingly, there are rare, rare cases of families in which a child inherits an abnormal glucokinase allele from both parents. This is a family that was originally reported In 2001. And you can see the affected individual in blue, in the lower right, has two abnormal alleles, one from mom and one from dad, and mom and dad, as you can see, are first cousins. So that's the reason that a rare variant can be transmitted to a child. And that child presented with severe diabetes as a neonate. It's important to recognize that because those children do need insulin right away because they just don't have an ability to secrete insulin at all, they present with pretty profound hyperglycemia. So let me come back to this idea of the interplay between the ATP sensitive potassium channel and the calcium channel, because I have a different story to tell you. So again, the cartoon on the left side shows the normal function. There's potassium inside the cells, potassium outside the cells, and when ATP levels are low, the channels is open. When the channel opens, potassium flows out. And when ATP levels rise the channel closes, so it's an ATP inhibited channel. The channel closes, potassium no longer flows out, membrane depolarizes, calcium enters the cell, and that results insulin secretion. That's the way the things normally worked. Now, if you at this cartoon you wondered to yourself, could there be mutations in the genes that encode the ATP sensitive potassium channel itself. Of course I wouldn't be telling you this story if that wasn't the case. The ATP sensitive potassium channel, you can see in the cartoon, has a blue core, and an orange coating around the core. The blue core are the potassium channels. And there are four proteins that make up one potassium channel. And the orange coat is a sub unit that goes around the potassium channels to regulate their function. So what happens in a person who has A mutation in the ATP sensitive potassium channel, is that the channel is open and it refuses to close. And when it refuses to close, the signal to tell people to secrete insulin, the signal through the calcium channel, is no longer there. So insulin is not secreted and the patient is hyperglycemic. Interestingly, I didn't tell you the name of the subunit of the potassium channel. So the orange coating around the potassium channel is called SUR1, and that stands for sulfonylurea receptor 1, and that is the specific target of the sulfonylurea class of drugs. You give the sulfonylurea's and you specifically correct this defect. So this so-called gain of function defect in SUR, and there are also mutations reported in the potassium channel, can be specifically reversed and managed by the administration of sulfonylurea drugs. These are patients who have hyperglycemia, they do not need insulin. What they need is a drug that corrects the fundamental defect, the fundamental defect here being a channel that doesn't close appropriately in response to high blood sugar. So here is a cartoon of the channel. I told you there is four potassium channel proteins that assemble together to make the little pore through which potassium flows. And then there's this outer coating called the sulfonylurea receptor that channels, and the name of the channel is KIR6.1 and the name of the sulfonylurea receptor gene is SUR1. And gain-of-function mutations, in either the SUR1 or the potassium channel gene, result in diabetes. Loss-of-function variance do the exact opposite. And loss-of-function variance results in profound neonatal hypoglycemia. Because they have too much insulin secretion. So this is an example, again, where understanding the molecular basis of the disease leads to direct therapies. The hypoglycemic patients could be managed by drugs that activate the channel complex. The most commonly used is a drug called Diazoxide which in normal individuals, [COUGH] is an anti-hypertensive with a side effect of increase in blood sugar. But of course in this instance you want it to increase blood sugar. So I told you before, the prevalence of type ii diabetes is enormous around the world. The drug of first choice is metformin. And there is a little bit of data that suggests that variability and response in metformin is also genetically driven. So here is one example. This is a group of normal subjects who were given a glucose load and blood sugars were followed over time on the left hand panel in the absence of metformin. There are two groups of subjects. These are normal subjects. One who have wild-type OCT1. OCT1 is a transporter. That is responsible for moving metformin out of the blood, into the liver cell, which is where it does its work. And the other group are people who have lost a function variant in oft one. So there in the absence of drug, they look exactly the same. They have the same response to glucose load. But you then give them metformin and perform the glucose load again. In the presence of metformin and the transporter that will suck the drug up into the liver and allow it to work, blood glucose is lowered. That's the black dots. But in the presence of a variant in opt one you can see that the metformin effect is much less prominent. And those patients look like they're not taking any drug at all. So this transporter, polymorphism, is one explanation for variability in response to metformin and there other genetic variants that are now being described that contribute to variability in metformin effects. Again, what does all this have to do with personalizing medicine in diabetes and across medicine? Okay once again I keep on coming back to this message understanding the mechanisms of disease allows you to personalize therapy. So type 1, type 2 diabetes that 's an important distinction. But there are other sub-types that are pretty rare right now, but hopefully will become more common. Which will have specific therapies attached to them. There is variability in this response to commonly used treatments and genetics does play a role. We recognize type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Those classifications are almost certainly over simplifications. And an interesting challenge that we have now is not simply to identify who is going to get diabetes. That's actually pretty difficult, and you would think that understanding the genetics of the disease could allow you to use genetics to identify patients ahead of time. But the genetics don't contribute enough to risk to allow us to do that. The real challenge in clinical medicine right now, is to identify the hundreds of millions of patients around the world who have diabetes, who are suffering the vascular complications of diabetes, and don't yet know it. So that's going to be an interesting public health challenge that has everything to do with personalizing medicine and not much to do with genetics. [INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC] [SOUND] [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/W5JXY/personalizing-care-in-neuropsychiatric-disease","Personalizing Care in Neuropsychiatric Disease","[MUSIC] Today I'm going to start on a series of modules that discuss the genetic and other ways of personalizing therapy in a variety of therapeutic areas. So what I want to talk about is the way in which we understand the molecular genetic basis of disease, how those diseases respond to therapy, how we make diagnoses of those diseases using modern molecular tools, and how the treatments that we use can either be effective or cause side effects, and how we're understanding the molecular and genetic predictors of those kinds of outcomes. So the first area that I want to talk about is neuropsychiatric disease. Neuropsychiatric disease extracts a huge toll on people worldwide. These are two maps that show the impact of schizophrenia and unipolar depression measured as disability. So not prevalence, not how many people have the disease, and not how many people get the disease per year incidents, but actually what the impact of the disease is on those people. So Unipolar depression, a huge problem in the United States, huge problem in India and Western Europe. Schizophrenia, a problem worldwide including South America, Africa, and across Asia. So these are problems that are there. There's no question that there's a familial risk factor. So if you have a family member with schizophrenia or with depression you're at increased risk. So we think that there's a genetic story behind that. What is important to know is that it really affects people worldwide. Schizophrenia, around 0.5 % of people at some point in their life will be affected by Schizophrenia. Depression varies from country to country. 3% in Japan, up to 17% in the United States. An average of about 10% of patients at any given time have depression, so prevalence is about 10%. And in North America, in Canada, or the Unites States the probability of having a major depressive episode during any particular year is about 4% for men and about 8 to 10% for women. So these are enormous problems, and one of the issues is that the therapies that we have are effective in individual subjects, but there are many therapies that are ineffective in many subjects, so you don't know when you start treatment which treatment is going to be best for which patient. So, one question is, given the familial nature of these diseases, can we identify genes that are actually causative, or at least increase susceptibility. This is a genome-wide association study you're used to looking at these kinds of Manhattan plots now. This is a pretty dirty Manhattan plot and when you look at the Y access, none of those p-values are very, very, very low. There are many, many low psi in a huge number of cases suggest is that there are going to be genetic risk factors. They're going to carry very, very, modest odds ratios. Odds ratios are 1.1, 1.2 each, and the way in which they interact and which they drive the development of the disease Is something that GWAS, as I've said before and I will say again, GWAS is a first step to understanding fundamental disease mechanisms. So that's what this does, but it doesn't tell us anything about predicting disease in an individual subject. What is interesting, and what is really an emerging theme in neuropsychiatry, especially is a problem called copy number variation. Now the slide on the, the panel on the left shows a scan across a particular region of the chromosome, and each dot and there are many, many, many, many dots, illustrates the abundance of a particular gene or genetic region using snips, in fact, as the caller. So, in fact, when you look at the parents, the bottom two panels for these two particular regions that are being scanned they're all blue lines, and that means the parents have two copies of all the DNA that's being interrogated, when you look at the child, the child have blue lines all the way, but there's two places where there's less DNA. And the amount of DNA is decreased by 50%. So what that says is that in those stretches of DNA there's a big chunk, not a snip, not a couple of nucleotides, but hundreds, perhaps thousands of nucleotides that have just been deleted. And you can see because you understand the parents and child on this slide. You can see that these are both de novo changes, that is they occur in the child, but they do not occur in the parents. So if you look for de novo copy number variation, this is called copy number number variation, you can find a markedly increased incidence of copy number variation amongst schizophrenics, but what's really interesting is that you find a very, very high Incidence of copy number variation in autism. That's the red bars on the right. And so there's a lot of excitement about the idea that copy number variants, things that are difficult to assess using conventional technologies, may be a contributor to these diseases, and that would be an important step in terms of understanding their fundamental mechanism. Of course, if you have a copy number variation that stretches over thousands of base pairs, you are disrupting the function of many, many genes. So the way in which copy number variant produced the phenotypes that we're interested in, and those phenotypes appear to be largely, neuropsychiatric genotypes to-date, although there's not been a focus on copy variation in other diseases. It remains to be determined. So this is a big clue to a different pathway to understanding disease. At the other end of the spectrum is the idea of using next generation sequencing to understand rare diseases. This is a famous case that was reported a couple of years ago in science. There is a pair of fraternal twins that are indicated in black, so you can tell they're twins because they have that funny symbol on the family tree that they come from the same place, and they're a boy and a girl, so they have to be fraternal twins. They're both affected, and you can see there's the mutations that they have are actually listed underneath them. And they are, it turns out compound heterozygotes for rare variants in a particular gene that I'm going to tell you about now. They inherit one copy from the mother who's phenotypically normal, one copy from the father. And they have a disease which really resulted in severe movement disorders and severe intellectual disabilities. And so those are the kinds of problems that are really, really difficult to deal with. The fact that they both had it suggested that there might be a genetic basis. So using the kinds of approaches in next generation sequencing that I've talked about before, you sequence the effected children and you actually sequence the parents. And you come up with millions and millions of variants across the whole genome, but using filtering such as how many of them are encoding regions, who many of them are rare, how many of them have been seen before, how many of them are in places where you think you a mutation might cause a disease. You come up with a very, very small number of candidate genes, and actually it turns out that there's one candidate gene in these two individuals. Because what you're looking for here is two rare variants, one on one allele and one on the other allele. So, in these two children there was only one, and it was discovered in a gene called SPR. SPR is a critical step In the genesis, in the generation of Tetrahydrobioprotein is shown on this slide, and so when you have that in ways that we don't completely understand results in phenotype these children had. What was really interesting is that you can actually reverse the disease as you can see on this path way on the left lower side by administering L dopa. So these children, based on this genetic diagnosis, were given L dopa treatment, and have had dramatic intellectual and functional recoveries. So this is, going from a population, going from very large segments of genome deleted in diseases like autism, to a very specific set of genetic variants in a rare condition that offers a direct pathway to a treatment. So we have the spectrum in neuropsychiatry just like we do in other domains of medicine. I've shown you this slide before, just highlighting the idea that CYP2D6 genotype has a major affect on the doses that are required to treat with various antidepressants, depending on whether you're a poor metabolizer, an intermediate metabolizer, extensive, or ultra rapid metabolizer. And I've shown you this slide, the same idea for CYP2C19. This is another example, this is, one of the major effectors of neuropsychiatric function is serotonin in the cleft in between two neurons, and what controls serotonin concentration there largely Is a molecule called the serotonin transporter. The serotonin transporter gene is, the cartoon of its structure is shown on the top of the slide. And what's interesting is in the promoter region, the region of the gene that doesn't encode the protein, but actually controls how much of that protein you make, or is one of the major controllers of how much of that protein you make, has a common polymorphism is in it. The common polymorphism is called short or long. Short is a shorter version and makes less messenger RNA, less protein. The long makes more messenger RNA, and more protein. So people have asked the question, well if you have more serotonin transporter, does that mean you respond better to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs, which are drugs like fluoxetine or paroxetine, very commonly used antidepressants? And the answer is maybe. So, all the dots to the right of this slide suggest in a trial, that the effect is better in people with, it's labeled here L/L, but it means, I'm sorry it's labeled II on the graph, but it's actually the long, long version. So those patients tend to respond better. So the way these graphs are displayed is that the mean affect in particular trial is the dot, the size of the trial is the size of the dot, and where their confidence intervals are shown, and where the confidence intervals intersect the vertical line, that means there's no statistically detectable effect. And so you can look at this kind of slide and you can see the results in ten different studies, mostly go to the right but on average there's not a big, big effect. So this an interesting observation, and whether you come away from this with the idea that this variant in some way affects SSRI response or not, depends on whether you're a genetic optimistic or not. But I think if, at best you can say that there's a very, very small signal. And of course there are some small studies that go in the opposite direction. There's some medium sized studies that go in no direction. On the other hand, there's a recent study that looked at response to Lithium, commonly used drug in bipolar disorder. And you're used to looking at genome-wide association studies now. This is a spectacular result with a p-value less than 10 to the minus 32. In a very small cohort of patients, 294 patients, treated with Lithium and then assessed on the basis of responders or nonresponders. The odds ratio for this signal is 112, and when they looked at the underlying genes at the particular locus the GADL1 gene was the candidate and resequencing identified a relatively uncommon snip that results in altered splicing of that particular gene. So this signal may all be related to GADL1 in ways that people don't completely understand. What's really quite interesting is reading the letters after this particular paper came out, and there is a number of groups around the world who have tried to replicate this and have been unable to. So you have a GWAS that shows a huge, highly statistically significant result, and yet others cannot replicate it. Of course, if others replicate it, then this would be an incredibly interesting important marker for driving selection of therapies in this disorder. If they don't replicate it, then we have to argue about why this signal came up in the first place. One possibility is the phenotype, what is it that you, how do you define response to lithium? Some people define it one way, some people define it another way. And it depends a little bit on the definition of the response phenotype. So, this is a signal that is very exciting, very new, and remains to be seen whether it can be implemented in clinical medicine or not. Clozepine is a widely used antipsychotic. It's highly effective thought to be one of the most effective antipsychotics we have. And the problem is, that it causes agranulocytosis which is a really, really feared side effect and can be fatal. It's never the drug of first choice because of that, and its use requires pretty frequent monitoring to detect agranulocytosis should it start to develop. What's interesting is that there's a pretty important, pretty impressive signal in the HLA locasis. It's not like some of the other signals I've shown you. It's not, the odds ration isn't 100. It's 17. But yet it does suggest that we could eventually develop a mechanism to identify subjects at particularly high risk for agranulocytosis and not use the drug under any circumstances. And then the rest of the population would still probably have to be surveyed, but you'd do that with the understanding that you probably have reduced the risk of this adverse event. Among antipsychotics right now, there's so called second generation anti-psychotic, which are highly effective and less toxic than initial drugs that were developed in the 1960s and 70s. Here is a set of drugs, and one of the side effects of these agents is weight gain. And it's particularly marked with a drug called Olanzapine where there's actually a reported increased incidence of diabetes. So, and each one of these drugs has other kinds of side effects so olanzapine still is one of the most widely used drugs, relatively well-tolerated except for this side effect, and what's interesting is that not everybody gains weight, but on average, people gain almost ten kilos. That's almost an enormous amount of weight, especially in patients with schizophrenia because the problem with schizophrenia, one problem with schizophrenia is that patients with that disease, which is a really devastating disease, tend to have a much higher incidence of, a much higher prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. They're sedentary, they're overweight to start with. And after olanzapine, they're more overweight. There is an increased incidence of hypertension, diabetes, and there's a very high incidence of smoking. So this is an undesirable side effect for many, many reasons. And what's interesting, to me at least, is when you start to do a GWAS on weight gain during olanzapine treatment in children, you get a very nice signal, and that signal is very close to a gene called MC4R. MC4R, rare variants in MC4R, are now known to be a cause of obesity, particularly in children. So you have this idea that there may be variation in this gene that doesn't necessarily cause obesity, but predisposes patients to much more weight gain during a stress like the administration of a drug that causes weight gain like Olanzapine. So whether, in fact, we can go from this kind of result, to screening patients at risk for massive weight gain during this drug remains to be seen. But this is an interesting signal in the right direction. So I've shown you this slide before, and I thought I would come back to this idea again, because over the last ten minutes or so I've shown you examples of very, very large signals that are associated with clear phenotypes, a rare variant in SPR that causes a dopa-responsive disease. That's very, very rare. Copy number variants that appear to be drivers of autism, and a variation that results in variability in lithium outcomes. On the other hand, the SIP2C19 and SIP2D6 stories that I've shown you before, particularly with drugs like, anti-depressant drugs like Venlafaxine shown here, the signals are much, much more modest. And so you have to ask yourself as we implement genomic medicine, are we going to focus on rare patients who have really extreme phenotypes and identifiable genetic variants that will be rare that actually could be actionable, or are we going to focus on large populations of patients with relatively common variation, and how we're going to manage delivering this kind of information to the healthcare system is going to be another challenge? So in summary, we have in the neuropsychiatric area, we have clear genetic susceptibility to disease and in drug response. Some markers have modest affect size. Others are very large, and may be clinically useful. And as I've said before, and as I will say again, understanding underlying pathways discovered through genomic and other mechanisms continue to provide insights into underlying disease mechanisms, and hopefully to new and targeted and effective drug therapies.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/CpJFT/a-case-of-idiopathic-heart-failure","A Case of Idiopathic Heart Failure","[MUSIC] Today, I want to talk about the problem of idiopathic heart failure, and I will telegraph one of my main messages, is that I absolutely despise the word idiopathic. The reason I don't like it is that I think idiopathic is a word we use when we have no idea what's going on and we're not really interested in finding out what's going on. So people have said, when somebody calls a disease idiopathic, it's sort of idiotic on the part of the doctor and pathetic on the part of the patient and I sort of agree with that as well. So let me go through this case and the main message is don't say idiopathic. And as I'll discuss, there's this problem that is emerging as we get better and better at sequencing, we find things and we don't know what to do with them in the genome. And we'll come back to that in a bit. So the story I want to frame this a 32 year old man who comes in with a three week history of gradually increasing shortness of breath and ankle swelling. His cardiogram shows, as is typical in many of these cases, left bundle branch block and sinus rhythm otherwise. And an echocardiogram is done and it shows four chamber dilatation and thinning. I don't have the movie, but there's no regional wall motion abnormality. And as is sometimes the case in this particular patient, there's an obvious, very large clot at the left ventricular apex, you can see that indicated by the arrows. So these patients are susceptible to serious arrhythmias, they clearly present with heart failure as this patient did and they're susceptible to the thromboembolic complications through the mechanism that you can see on this slide. So when we see somebody who has what we call dilated cardiomyopathy, that's what this is. We divide them traditionally into ischemic and non-ischemic causes. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is probably the commonest cause of cardiomyopathy. It's in patients who generally are known to have advanced coronary disease or who have some condition, usually diabetes, that prevents them from having symptoms of coronary occlusions and they present after having had several infarcts. With ischemic cardiomyopathy, the hallmark of that is regional wall motion abnormalities, often in the territory of the major coronary arteries. This man is too young for that, has no history for that and he has non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and the common causes are listed here. The commonest cause in the United States is almost certainly burned out hypertension, which this man does not have. It's traditional to say when you don't know the mechanism to say that maybe this patient has had a recent viral infection and it's affected the heart, so viral myocarditis or post viral myocarditis. A number of other causes, excessive alcohol intake in some patients. HIV can do this, there's a syndrome of partum cardiomyopathy, which may have an overlap with the genetic causes that I'll talk about in a moment. A number of drugs and toxins can do this, notably certain anti cancer agents can result in dilated cardiomyopathy well, after therapy. There's this idiopathic term, which again, I told you I despise. And then usually on these lists at least until recently, there was this other category of familial. Often the bottom of the list, often in lighter type. Often in smaller type, just like here. So heres this patient, and if you take a family history in a patient like this, it's not unusual and this happened in this patient, to find other people who have what appears to be symptoms that could be consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy. So in this particular case, theres a great uncle who died suddenly at the age of 25, and there's a distant cousin, or I guess that's a cousin, who had a heart transplant. So those are the kinds of things that people with this particular disease end up having. It turns out that if you do linkage analysis in these families, like large families, like this one or you look at candidate genes, you can now identify dozens of genetic variance that track with dilated cardiomyopathy in families. So there are clear genetic causes for the familial forms, and there's a real strong sense that some of those overlap with the other forms. So perhaps, the alcoholic cardiomyopathy only manifests itself In a patient who has one of these mutations, the peripartum cardiomyopathy, the same idea. So on this slide, you can see in the middle is dilated cardiomyopathy. And there are many, many genes that are attached to dilated cardiomyopathy, but there are other cardiovascular diseases on here. Notably, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and you could see that there's a separate set of genes in which mutations cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but some of them there's an overlap. So, some patients will have either dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. There's this other disease called arrhythmogenic ventricular dysplasia. And again, there's this overlap syndrome. There are diseases of ion channels, I've talked about some of those in the long QT syndrome, and one of those disease genes is the sodium channel gene, SCN5A. Mutations in SCN5A cause a diverse set of diseases, including in some unusual instances, dilated cardiomyopathy and then there's neuromuscular diseases like muscular dystrophy. One of the major causes of death in patients with muscular dystrophy is dilated cardiomyopathy. So you can see there is this overlapped set of syndromes, so some of the genes will produced dilated cardiomyopathy alone, others will produce a variety of phenotypes and we don't understand why some people have one phenotype in and not the other. But it's pretty clear that there's lots and lots of genetic causes across multiple families of genes. So the families of genes are shown here. The three cells in the middle are three generic cardiomyocytes connected end to end as they typically are. And in panel A, you can see the T tubular structure and genes that control calcium cycling, for instance, IRYRY02. Mutations in those will cause arrhythmias and sometimes cardiomyopathy, genes that contribute to the structure of the sarcomere in panels B and C. The contractile apparatus in these cells, mutations in them will cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy. In panel D at the upper right, you can see blown up the cell to cell connection and it turns out that this disease called arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and more commonly arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy arises from problems in the proteins that connect two cells to each other. And there are sort of four or five of those where mutations can cause the disease, then there is a class of genes that are expressed at the nuclear envelope protein, notably a gene called lamin A/C. And one of the manifestations of mutations in lamin A/C is cardiomyopathy, there are a number of others. And then finally, there's mutations in genes that connect the cardiomyocyte to the extracellular matrix and those are also causes of cardiomyopathy. So many, many different causes through many molecular mechanisms. And the hope, of course is by identifying the molecular mechanisms, we'll be on the way to specific drug therapies for each of these subtypes. So, it becomes interesting and important to start to classify these by mutation type and mutation function. So here's the problem, that's the framework, but I wanted to use the problem of dilated cardiomyopathy to illustrate an interesting emerging problem in our field. There are many large cohorts of patients that have been followed for many, many years in the United States. Two of them are shown on this slide. The Framingham Heart Study, which is centered in Framingham, Massachusetts just outside Boston, and the Jackson Heart Study Center in Jackson, Mississippi. Framingham's a cohort that started out with about 6,000 Caucasians in Framingham and is now into its third generation. So about 5 or 6,000 people per generation, it's been going on for decades. Jackson Heart Study's a little younger, focused primarily on African Americans. So here's an interesting experiment that was done in these two resources. 3,600 subjects, African American and Caucasian, had 8 disease genes for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy sequenced. Using next generation sequencing that I've talked about before and 11% of them have rare non-synonymous variance in those genes. So, one in 10 people caries a variant in one of those eight genes. Now the problem is we all recognize that some of those variants are benign, and there are computer based methods and other methods to try to tease out whether they're benign or malignant. So when you use the strictest of criteria, 0.6% are likely pathogenic. So that reduces the number of people who may carry a real pathogenic diseased gene to a very, very small number. So here's the kicker. If you look at 22 subjects who are discovered incidentally in these communities to carry rare, probably pathogenic mutations in these eight disease genes, four of them have evidence of cardiomyopathy. That means that there are 18 out of the 22 who genetic testing has identified as having a disease. They don't have the clinical disease, but they have all the genetics around the disease, including a high likelihood of pathogenic mutation. And yet they don't have the disease. And what's more interesting is that if you look at those patients over long periods of time, because remember these are community studies. So you can follow them for many years. Those patients that carry those variance appear to have an increase cardiovascular risk with an odds ratio that's modest around two, but it still suggests this. So maybe they don't have dilated cardiomyopathy in its full blown form, but maybe they have a little bit of that and a little bit of that is enough to impair survival. So that's one sort of question that we're going to be left with as we start to sequence lots and lots of people and here's another part. So I've showed you this slide before and if you'll look in the corner, the commonest genes that cause dilated cardiomyopathy or the commonest genes in which mutations cause dilated cardiomyopathy are TNNT2, MYH7, MYH6 and then this gene called TTN. And notice TTN causes 25% of all cases of dilated cardiomyopathy. Well, where does that evidence come from? So TTN stands for Titin, T-I-T-I-N. I often think it should be called Titan, T-I-T-A-N, because it is the largest gene in the genome. It has 325 exons and encodes an extraordinarily large protein. And the function of that protein is shown here. It's part of the apparatus that holds together the sarcomere. You see those two spring like structures that are labeled Titins. So that's what Titin does, it sort of holds the whole mess together. And because it is so large, it became pretty daunting to think about how to screen that gene for variants that might be associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. It's just technically a real challenge to do that. But with the advent of next generation sequencing, it became possible to ask the question, could variance in Titin be associated with dilated cardiomyopathy? Notice I didn't say cause, I said be associated with. So here are the data. When you look at a group of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, about 25% of them have variants in Titin that you would predict will disrupt function. So these aren't just missense variants that change a single amino acid. These are variants that disrupt splicing, or these are variants that result in premature truncation of the protein. [COUGH] And when you look at a control group of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a different disease we think, it's a little bit of overlap, those kinds of variants are very rare. What's interesting Is if you look at just a group of normal controls, people off the street. There is a frequency of about 3% of these predicted to be highly deleterious mutations. Now this doesn't count the missense mutations, the snip in Titin, because Titin is so big and we carry snips every 1,000 or 2,000 nucleotides in our DNA. Every single person on average has a missense mutation in Titin. So obviously, most of those don't do anything to function. But the real question is not whether Titin causes dilated cardiomyopathy, I think these data argue pretty strongly that having a mutation, a rare variant in Titin that's predicted to disrupt function, really carries a very high risk of being associated with dilated cardiomyopathy. But 3% of the population out there, walking around on the street without any evidence of the disease, also have those kinds of variance. So let me just close by saying, first of all, my categorization has changed and I put familial at the top of the list, not at the bottom. I put it in bigger type not littler type and I put it in bold, because I think it's one of the leading causes of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. When we see a patient who is young, who presents like this, who hasn't had a real recent galloping viral illness, who doesn't have HIV, who doesn't have anything else and often they don't. They have familial or genetic dilated cardiomyopathy, unless we can find some other cause. So that's the first lesson and the second lesson I think is that we all have rare variants. And those rare variants sometimes would be predicted by every computer algorithm you can could up with to actually disrupt function of that gene. And why it is that we actually have lots and lots of variants and in fact don't have diseases is really, really interesting question. But as we come to an age where people are going to have genome sequenced at birth or when they start a job or whatever, we're going to discover that people have lots of variants. And the challenge to the field will be to figure out which of those variants absolutely need to be followed up. Which of those variants might be important and which of the variants, and we hope that most of them, can be ignored. >> [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/maqJW/marfan-syndrome","Marfan Syndrome","[MUSIC] Today, we're going to talk about Marfan syndrome. An interesting, relatively rare condition that really illustrates the power of understanding mechanisms to go to therapy. So the problem in Marfan syndrome, I've already shown you this picture before, is this unusual body habitus. This is four members of a family from three different generations. You can see that they're all tall, skinny, and they have these very, very long arms with very long fingers. This is an autosomal dominant condition and its been recognized for decades and decades, in fact more than 100 years. So the inheritance is well understood, and we'll come back to genetics in a moment. The clinical features are kind of interesting. It's not just a skeletal problem, but you can see that there's tremendous problems with the bony structure and the hands, they're double jointed, so to speak. And there's curvature of the spine scoliosis, and they also characteristically have a problem with the lens of the eye, and ectopic lens placement, and difficulty with vision. But the biggest problem is in the aorta. You see the chest X-ray shows a pretty widened mediastinum. And the CT scan shows a dissection, that what you see there is FL, which is a false lumen, and a flap in the aorta. So what has happened is the aortic wall has ruptured, and the blood is actually in a false lumen, not in the true lumen. The photo micrograph shows the underlying pathology, and that is the aortic wall has been ruptured. So, this is the most feared complication of Marfan syndrome, because it can result in sudden death. Perhaps, the most recent, famous example was Flo Hyman, arguably the best volleyball player the United States has ever produced. A tall woman with long arms, but none of the other feature of Marfan syndrome and that's pretty typical, not everybody has all the features, and she died suddenly. The death was attributed initially to coronary disease, until the autopsy showed that she had died of a ruptured aneurism of her ascending aorta, which is the typical place. The other person who you will occasionally hear who had Marfan syndrome, was Abraham Lincoln. He was very tall, especially for his time, and had part of the body habitus of Marfan syndrome. So he may in fact have been a carrier of this condition. So if the problem is in the aortic root, then how do you treat it? Before the genetics were dissected, it was well know that certain brands of turkey get aortic aneurysms and will die. And it turns out that giving those turkeys beta blockers makes them live longer. The notion is that they have a, quote, weak, unquote, aortic wall, and by reducing not the pressure in the aorta so much, as the rate of change of pressure, the DPDT, they are less susceptible to aortic rupture. And of course, propranolol also is effective in severe hypertension and is used in the treatment of dissecting aneurysms of the usual kind. Again, partly to lower the blood pressure, but mostly to lower the DPDT. So people have looked at the effect of beta blockers in Marfan syndrome and here's a study from the New England Journal in the early 1990s, showing patients who ended up on propranolol had a slower rate of change in the aortic diameter compared to patients who did not end up on a beta blocker. This is not a randomized trial, but it still nevertheless suggests that the trajectory of patients with Marfan syndrome can be altered by the use of propranolol, these are all patients with Marfan syndrome of course. So the state of the art is propranolol treatment which slows the progression of the disease and that's the way people thought. So the disease gene in Marfan Syndrome, is a gene called fibrillin. It's a large gene, and you can tell by its name that has something to do with the way the cells interact with the extracellular matrix. And for a long time, the notion was that mutations in fibrillin would somehow disrupt the extracellular matrix, and therefore result in this so called weak aortic wall. This slide shows many, many mutations, there are now many more mutations that are shown here. Each of which has been associated with Marfan syndrome in a family, so like other diseases that we've talked about familial hypercholesterolemia or the Long QT syndrome. This disease also has a single disease gene with many, many, many mutations, each one of them causing the disease. Now the problem came when people started to think more critically about this weak wall idea, and one of the breakthrough studies was actually in mice that have Marfan syndrome. So people looked at the lungs, and the lungs are one of the affected organs in humans as well as the mice. Humans develop early emphysema as a manifestation of Marfan syndrome. So when people looked at the elastin staining in mice with Marfan syndrome, it was completely normal. So that really suggests that fibrilin, despite its name and despite the appeal that somehow it weakens the extracellular matrix. Fibrillin actually has some other function, so here is the idea. Inside the cell there is a protein called LTBP, Latent TGF- beta binding protein. And its job in life is to hang on to a protein called TGF beta, transforming growth factor beta. And so it's job in life is to hold onto to TGF beta inside the cell. LTBP also interacts with the extracellular matrix through the, and it's a long protein as you can see from the cartoon and it interacts with fibrillin. Fibrillin is located inside the cell. So the notion is, when you get a mutation in fibrillin, it disrupts this complex, and when it disrupts the complex, the complex releases TGF-beta. And it's unrestrained TGF-beta signalling that actually results in the diverse manifestations of Marfan syndrome, from the bony structures to the aortic wall, to the lungs, to the lens of the eye. So that's the idea and what was really interesting in this story, is that there are patients who have almost Morfan syndrome, who have many of the manifestations, particularly the aortic manifestation, and yet who don't have mutations in fibrillin. They seem to have a related disease and that related disease now called Loeys-Dietz disease, because those are the first and last author of the paper that first described it, have mutations in the TGF-beta receptors. So, that again implicates this TGF-beta signaling problem, and unrestrained TGF-beta activation inside cells across the body, as the mechanism underlying Marfans syndrome, through pathways that are being worked out still. So Dr. Dietz, who's a leader in this field made mice that have Marfans syndrome and this is a picture of a mouse heart with the aortic root shown by the arrows. So the aortic root is pretty small, especially in mice it's really small. But if you give mice, if you construct mice with a fibrilin mutation, of the type that he's shown here, you can see the aortic root is much, much dilated. So the question then becomes, what happens if you give a treatment? Now the treatment, the standard treatment is a beta blocker and so, if you give the beta blocker, that's shown in panel C, the aortic root is smaller. But what's really interesting is, if you treat these mice starting when the mothers are pregnant, with losartan, which is an angiotensin receptor blocker that acts by inhibiting TGF beta signaling in cells. You get absolute prevention of the phenotype. You can see the aortic roots in the three mice on the bottom panels look just like the wild type. They don't aortic root dilatation at all. Now, there's a problem in a sense that you can't give people losartin when they're pregnant, because it causes birth defects. But this is a very important proof of principle that inhibiting the TGF-beta signaling pathway, gets at the root of the problem and can actually prevent the manifestations of the problem. Here is a small study of a group of patients who were put on an angiotensin receptor blocker, Losartan usually, and you can see that this is the progress of the aortic-root over time and you can see that what happens is, before the medicine has started, the aortic root is dilating as a function of time and after the medicine has started that dilatation almost stops. That's a much more impressive effect at least in this very small study, than the propranolol effect I showed you earlier. There are now about a dozen randomized trials going on, comparing losartan and drugs of that type to beta-blockers or to placebo. It's hard to think about having Marfan syndrome and taking placebo, but taking a beta blocker or losartan and those results are just now coming out. The very first of those trials has been reported and interestingly, losartan seems to slow the rate of progression in adults with Marfan syndrome in terms of aortic-root dilatation. So there's great excitement, the trials are going on, and where in this awkward phase where there are Evangelists, who really feel we've stumbled across a new medicine and we ought to just go ahead and use it, and the Purists who say we really ought to prove it in randomized trials. I think we're going to get to an answer, the National Marfan Organization is a place to go and get more information about that, and they website is shown here. So, I think this is a really compelling story from a syndrome that you sort of describe by saying well they have long fingers and long arms, to understanding a therapy based on what you understand from turkeys. To understanding the molecular genetics, to looking in great detail at how those molecular genetics work to cause the disease, and then coming up with therapies that appear to be relatively specific. And it's a very exciting time for Marfan, and I think it illustrates the power of going from a gene to a new therapy. [MUSIC] [SOUND]. >> [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/XtEsY/cystic-fibrosis","Cystic Fibrosis","[MUSIC] So in this module, what I want to talk about is the way in which genetics has informed the drug development process, a phenomenon that I have alluded to before. But in one particular disease to develop genotype specific drug therapy. And the problem is the problem of Cystic Fibrosis. The case that I'm going to use to illustrate this is a 22 year old woman who has frequent respiratory infections as most patients with symptomatic Cystic Fibrosis do. Diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis was made at age two. The FEV1 in the last year, or the last two years, has fallen from 45% of predicted to 27% of predicted. That's a pretty drastic decrease in the standard index that people use to gauge the extent of pulmonary disease and she's now being considered for the ultimate therapy in Cystic Fibrosis, a lung transplant. A lung transplant, of course, is not curative for Cystic Fibrosis. It trades in one disease for another disease, the other disease being management of the transplant. So recall that Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease. One person, one Caucasian, in 30 or 35 carries a mutant Cystic Fibrosis disease gene. I'll come back to what the disease gene is in a moment. And if they encounter a person who also is a carrier, that mating occurs one time in 900. One in 30 times one in 30. And then one in four of those children will develop Cystic Fibrosis, because they will inherit two genes. This is the autosomal recessive pattern that we see in Cystic Fibrosis. We'd see in Sickle Cell disease and we see in Mendel's peas where three normal peas and one recessive pea were the result of the matings that I described earlier on. Cystic Fibrosis affects multiple organ systems, but the main organ system that it affects is the lungs. Patients with symptomatic Cystic Fibrosis have to be very, very careful with nutrition, and spend a lot of time dealing with pancreatic enzymes and that sort of thing. There are many other manifestations that are shown on this slide, but the real life threatening event, or the real life ending event, is almost always pulmonary infections and pulmonary damage. The prognosis for patients with Cystic Fibrosis has improved quite strikingly over the last several decades, mainly because of increased attention to pulmonary toilet. People are very, very aggressive about physiotherapy and home physiotherapy to make sure the lungs are clear and stay clear. Despite a very aggressive physiotherapy, the average life expectancy is still less than 40 years of age. So the fundamental problem in Cystic Fibrosis are mutations in a gene called CFTR, the Cystic Fibrosis Transport Regulator. And that is actually a plasma membrane protein whose mission in life is to transport chloride from the inside of a cell to the outside of a cell. That happens normally, and chloride, when it's transported, drags water and sodium with it. Patients with Cystic Fibrosis do not have that chloride transport ability. They develop concentration of, their sweat becomes quite concentrated, for example, with chloride ions in one of the typical symptoms that we learn about in medical school is that a child with Cystic Fibrosis the mother will report that the sweat tastes quite salty, and that's because of this defect. Interestingly, CF mutations that cause Cystic Fibrosis were among the first that were discovered using modern genomic techniques, and the disease gene was actually isolated in the late 1980s. There was great hope at the time that we would just use gene therapy to correct the defect. In fact that hasn't happened, but the story I'm going to tell is how understanding the fundamental basis of disease actually informs the drug development process to the good of some patients. So this is the problem in Cystic Fibrosis, most patients the problem is, in fact, a misfolded protein that never gets to the cell surface. There's one common mutation that results in deletion of a phenylalanine in position 508 in the protein, the so called delta F508 mutation that results in a misfolded protein that is recognized as misfolded and never actually gets to to the cell surface. Other mutations, that's the class two mutation shown on this slide, the class one mutations are defects in protein processing, and then the class three and four mutations are defects in the way in which the channel behaves once it gets to the cell surface. So there are some channels that traffic normally to the cell surface, but once they get there, they actually don't conduct chloride, or they don't open it appropriately to conduct chloride under similatory conditions like increased intracellular AMP. So the idea here is to develop a drug that will fix the gating defect, that's the defect of the channels that get to the cell surface, but don't actually open and close properly once they get to the cell surface. So this is a cartoon of a channel that's like that, and the drug that was developed is a drug called Ivacaftor. And the cartoon shows that the idea behind Ivacaftor is it will interact with the cystic fibrosis regulate protein and that protein is the ion channel plus those little balls underneath, that's part of the protein, and allow chloride to exit the cell normally. So the way in which this drug was developed was really very, very interesting. It turns out that most mutations don't have a gating defect. So the first challenge was to identify a set of patients who have a genetic defect that results in an abnormality of gating. The defect that was targeted initially is a defect that results in a change in the amino acid that's called G551D. And that's a channel that gets to the cell surface, but doesn't gate properly. Only a small number of patients carry G551D, and this is the result of an initial trial of the drug, which didn't have a name at the time, in a small number of patients, and remember Cystic Fibrosis is a rare disease. G551D is a rare form of a rare disease, so how are you going to study a drug that is targeted to that rare form of the rare disease? You engage the Cystic Fibrosis community, and the Cystic Fibrosis community brought together investigators from all around the country, each one of whom might contribute one or two patients to a particular trial like this one. And what this slide shows is that within three days of starting Ivacaftor, the increase in chloride concentration in the sweat is normalized. That's the panel on the left. There was also a small increase in the FEV1, but remember that happens within three days of starting therapy as well. Although interestingly, there's a big placebo effect here as well, and you'd be hard pressed to say by the end of this particular trial that there was a major change in FEV1 compared to placebo. But these results were sufficiently encouraging, particularly the sweat chloride result, was sufficiently encouraging that people decided to go ahead and mount a trial that would last 48 weeks. The 48 week trial is shown here, and there's not much doubt that the drug does something enormous. So there is a huge increase in FEV1, that's the upper left panel. That is almost immediate and persistent over 48 weeks. There's a striking decrease in the number of events, hospitalizations, pulmonary exacerbations, that's the panel on the upper right. And what's really interesting is that there's pretty impressive weight gain. And that really suggests that many of the fundamental defects around this disease are being corrected by this particular drug. And that's so, these are results that were really outstanding and when you can read testimonials on the Web for example of patients who were parts of these trials, and they could tell, although these were randomized possible controlled double blind trials, they could tell within days whether they were on placebo or on the real thing. There are these very compelling stories of sisters, both of whom have the mutation, one of whom gets the drug and one of whom gets placebo and they know within a of couple of days, which one's on drugs. So it really has the potential to be life altering. Now the problem is that G551D is 5% of all mutations. And the real problem is that delta F508 is the biggie. And that's about 70% of all patients with Cystic Fibrosis carry that single variant. Of course they have two variant alleles. And so there's a hope that drugs that drag these abnormal channels to the cell surface, may be effective in some forms of Cystic Fibrosis, and it's possible that sometimes just dragging the channel to the cell surface will be enough to correct the defect. Sometimes you'll be able to drag the channel to the cell surface, and then you'll have to use another drug, perhaps Ivacaftor, or perhaps something else to actually change the gating of the channel. But there is this hope, that by understanding the fundamental mechanisms and developing drugs that specifically attack the defect conferred by a specific mutation, you'll actually get to the bottom of mechanism guided therapy. So there's been a huge amount of buzz around this. This is an FDA approved drug, and the big issue is cost. This drug costs $300,000 a year. And is that something that society can bear? There's a huge debate, as you can see, and the arguments go something like this. As you see at the bottom hot off the breath instead of hot off the press. Instead of Ivacaftor, I've a cost for. The $64,000,000 question. Now one side says, well we just can't afford that. The other side says, well you know, add up with the cost of taking care of a patient with Cystic Fibrosis are. How many times do they get admitted to the hospital? How many antibiotics do they chew up? How many enzymes do their intestines require in order to be able to digest foods? And when you add up the costs of taking care of these patients, compared to the cost of Ivacaftor, there are arguments to be made on both sides. Clearly a very, very expensive undertaking. There's a lot of concern that the community, the Cystic Fibrosis community, was responsible for the development of this drug and yet is being charged or overcharged for the cost of the drug. The pharmaceutical manufacturer, of course, takes a big risk by developing something like this. So these are unknowns, but this example is the first, I think, of many, many examples that we're going to face, because as we get better at defining the molecular basis, of not only common diseases, but rare diseases, we're going to have targeted, precise, highly effective therapies that will come at a price.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/A5KcD/inside-vumc-personalized-medicine-is-a-team-sport","**Inside VUMC: Personalized Medicine is a Team Sport","[MUSIC] So one thing I've learned about personalized medicine is that it's a team sport. So there's no single person that has enough expertise to do all the tasks that are necessary to do personalized medicine. So there need to be expert clinicians on the front end who can see patients and diagnose them appropriately. And then those people need to collaborate with both experts in genetics and genetic technologies to do the right testing, and make sure that testing, although complicated, is done correctly. There have to be biomathemeticians that can interpret that data. There have to be molecular biologists who can confirm that data using established technique and also extend that into using functional models, animal models, and cell models. And then that has to come full circle back to the clinician who's sitting at the bedside so that information can ultimately make people live longer and feel better. So I guess personalized medicine is complicated, and it's a team sport, and it's a team science, and collaboration is, I think, one of the things that has to be done well for personalized medicine to work.

Here in BioVU, samples come over from the clinical lab, where they were collected for clinical purposes. They've been there three days. They're tested. And they would be at the point of being discarded, when BioVU goes over and retrieves them. Stacy is setting up the samples into racks, which will then go onto the deck of our robot. This Tecan Freedom Evo has a built in bar code scanner, which will scan the bar codes on each of the tubes. That's linked to the database to confirm their status. And whether they're a duplicate, or an individual who's opted out of the program. The accepted samples are then taken back and weighed on the automated weigh cell. Samples that are over a ml are sorted into this area. Samples under a ml would be extracted on a different robotic system so there's that here. The samples that are greater than one ml need to end up in these processing vessels. Each of these needs to be labeled with a new random private ID number, which will be generated by this bar code scanner and applied to the tubes. We use these instruments to extract DNA from the samples. This Autopure can extract up to 16 blood samples at one time. The whole blood goes in in a bar-coded tube and purified DNA comes out in the blue bar-coded tubes.

Well, I wear several hats around here, most of them informatics and infrastructure. But one of the more interesting things I get to do involves ascertainment of patients for genetic studies. One of the most challenging things about these types of studies is finding the right people to study. And traditionally you would build an ascertainment core and manually track these people down, and collect information about consent and things. More recently, we've been able to take advantage of electronic medical records, and pull this information from behind the scenes, and try to find these people algorithmically using programs basically, find people that have the best criteria, that match our study. And so one of the roles I play there is writing these queries to identify these people, and to exclude people that have certain conditions that would conflict with the interests of the study. And this can be very hard because people that come to Vanderbilt are sick obviously, and so they're not sick with one thing, they have many conditions. And so you have to try to weed out the people that have the problems you're interested in, and maybe not necessarily some other problems. And so one of the ways that we like to do this is something, for example, like billing codes. So we try to find people that were billed for having some procedure that we're interested in. Say they had a heart attack, so we look for heart attack billing codes. Unfortunately these codes are sort of assigned haphazardly a lot of times, and so you might find 100 people that have the condition, and 50 of them might not actually have had the condition. And so you have to do a lot of tweaking, a lot of natural language processing culling through these doctors notes to try to find true cases and true controls. [SOUND] [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/z6YAF/using-electronic-records-to-personalize-care-delivery","Using Electronic Records to Personalize Care (Delivery)","[MUSIC] I've showed you this cartoon before. And driven by this vision of being able to deliver genetic information to the healthcare system, that is important for drug response, but deliver the information before the drug is prescribed, is the challenge that we face. And that at Vanderbilt, we created in a program called Predict, whose mantra is to deliver the right dose, and the right drug the first time. So the barriers to this kind of implementation project are considerable. The major barrier right now is the level of evidence that is needed to implement. So, we've talked a lot about rare variance, we've talked a lot about variance with modest effect sizes, and there are examples of variance with relatively robust effect sizes in the drug response field. And so, that was the place that we could start with the delivery of genomic information. There are other variants that may have large effects on people's health, but they're either rare, or the evidence around the fact that they have an impact is modest. So, doing this kind of project required review of a lot of published, and sometimes unpublished data, around the relationship between genetic variation and response. There are other issues in the personalized medicine implementation space that are important, and I'll mention here, that impacted our Predict project to a somewhat lesser degree. There are issues around regulation of genetic testing, that's something that the FDA has become involved in, and the FDA is quite interested in using these approaches, but in the context of appropriate evidence. For some of the tests, not the tests that we were using, but for some of the tests, there is an intellectual property issue. Somebody may have a patent around it, or may refuse to allow other laboratories to implement testing, and that's a subject of active debate in the courts right now, up to, and including, the Supreme Court. Our project was done as a pilot project, within the Vanderbilt environment, supported by the medical center. But one of the goals is to create an evidence base that will enable a discussion around reimbursement, because at some level, we think this information is going to be useful. There are issues around privacy. People are very concerned about the use of genetic information in their electronic medical records. And issues around privacy, interestingly, if we ask people, and we did ask people in focus groups, what about the use of genetic information to guide drug treatment? And the response is not, don't do that, the response is, I thought we were doing that part already. That's something that people are very receptive to. The idea of using genetic information to predict disease or predict susceptibility to certain kinds of complications of disease makes people a little bit more leery. And then, the whole idea of engaging broad populations across the medical center, and across the country, and across the world in these efforts to relate genetic variation and other personal variation to health care outcomes is one that encounters barriers at cultural levels, at socioeconomic levels, and so we want to embrace as many patients as we can in these kinds of efforts. So, again, it is not possible to conceive of a system in which you would deliver preemptive genetic information into an electronic medical record to be used at a time when a drug is prescribed, for example, in the absence of an electronic medical record system. It just cannot be done in a paper records system, I really believe that. I can't conceive of a way in which we could do that. This is a screenshot of an actual electronic medical record of a patient at Vanderbilt. All the identifiers have been blacked out for privacy reasons, but you can see that there's a list of physicians, those are all blacked out, a list of diagnoses, a list of drugs on the bottom right, and then above the list of drugs and below the list of drugs allergies and drug sensitivities, is drug genome interactions. That's a list of genetic variants that have been discovered in this particular patient for drugs that they may or may not be taking. The Predict program currently implements five drug gene pairs, based on, again, evidence in the literature, and based on a platform that we're using for genetic testing. So the idea is, somebody is identified as a potential participant in the Predict program. We have elaborate ways of identifying patients, which I'll talk about in a moment, and once they're identified, they're not tested for the drug that they may get in the future. They're tested for variants that are relevant to that drug, and many others, so we develop an archive of data, and I'll show you why that's important in a moment. So as we were planning the program, the FDA relabeled the drug Clopidogrel, and actually added a black box warning, which is their most extreme form of warning, saying that CYP2D2C19 variants are important in determining response. And look at the last bullet point, it says, consider alternative treatment, or treatment strategies, in patients identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. It doesn't say do the testing, and it doesn't say exactly what you should be doing, and that's one of the problems in personalized medicine. All they're saying is, there are data that the poor metabolizers have decreased response. Now that's incontrovertible. The question is, do alternate strategies improve that poor response? And do you actually go out and genotype absolutely everybody? So one of the parts of our Predict program was to identify patients who were at high risk for getting Clopidogrel or other drugs that are in our program within the next several weeks or months. Patients who are going to have a cardiac catheterization are at high risk for getting Clopidogrel, so that was one target population. Another population that we chased, was patients in the internal medicine clinic, who have a number of conditions that make it likely that they're going to get drugs like Clopidigrel, not over the next couple of weeks, but over the next couple of years. So a middle aged obese patient with hypertension and diabetes, that's the kind of patient who should have this kind of testing, we think, in order to use that information later. And of course, this is all a pilot program designed to asses how to do this at a first, it's what I call a baby steps. So these are the data for the first 13,500 patients studied in the Predict program and simplified, so there are 13,500 subjects, 361 of them have two copies of a loss of function variant in CYP2C19. The variant that is the commonest is CYP2C19*2, but there are also star three, star four, star six, and star eight, and they're also included in our assays. One comment that I need to make, is that the genetic information has to be as close to 100% correct as we can possibly make it. The analogy I like to make around this kind of information is, rotating on the wards, I will have a resident come to me and say, Mrs. Smith is in renal failure, because her serum creatinine is eight today. And I will say to myself, well, Mrs. Smith's creatinine was one yesterday, and people don't go from one to eight in a day. And besides, her electrocardiogram looks normal. And she feels fine. And so obviously, that's a lab mistake, do it again. And everybody, any clinician would recognize that. The problem with genetic information is that we don't have a context. So the genetic information has to be correct the first time, if we're going to act on it. That's a generic problem across laboratory medicine, of course. So out of the 13,000 patients, we have 2.7% who are homozygous, 19% who are heterozygous. The evidence there is probably to do something, but the evidence not quite as strong, and then 88% who have no variant. So, one way to look at these data is to say, well, if youre going to genotype everybody who starts Clopidogrel treatment, you're going to do it in 100 patients, to find two or three who are homozygous. And that's one of the arguments against the use of personalizing therapy, based on CYP2C19. In order to get outcome data, you have to study thousands and thousands, probably hundreds of thousands of patients, in order to figure out what's going on with that 2.7%. The paradox of large numbers in personalized medicine I alluded to in the last module. Now I told you we do five drug gene pairs. So these are the data for five drug gene pairs and what's interesting here is, that when you look across all five, there's only 11% of patients that have no variants. So the way to look at this is to say almost everybody has a variant that could affect their response to one of these five drugs. This is a very simple experiment. And so you don't know what the variant is and you don't actually know whether that patient's going to get that drug. But it highlights the virtue of multiplex testing, because remember, the cost of this testing is the same whether you do one variant, or five variant, or in fact 200 variants, if you have 200 variants that are important. So the virtue of the preemptive testing is that you do all the testing at once, and then you're able to act on it for an individual when the time comes. And we think this is a model for delivering genomic information into the course of health care, and it will depend on the strength of evidence, it'll depend on the allele frequency, and it'll depend on the ability of the physician, or the health care system, the health care provider, to actually interpret the data. So what happens in our system, is that if a patient with genetic information in the chart receives a prescription for Clopidogrel, the system will look at if the genetic data are variant, then the system will deliver a pop-up. And this is what the pop-up looks like. I'm not going to read it all, it just says in red letters in the red box at the top genetic testing has been done, and you may want to change the dose, and it offers alternative treatments. And the alternative treatments may change as a function of time, as a function of the evidence that we accumulate, or it offers the option of staying the same. And one of the things that we're looking very hard at now, is how often this fires, how often do physicians pay attention, how often do other health care providers pay attention, and what are the long-term outcomes in terms of preventing in stent thrombosis, preventing recurrent myocardial infarction, because that's the name of the game. And it's too early to say much about that, but this is the dataset that we need to accumulate in order to answer that kind of question. I've been very Vanderbilt-centric, and I'm very proud of the efforts that we make at our center, but there are other centers that do very similar kinds of things. This is point of care decision support for Clopidogrel at the University of Maryland. And this is a warning that pops up at St. Jude's Children's Hospital in patients who are receiving, or about to receive, codeine and have the CYP2D6 ultra rapid metabolizer status. So this kind of coupling between genomic information obtained preemptively, and the electronic medical record system warning capabilities is being built at a number of places. And one of the things that we've come to realize is that there's a very important evidence review. That needs to be done for each one of these drug chain pairs. And, so, one of the tasks that the Pharmaco Genetics Research Network, another network sponsored by NIH, and the Pharmaco Genetics knowledge base at Stanford have taken on together with investigators within the PGRN, is the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium and basically the idea of a consortium, which publishes its results, and those are widely available now, is to ask the question, if you have these data, what should you do with them? It does not pose the question, when should you get them? That's a different question. But if you have the data available to you, how should you act on them? And the idea is on the left in general, you assign a genotype, and then a combination of genotypes called a diplotype, then you make a guess, not a guess, you make a prediction of what the phenotype, the drug response phenotype or the drug metabolism phenotype will be, and then a recommendation based on that phenotype. So an example is a patient is discovered to have CYP2D6*4*4, star four is one of the most loss of function alleles. The prediction, therefore, is the patient is a poor metabolizer and the prediction therefore is to avoid codeine, because that drug will not be biotransformed, and will therefore produce less than optimal anelgesia. So that's the idea behind CPIC, and it requires evidentiary review which is one of the major steps, and so this is an important step in implementing pharmacalgenomics. I want to close with a picture, and the picture is the one on the left. When we were implementing our Predict program, we started with Clopidogrel, We were looking very hard for a patient who has the CYP2C19*2*2 genotype, and this is her. She's seated next to her doctor, the doctor who actually put the stent in her coronary artery. And I love this picture because it epitomizes, for me, personalized medicine. It's not about large data sets, it's not about statistics, it's not about GWAS, it's about individual physicians taking care of individual patients. Now that patient has other diseases, that patient takes other drugs, that patient shouldn't take certain drugs because they're beyond a certain age. That patient has values of her own that dictate whether she wants aggressive, or not aggressive treatment, for certain kinds of diseases. That's all part of the personalized medicine equation. And then her physician can turn to her and say, well, for you, in addition to all those other considerations, it's important to treat you with these medicines because of your genetic makeups. The genetics is part of a personalized medicine relationship. And Sir William Osler, the great Canadian physician, said it well when he said, the good physician treats the disease; the great physician treats the patient who has the disease. That, for me, is the epitome of personalizing medicine. Now there are lots of people who are interested in the idea of personalized medicine, I just want to close by giving you a sense of the kinds of resources there are around the web, mainly, to access further information. One of the things people are very nervous about is using genetic information to discriminate in terms of healthcare delivery. There's a law that was passed by the Republican and Democratic House of Representatives and Senate, signed by President Bush, in the late 2000s, in 2008, called the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act, or GINA. And GINA prevents discrimination based on genetic test information in terms of health care. There are other issues around GINA that make it not the perfect law for example, you can still be denied long-term health insurance, which of course could be an issue for some genetic conditions, and it specifically excludes federal employees, strangely. The FDA has become very, very interested, and has issued a large and relatively thoughtful White Paper on personalized medicine, and how they're going to try to regulate personalized medicine, and how they're going to try to help move the field forward in a rational, evidence based way. It's called Paving the Way for Personalized Medicine, freely available on the Web. And then there are many other sources, I've already alluded to the idea that the National Human Genome Research Institute has many programs, and they are posted on their website, there is something called the Personalize Medical Coalition, which has a course called Personalized Medicine 101 on their website, there are many places you can read about that. And then every disease that I've talked about, the rare diseases where there's a big genetic story, has very active web presences, and very educational materials around their particular site. I will highlight the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, because when I talked about the idea of developing Ivacaftor for this one particular rare variant in the Cystic Fibrosis Transport Regulator, the Cystic Fibrosis disease gene, it took accruing patients from many, many, many physicians, many sites, to develop enough numbers to show that the drug works, and that was really enabled by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation working with physicians who take care of the patients, to accrue the right number of patients. So they've been very active partners, in not only public advocacy, but in actually developing new therapies. And I'll close with this slide which I've shown before, again, emphasizing the idea that we now have the opportunity, by looking at large data sets, to identify patient characteristics, and that includes genetics, which I've spent a lot of time talking about, and other kinds of characteristics that drive individualization of therapy. So the future is very bright. There are lots of problems that need to be overcome, and the important thing about what I've talked about in this module, is that we're attacking those problems. We're trying to develop methods, trying to learn how best to do this in a way that helps patients, helps physicians, and actually controls costs as opposed to driving them up. [MUSIC] [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/V0UZS/electronic-medical-records-the-learning-healthcare-system-discovery","Electronic Medical Records & The Learning Healthcare System (Discovery)","[MUSIC] Well today, I want to talk a little bit about the role of electronic medical records in the administration or in the delivery of personalized medicine information, and the way in which I want to start that discussion is by showing you this cartoon. One of my favorite cartoons was published in the New Yorker in the year 2000, along with the announcement that the first draft of a human genome sequence had been completed. And the woman hands the pharmacist, her sequence and says, here's my sequence. Now you do something good with it, pick the right drug for me. And the things that I like about this cartoon are first of all, the pharmacist doesn't look like he knows what to do with that information and many of us in this kind of personalized medicine space sometimes feel the same way. The second is that she's not handing it to her doctor, she's handing it to part of a health care team and I think it's going to take teamwork to deliver this kind of information, to use this kind of information to better people's health care, and the third thing that's sort of interesting and I'm pretty sure is wrong is that she has it on a piece of paper. And whatever way in which we're going to deliver sequence information to the healthcare system to allow the system to use it, to presumably improve our care, it is not going to be on a piece of paper, that seems pretty clear to me. So this is the way the medical record room looked at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the early 1990's and anyone who participated in the care of patients in that era or before is familiar with the large manilla charts and the manilla folders and how often it was that you couldn't find those charts in order to take care of a patient. Or you had a chart that was 14 volumes, which is probably two or three feet thick and you had to find some piece of information in that chart somewhere. So there are many things that having electronic medical records can enable and I want to give you some examples of those. So first of all, electronic medical records can help in the care of individual patients. Before there were electronic medical records, it was possible to have a call from the emergency room saying, I have a patient here who was discharged from your hospital 12 hours ago. They're semi-comatose, we don't know what the diagnosis is, we don't know anything about the patient, and we don't know what medications they take, and trying to find the chart of a patient like that would be next to impossible at 3 o'clock in the morning. It was probably locked up in some resident's desk waiting to have the discharge summary dictated. So having immediate access to that kind of information can really help improve the care of individual subject. It can also help the system. So in 2004, the drug Vioxx was recalled from the market, a very widely used painkiller, particularly in rheumatoid arthritis. It was withdrawn and one important question is which of our patients is taking Vioxx? Now, imagine trying to deal with a healthcare issue like that in a paper kind of environment. In an electronic environment, you can ask the system and then develop ways in which to contact those patients or ways in which the physician's offices can contact those patients. A physician says, well, I'm starting the patient on one drug. Do they take any other drugs whose dose I should adjust? The question of drug interactions, everybody's familiar with that idea, but the number of drug interactions is huge and some of them are very, very important. Some of them are less important and so the question is every time you add a drug to a complicated regiment, are you running the risk of a drug interaction? Do you need to know about that? Do you need to be alerted? On the other hand, I will say now that there are certain things electronic medical records don't do well. And if you alert physicians 20 times a day every time they change medications for drug interactions that are probably trivial, they start to ignore everything. And they start to ignore everything, they'll ignore the important stuff. Of course, electronic records have the problem that somebody has to do the input. There's a lot of push back in the healthcare community around the need to develop those records. But I think once the growing pains are over, the healthcare system can be efficient enough that you can not slow down to actually get the information into the record and actually improve care. So a researcher will come to me and will say, I'm interested in studying variability in vitamin D levels. How many of our patients have vitamin D levels across this entire system? That's a question that you could never even ask in a paper environment. Now you can ask and you can also ask as I'll show in a minute, do any of them have DNA samples that are stored somewhere? That would be an important question for a researcher, and then a physician might say, well, a patient tells me he gets high every time he gets codeine for dental pain, then a physician might say, I wonder why that is? I hope many of you will have guessed that that person is probably an ultra rapid metabolizer for CYP2D6 and they biotransform codeine into morphine very, very rapidly. Now it would be nice to know that information in a patient before they get codeine, you can do it by history or you can do it by having the genetic information embedded in their electronic medical record against the day that they might receive a CYP2D6 substrate. And in the next module, I'll talk about initial efforts at our center and other places to actually execute that kind of vision. So at Vanderbilt, we have created large resources for using electronic medical records as a tool for research for discovery and that's what I want to talk about here. And in the next module, I'll talk about how we use that to also delivery information that we hope will improve healthcare. So we have created a de-identified image of our entire electronic medical record and that is over 2.3 million subjects. Because it's de-identified, it's relatively easy to use for accruing large sets of patients and asking interesting questions about what it is their like? What it is that they have? How their diseases, or their conditions, progressed? And notice I haven't used the word genetic yet, because the 2.3 million people don't have DNA samples, but you can still use that information to predict who after admission to the hospital is likely to get a bedsore. After admission to hospital, which patient is likely to be discharged and readmitted within 30 days? And if you could use information from examining large numbers of subjects to develop predictive tools like that, you can start to personalize care on the level of preventing complications in the hospital. On the level of preventing remissions on the level of individualizing or personalizing care, which has nothing to do with genetics. At Vanderbilt, we've created a large data bank that we call BioVU that includes around 185,000 subjects that have DNA samples coupled to these identified electronic medical records. And we're in the process of doing a lot of genetic work on those at the GWAS level and other kinds of levels to use that information. To do discovery. Discovery of variants that drive variability in drug response, variants that drive variability and susceptibility to disease. So I alluded to this idea before, that an investigator might have this question around vitamin D. And in fact one of our investigators had exactly that question. So we've created an interface at Vanderbilt that allows an investigator to ask that question and get an answer within 60 seconds. So they go to a web site, the web site looks like this, and it's a lot of drag and dropping. But they basically drag and drop the vitamin D levels and ask, how many patients do we have with vitamin D levels that is something greater than 17,000 in our electronic medical record. And then they'll ask how many of those patients have genetic information, and it's something around 10,000. And then the intersection of those sets, right now it's around 1,795 a subject. So that's something that happens on a high speed search engine, and it happens instantaneously. So an investigator can find out how many samples there are, and is there viability in doing a study. One of the other things that we have done at Vanderbilt is we've developed a new kind of technology to interrogate the relationship between human diseases and genetic variation. The top of this slide shows the typical GWAS approach, or a typical approach across genetics, identify a phenotype. The phenotype could be high or low cholesterol. The phenotype could be breast cancer in your family. The phenotype could be macular degeneration. The phenotype could be red hair. And then you do a genome wide scan across 500,000 or a million common SNPs in the genome and you come up with signals using the Manhattan plot, that's familiar to many of you. That's the GWAS, the genome-wide association study. We've created the phenome-wide association study which we call PheWAS. And the PheWAS turns that question on its head. It says here is a gene or here is a genetic variant that seems to be of biological interest. But I don't know exactly what human phenotype it associates with. So I take the particular genetic variant and I do exactly the same search strategy as with the GWAS. I take the genetic variant and I say you either have the reference allele or you have a variant allele. And then for every diagnosis in the electronic medical record I say you have the diagnosis or you don't have the diagnosis. So you create a two-by-two table, you attach a P value to that two-by-two table, and you display the data just like a Manhattan plot. And you can see on that particular PheWAS that I'm showing you here, there are some dots that seem to rise up, and I'll show you those on a subsequent slide in a moment. The idea is, to do this experiment you have to have many, many patients with many, many diagnoses. And the electronic medical record lends itself to that very, very nicely. So we actually developed the technology. And then searched across the GWAS catalog that is maintained at the NIH, that lists all the publications that have had a GWAS result since the beginning of that technology in the mid 2000s. So there are around 12,000 publications, sorry, around 1,700 publications, with around 12,000 SNPs. Now, some of those are phenotypes that are not represented in the electronic record. Are you able to smell your urine, detect a funny smell in your urine after eating asparagus? Well that's not something we record in the electronic records, that's not something we can address. Hair color, baldness, those are the kinds of things that we can't address. But we can address things like susceptibility to diabetes and susceptibility to disease, variable drug responses. Each one of these dots represents a particular GWAS result that has been published. And the position of the dot is the position on the chromosome with which the dot is associated. So we took the ones we could test and just asked the question, can you replicate those using PheWAS? And around two-thirds of the associations were replicated in the electronic medical record. And that's all published at a website whose URL is shown there. What was really interesting is this result, and that is the pleiotropy result. And that is we take a genetic variant, in this particular case, in a gene called IRF4, and that IRF4 variant is associated with hair and eye color. But when we do an interrogation across the genome we detect very strong signals with P values of 10 to the -10th, 10 to the -12th, 10 to the -14th, incontrovertibly strong, with a variety of skin cancers and actinic keratosis. So that's a new association that is detected by PheWAS, and we're very excited by the idea that you can use this to start to dissect the genetic architecture of many complicated diseases. The PheWAS data set was actually done at Vanderbilt, and a number of other collaborating institutions, as part of something called the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network, or eMERGE. Sponsored by the National Human Genome Research Institute, one of the 27 institutes at the NIH. And there were five centers that are shown on this slide as part of eMERGE-1 that participated in that PheWAS study. Now what eMERGE-1 did was actually just ask whether DNA collections coupled to electronic records can be used for discovery in genome science. Discovering new associations using GWAS or PheWAS or whatever technology that we can come up with. The carrot for us was to identify a phenotype of interest in around 3,000 subjects and do a genome-wide study at our center. It turned out what happened was, every center had their own GWAS, they're all too small to come up with a reasonable signal. But when we aggregate them across the network we came up with reasonable signals. We had other questions in eMERGE having to do with data privacy. Assessing consent mechanisms, how do you get people to consent and what are they consenting for, what are they not consenting for? And then develop methods to actually find cases and controls for target phenotypes like drug response or disease progression in electronic medical records. This is one example of work from eMERGE, one additional example. This is a phenotype that we identified that we wanted to study across the network, it was hypothyroidism. So we identified around 1,000 cases and around 5,000 controls using an electronic phenotyping algorithm that was developed in one site and validated at others. And you can look at the positive predictive values and the negative predictive values for the case and control definitions on this table. And you can see that the algorithms perform quite well across multiple sites with multiple electronic medical records and electronic medical record architectures. And that's a very important result because it says that you can use the algorithms developed in one site with one EMR to find cases and controls at other sites, perhaps with a different EMR system. All the electronic algorithms are posted at a website called PheKB whose title is shown there. The National Human Genome Research Institute is very interested in the idea of genomic medicine and personalizing medicine. They have a number of efforts besides eMERGE. They're shown here, the NSIGHT Network is looking at neonatal sequencing. The Undiagnosed Disease Network is looking at rare cases and using exome sequencing to come up with answers. The Clinical Sequencing Research Consortium, CSER Is looking at using sequencing in targeted diseases like cancer, or eye diseases, and there are other initiatives that are shown here. The overall questions that are being asked in these, and many other initiatives around the country and in fact around the world, are which patients do we want to sequence, do we want to apply new technologies to? What are we trying to accomplish when we do the sequencing? Are we trying to find susceptibility to cancer, or are we trying to find causes of disease? Are we doing sequencing in healthy people, and how do we deal with that information? How do you analyze genomes? How do you get these data sets across many, many ancestries, because I've alluded to the importance of ancestry before. How do you actually figure out how to get that information, once you're sure that it's important, into electronic medical records so it can be used in the future? And how do you analyze the results of all those efforts in terms of healthcare outcomes, and in terms of how much does it cost? Does it ultimately save the system money by creating a system in which there are fewer drug side effects, and better targeted therapies, and better focus of healthcare resources on people who are at high risk for diseases? Now, we're doing that across the eMERGE network and across other networks in the United States. But there are many other efforts around the United States, and around the world, that are accumulating large number of subjects, with DNA samples coupled to dense phenotypic measures. Sometimes that's the electronic medical record, sometimes that's large cohort studies, where there's dense systematic phenotyping. The Biobank in the UK is one example of the latter approach. And these are some of the examples around the world. And you can see that there are literally millions of patients whose DNA samples and dense phenotypes have been coupled, and are available for these kinds of studies. And I call this the paradox of personalized medicine. So, in order to treat 1 patient in a 100 differently from the average, you have to have evidence, you have to have data. Where's that data going to come from? It's not going to come from studying 100 patients and finding the 1 outlier, that's an anecdote. It's going to come from studying 100,000 patients, and finding the 1,000 that are outliers. Or it's going to come from the million and finding the 10,000 that are outliers or the 1,000 that are outliers. So in order to be able to develop the evidence to personalize medicine, we actually have to start with very, very large numbers, very large denominators from which to draw these smaller subset numerators. And the kinds of things that we and many other people are thinking about in terms of using these resources, is to study rare genotypes. So, the SLC30A8, or the PCSK9 variance that I've talked about in previous modules, how many people across the world have those? Are there other examples like that? In order to find the rare genotypes and convince yourself that those are actually real, you have to have very large denominators. Studying patients with extreme phenotypes, rare adverse drug reactions is at the top of everybody's list, but there's the flip side. There are patients who get a single drug for a generally fatal condition and they're cured. What's that all about? We call those elite responders, it's a term that the cancer doctors like to use, but that happens in other areas of medicine. We would like to know what identifies those patients, is there something specific about them, or their disease that makes them elite responders? And then were very excited about the idea of using phenome wide scanning, but what we need is not a data set of 10,000 or 20,000, but a data set of 100,000 or 200,000, in which to start to really explore the relationships between genotype and phenotype across rare uncommon genetic variance. Now, at the end, how is this going to work? We're using the healthcare system for discovery, and in order to use the healthcare system for discovery, we have to have a couple of infrastructure requirements. One is, there has to be basic science behind all this. What do these genetic variance do? What do they mean? Who's going to discover the mechanism whereby a genetic variant affects the human genotype? That is a really, really important question. You have to have an informatics engine that actually maintains the electronic medical record, maintains the ability to mine and interpret the data, those are the requirements. And then you can use the healthcare system for discovery in the ways in which I've started to outline and in many other ways. But once you use the healthcare system for discovery, what you have to do is implement that discovery. And as you implement that discovery, you change the way people's healthcare is delivered. You start to accumulate new information on what happens to patients. You start to make new discoveries, and the whole thing turns into a positive feedback loop. The more we implement, the more genetic data there are. The more information we have, and the more new discoveries we'll make, and the more we'll be able to implement. So that's called a learning healthcare system. A healthcare system that sees, for example, what kinds of patients are at risk for bed sores after they're admitted to the hospital. That takes measures to prevent those bed sores, or pay special attention to those patients, and that in turn reduces the number of bed sores. So the healthcare system teaches us what to do, and in that way we learn, and we have better outcomes. I use the bed sore example because it specifically has nothing to do with genetics, but has everything to do with personalizing. But you can use exactly the same kind of logic that includes genetic and other markers. So that's the learning healthcare system, and that's the ultimate goal of the electronic medical records system, as a tool for discovery and implementation in personalized medicine.

I introduce a cocktail of transcription factors that reprogram the deferentia cell to a stem cell like state. And then, once these stem cells are validated as truly being pluripotent, able to differentiate all three germ layers. Then I push them specifically, to be differentiated towards cardiac myocyte lineages. And this is done by plating them in a 3D matrix, or an extracellular matrix, that would somewhat resemble that, is seen in the developing embryo. And we use different growth factors to stimulate their differentiation towards myocytes and so we validate that the differentiation is happening. When you first start to observe beading clusters of cell within the petri dish, some people have provocatively called it a heart in a petri dish.

I'm a MD/PHD student here at Vanderbilt University and I've been working in the Vernon lab for about a year now. The arm of research that I'm involved with, is looking at what are the functional implications of some of these genetic variance that the rest of the group has identified. Historically, this has been by taking a gene contained a mutation and expressing it in a standard cell line and then studying the functional implications. Unfortunately, it's a little bit of a limited approach in some cases, where there is either complex genetic inheritance where it's, multiple variants contributing a small risk to degeneration and disease, and so in these cases it's really important to be looking in a genetic background specific manner. And so I do this by taking patient skin samples, isolating the fibroblasts and reprogramming them to induce pluripotent stem cell state and these are known as induced pluripotent stem cells or IPSCs. The IPSCs can then be differentiated into cardiac myocytes and then we can study the electrical activity of these cells, and so this is a very patient specific approach to understand how an individual variant contributes to disease susceptibility. And this is of particular importance as we try to treat these patients, because if we dont understand the deficits, it's really hard to work towards how to treat the patients to remove or fix the impairment. IPSCs are a great tool for drug discovery. And it's either to develop new drugs, so it's a way to screen in human cell ions. So it's species specific. And then we can also look in a tissue specific way by differentiating the IPSCs to either cardiomyocytes or another cell type that might be of interest for drug targeting. You could also test efficacy of known drugs. So if you take a IPS line that has a unique or novel variant and you're not sure how to treat it, this is an in vitro or cell culture approach where you can treat with different drugs and look for the desired response. By using patient specific IPSCs, we can actually look for the desired effect, but also the adverse effects, and these are then pretty well characterize where in speaking about cardiac electrophysiology. The down side is that you're perturbing the cell for your benefit, but that can also increase adverse effects. So by using IPSC's you can look at the therapeutic benefit, but also the risk profile of different drugs in this individual patient. Because we do know that there is an individual component for every individual to respond slightly differently to a certain drug.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/aaIGo/where-we-are-going","Where We Are Going","[MUSIC] For the last module, I reviewed where we have been and the kinds of concepts that are popular now and that are being worked on in personalized medicine. I want to continue that theme and look a little bit toward the future of where this is going in the next year or two or three. I think it's probably arrogant to try to think of where we're going to be in ten or twenty years, but here are some areas where people are working on them right now. I don't think they're ready to be implemented in any kind of clinical personalized medicine space, but they're really interesting and they may be ready soon. So one of the areas that we hear about a lot is the so-called microbiome. When I was in medical school, we always learned about the bacterial flora that populate our bodies, usually in the gut, but it turns out that they're in many other places. And this is a cartoon from a recent review article showing that there are normal flora that inhabit almost every part of our bodies and they're made up of different types of bacteria. And the recognition that there are probably for every DNA molecule that comes from our germ line, there are probably 100 or 1,000 or 100,000 DNA molecules that come from the bacteria that live with us. Had led people to think about what do those bacterial do and how are they influencing the diseases that we get? So one very obvious place to think about that is in gastrointestinal disease, because we all have the GI tract is full of bacteria and people have looked very, very hard at the relationship between the microbiome and inflammatory bowel disease on the left or gastroesophageal reflux disease on the right and there are associations. And the hope, of course is that by adjusting the microflora, you can prevent the microbiome, you can prevent these diseases or at least have an impact on the rate at which they occur. Now those are obvious examples, but there are other examples now where there's increasing evidence where the microbiome may play a role in In disease susceptibility. Asthma is one or two on the upper left. Psoriasis and then obesity. And most generally, the questions around the microbiome are how do you get the microbiome? How is it populated at birth and does it change after birth? Do early antibiotics predispose to obesity? There's a nice line of investigation that suggests that. And is there a connection between the microbiome and changes in the microbiome and other diseases who's incidence appears to be changing quite rapidly? Food allergies, peanut allergies, asthma, diabetes, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, even autism. Is there a relationship to cancers in the GI tract and elsewhere? What happens when you feed people antibiotics, when you feed animals antibiotics? How does that affect us? Does the microbiome change the way in which drugs that are taken orally are absorbed? And can we use the microbiome to look at health? Can we use the microbiome to develop better antibiotics? So those are very, very exciting areas of research that will probably have an impact on the way in which we personalize medicine over the next half decade or decade. Another area that's really exciting is illustrated by these two examples here. This is an example of genetic changes in schizophrenia and the problem of copy number variation and then the problem of the extreme QT prolongation in autosomal recessive case of the long QT syndrome. The problem with both of these diseases is that investigators would be very, very interesting in studying, for example, brain cells from a patient with schizophrenia and these variants or heart cells from a patient with the long QT syndrome due to these variants. Studying the individual cells from the affected patient. Now, it's not possible in general to accumulate brain tissue or heart tissue. You can do it by biopsies, but those are very, very specialized circumstances. So within the last half decade has come along an ability to take a skin biopsy in a patient with a known phenotype. That phenotype can be schizophrenia, it could be a cardiomyopathy, it could be cancer susceptibility, it can be a heart arrhythmia disease. It create fiber blasts in a dish, coax the fiber blasts to become pluripotent stem cells. Coax those pluripotent stem cells to become the tissue of choice. Neurons, cardiomyocites, intestinal cells and then study the effect of disease in that particular patient in the test tube. So that's a very exciting area, stay tuned. Now I've shown you this slide before, the idea that we're all descended from out of Africa populations and the idea again that we are different based on continental ancestry, whether you're European, African or Asian. And also within those continental divides within those continental divisions, you can actually subdivide populations across geography. So this is a very nice illustration I've shown before of how the purple and blue parts are Iberian peninsula genes and the pink parts are Central European genes and the yellow parts are Greek genes and they're different enough that you can actually identify some populations within a European ancestry population. At that comes along with increasing genetic mapping of common and rare variants. And ultimately, from sequencing. So that's an interesting area, because if there are diseases that are unique to these populations, we can study those diseases enriched in those populations. Understand the genetic mechanisms of disease and then generalize those genetic mechanisms across the world. Here is one example of how important ancestry can be in terms of traits that we don't ordinarily think of as genetic. This is the distribution of reference or wild type alleles and varied alleles color coded as you see in the lower left-hand corner in a gene called APOL1. APOL1 is thought to confer the APOL1 variance are particularly prevalent in West Africa and our thought to confer protection against sleeping sickness and that's why they persist in the population. Now many of the African Americans, most of the African Americans who live in the United States have their ancestry in Western Africa. So this allele happens to be quite common in African American populations with minor allele frequencies of up to 25%. There are actually two variance called the G1 and G2 variant but they come from the same kind of phenol types. And of course, sleeping sickness is not a big deal in the United States, but what is a big population in the African population in United States is hypertension and diabetes. And the problem with hypertension and diabetes is that many of those patients go on to get renal failure and what's interesting is that these alleles appear to predispose patients to getting more rapid development of renal failure. More rapid development for the need of dialysis, more rapid development of the need for kidney transplant, if they have hypertension. And this is one of many articles that discusses that. These alleles are not present in the European ancestry populations or the Asian ancestry populations. So this is an example of how it becomes very, very important to study many, many ancestries in order to get a picture of what the physiology of disease. And the pathophysiology of disease progression, disease development, disease drug responses might be. Another example is an interesting issues that revolves around the Havasupai Indians and their foray into genetics. The details of the story are controversial, but what is clear is that investigators went to the Havasupai because they have a high incidence of type two diabetes. And with the engagement of the tribe, started a project to look at whether they could identify predictors of type two diabetes among the Havasupai Indians. They collected phenotypic information around diabetes and they collected genetic samples. Now the problem became that it looked like the genetic samples might have been used for other uses. And there was a big controversy around that and it included a monetary settlement to the Indian tribe and ultimately destruction of the genetic samples. And the story is important to tell not because it's somebody's fault or not because it should have been done this way or that way. But it raises very, very interesting issues around the use of DNA samples in populations that have confined or restricted genetics. So a population like the Havasupai are an isolated population and they may have genetic variances that don't exist or don't exist at high allele frequencies elsewhere. So one issue that was raised is the issue of informed consent. If you consent to a diabetes study using GWAS, should your samples be used for a diabetes study for sequencing. Could your samples be used to study a different disease? Could your samples be used to gauge the frequency of alleles without regard to disease. And each of those raises interesting questions about what exactly people consent to and what exactly people will consent to in the future. So samples that were collected ten years ago for genetic studies might have included the possibility of studying other diseases but probably didn't include the possibility of whole genome sequencing. Does that mean you can use those samples? Probably not unless you go back to those subjects and ask them again. What do you do with the results? We'll talk about that in a moment. The Havasupai data were also used, or could have been used to study patterns of human migration of the type that I showed on a slide earlier. But the problem there is that the lore of the tribe may have particular value to members of the tribe. And they may not be interested in understanding the genetic base, using genetics to study human migration. They may have their own lore and they don't want to have their genes used to study that particular problem. They might want to have their genes used to study diabetes. If you find genes that predispose to obesity, or predispose to autism, or traits like that, the tribe, or individuals within the tribe could be stigmatized. The question of how do you go about studying diseases requires that you have the genetic information, plus access to electronic or other kinds of medical records. And there's always a question of how that's going to work. And if you have a large data set of patients, there are ways in which you can strip those records of identifiers but they are never perfect. And so there's always this potential that if you're part of a genetic study, your information could become available publicly through malicious attack on the records. So the Havasupai issue raises all kinds of things that we have to think about as we go forward in genetic testing at a clinical level and genetic research using large scale sequencing. So I've shown this slide before showing that sequencing costs are dropping dramatically. They seem to have plateaued in the last year or two, interestingly, but there's ever hope that they will drop again with the advent of new technologies. And within 5 or 10 years, we might even have the $100 genome. And of course you don't know what to do with the $100 genome, it's the million Dollar informatics problem attached to the $100 genome, that's the real problem. So, what are we going to do is not very clear, but here is a really interesting paper. And it's actually the first example of a full sequence human genome that was annotated for all the variants that might be of interest. The story is that the author whose name is highlighted, Stephen Quake, was the developer of one of the newer technologies to sequence human genomes. He sequenced, of course, his genome, and then he went to the informatics group at Stanford, and asked, what do I do with this information. And they spent really a couple of years annotating his human genome sequence, in three teams. In a team that looked at common variations, GWAS kind of variation, and so often they were increased or decreased risk. If he was at increased or decreased risk of common diseases like diabetes or coronary disease. They looked at a set of rare variants, we'll come back to that one in a second, and they looked at pharmacogenetic variants. And at the end of the day, the pharmacogenetic variants may be the only one of interest right now, but going forward, that may change a lot. So at the time this paper was published, he had 2.6 million SNPs, now he probably has more than that in fact. But the human genome annotations weren't sufficiently dense to actually understand what's a variant or not. Lots of copy number variations probably has more than that and when this paper came out in the late press, it was really very, very interesting. There was a focus on pharmacogenetic variance, because those seem to be actionable right now, at least some of them. And then there was a big focus on whether he was an increased risk for coronary diseases, and he was 40 at the time, should he take a statin? And it had to do with the fact that he has a couple of GWAS related genetic variance that increases risk for coronary disease quite modestly. That is not a question where genetics are going to probably play a major role in clinical decision making, there are other ways to do that. The other problem is looking at rare variants. Now I've shown you this slide before. And I'll show you some of Steve Quake's data in a moment, but in this slide which I've shown you before, highlighted the fact that this was a study looking at Framingham and the Jackson Heart study. Framingham largely European American, and Jackson Heart study used mostly African American. 11% of 3,600 subjects had rare non-synonymous variants in eight hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy genes. That's a huge number, though does that mean 11% of the population has those diseases? Probably not, because those diseases are pretty rare. Now you can go through those 11% And annotate them using informatics tools and try to figure out whether they're likely pathogenic. So you look at things like are they conserved across species? If that particular residue is conserved across species and is now changed in an individual it's more likely that it's pathogenic. Those are the kinds of things that people can do. And, obviously, if its been reported before in a family with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, that makes it more likely to be pathogenic. So only 22 of those variants were judged to be likely pathogenic. But out of those 22 patients, only 4 had cardiomyopathy. So we're going to have the problem of finding variance through sequencing in genes that we know can have variance that cause serious disease, and we won't know what to do with them. The problem is called the variant of unknown significance problem. I alluded to that as well when we talked about genetic testing for cancer susceptibility. So if we do BRCA1 testing, you can find a mutation that's previously been associated with cancer. You can find a mutation in a family member that has previously been associated with cancer, but you can also find a variant in that gene that's never been reported before. And you can't, with a straight face, look at the patient and say, you are at risk for cancer or not. So we have this variant of uncertain significance problem, which is going to be an enormous problem as people start to do sequencing. So this is Steve Quake's family tree. You can see he's indicated by the arrow in the middle and he has a father and an uncle who have coronary disease and aortic aneurysms, interestingly both of them, so that probably has a genetic basis. But what's interesting is his first cousin, cousin number 2, who has this disease called arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, ARVD. And whats much more disturbing is that one of that cousin's sons, so Steve Quake's nephew, died suddenly, presumably, of that disease, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. That's a disease where the disease genes are known. And when you look down the list of rare variants that Steve Quake has, one of the rare variants is in a gene called Desmoplakin,and he has a Desmoplakin variant that's never been seen before. So does that mean he has the disease, or does that mean he carries the same gene as his nephew, and his nephew had something else that made him have the disease, and the patient will not get the disease? Or is this a completely irrelevant finding? So even in the very first genome, whose annotation was reported, we have all the problems around this. Do you tell him this? Of course, he wanted to know everything. What do you do with this? How much do you investigate whether he has this disease? If he has the disease, do you treat him? There's not much treatment for this particular form of cardiomyopathy, but they are susceptible to serious arrhythmias and there are ways of predicting that. So the question then becomes what do you do with these variants of uncertain significance? And it's going to be an enormous problem. Here's another problem, and that is the problem of variants that predict really severe disease that is untreatable. The picture on the right is the famous folk singer, Woody Guthrie, who died of Huntington's Disease, a disease of progressive dementia that develops in people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, and is currently untreatable. His son, Arlo Guthrie, probably does not have the disease because he has not been found to have the disease and he's old enough now. So [COUGH] sequencing raises all kinds of interesting questions. If you go out and have your entire genome sequenced, one of the questions you should ask is, well, how many variants do I have, that's an interesting question. But what about variants that actually mean something to me? The term we use, actionable. So are there actionable variants that suggest I shouldn't get certain drugs, that suggest I should get higher or lower doses of certain drugs, that suggest if I have a disease I should get drug A instead of drug B. Do I have variants that change my risk for certain diseases a lot? Do I have variants that change my risk for disease a little bit? Do I really need to know about that? Do I have anything that might affect my health? Do I have anything that might affect the way my body responds to the environment? What kind of evidence do I need to have in order to change the way I behave? Do I need a randomized clinical trial for every single genetic variant? That's probably not going to happen. Is it good enough to have an anecdote? That's probably not good enough either. Do I need to understand the underlying biology, and then have a genetic association, and together that somehow drives me to change the way I behave? That's sort of the way we do things a lot with pharmacogenetics right now. We understand the biology and we have some outcome data. So we say that certain patients should get adjusted doses of warfarin, or certain patients should have higher or lower doses of clopidogrel, or some other platelet inhibiting drug. And, then, what do you do if you find that you have a genetic variant that predisposes to a disease? Do you take protective measure against that disease? What happens if that disease is fatal and untreatable, in the case of Huntington's? Do you really want to know? Do you not want to know? And if you find out and you say, well, I don't want to know, what about other members of your family? Maybe they do want to know. Or if you say I want to know, but your sister doesn't want to know, what do you do about that? And when you think about the role that genetics plays in disease susceptibility across life, there is a group of people who think that the right time to do sequencing at the whole genome level is at birth. And that you archive the information and they use it as time goes on. So when somebody is exposed to clopidogrel, you can look up their CYP2C19 genes. But the problem there is going to be the problem of the variant of uncertain significance. We all have many of those variants, and we're just now beginning to understand the fact that they're much more prevalent, and those diseases are probably much less penetrant than we gave them credit for. And how to act on those in a sequencing environment is going to be an interesting question that the field is going to have to work on. So, I show this slide at the end of this to bring us full circle from where I started the course. And, that is, part of the personalized medicine attitude has to be, first of all, it's not only about genomics, but about many, many other things that affect what makes you a human being, and makes you respond to your healthcare needs. An ability to read. An ability to be able to take 20 different medicines, some of them once a day, some of them three times a day, some of them as needed. You may have particular cultural attitudes towards disease susceptibility or disease treatment. You may have variable access to the electronic tools that many of us are going to need to keep track of this information. And you may have personal attitudes that change the way in which you want to respond to information like whole genome sequences. So, at the end of the day, personalized medicine has to involve engagement of the individual whose medicine is being personalized, the patient, as well as a healthcare system that helps understand what those variations mean. [NOISE] [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/personalizedmed/lecture/ySyt1/where-we-are-now","Where We Are Now","[MUSIC] Well, what I want to do today is review a little bit about where we have been, and the kinds of concepts that I've tried to show you in various areas in personalized medicine using the cases. So one of the very first things that people think about when we think about the concept of personalized medicine is using genetic information or other information that we have about a patient to pick the best drug and pick the best dose of that drug for the patient. And so, one of the big areas in which people are thinking about using personalized medicine is in choosing drug therapies appropriately for patients. Why do we have variability in drug action, is one of the questions that we've been addressing and there's variability, as I've talked about before, in drug metabolism, in the targets with which drugs interact to cause their effects. And in other kinds of variability, and the biology in which the drugs act, and one of the questions we have to ask ourselves is, when is this clinical useful? So this is a slide that I showed very early on during this course, and the question is, out of a population of patients when you're dealing with a specific patient, the question is not what happens to the population, but what's going to happen to that particular patient, when you expose them to the drug, would they have a great response? Would they have no response? Would they have some kind of little side effect or will they have some catastrophic side effect? And as I reviewed with you before they're many many reasons that we have variability in drug action. Age, sex, ancestry are part of it. Did we get the diagnosis right? Is the disease that is being treated or some other disease that the patient has, because patients often have more than one disease. Affect how the drug works, is the patient taking many drugs that might interact with each other, are there other things in the environment that might affect the way the drug works? Diet, pollution, stress, those sorts of things. A big deal is whether the patient actually takes the medicine. If the patient doesn't take the medicine, the medicine's not going to do very much. Did the patient actually get the medicine prescribed at the right dose and at the right time? And then there's genetics, so there are many, many factors that go into variability of drug action. Genetics is one of them. I'm showing you this before, this is a slide that shows the distribution of CYP2D6 genotypes across a population. This happens to be a Caucasian population because the distributions are different, depending on ancestry. Again 7% of the populations some are poor metabolizers. They're compound heterozygous or homozygous for loss of function alleles in this gene. And then there's this small group of people who are ultra rapid metabolizers because they have more that one copy, more than one functional copy of the gene. So this raises this idea, this idea of high-risk pharmacokinetics. And one scenario for high-risk pharmacokinetics is, you have a Pro-drug, and it has to be bioactivated, and it's bioactivated through a single pathway. And if that single pathway is deficient because of poor metabolism or because of an inhibiting drug, then the drug won't do what it's supposed to do. Tamoxifen and codeine are examples of pro drugs that require bioactivation through CYP2D6. Clopidogrel which I've talked about also requires bioactivation through CYP2C19. The other high risk for pharmocokinetic scenario is when the parent drug is active but it is metabolized, it's bio-inactivated through a single pathway. And if that single pathway is absent because of poor metabolism and inhibiting drug, or perhaps the pathway is renal excretion and the patient has kidney failure. Then you'll have the scenario with the parent drug will accumulate, and you will get excess drug effect. Warfarin, azathloprine, many 2D6 substrates, particularly those used in neuropsychiatry, fall into this category. Notice here I've used the term narrow therapeutic index and I want to go back and actually talk about what the therapeutic index is for a second. So when we give a drug, when we give a dose of a drug to a group of patients we can actually create what's called a dose response curve. With increasing doses we see more and more patients responding, and this is a efficacy dose response curve. And you can see that as the doses increase the number of patients responding increases. And you can say, well the dose or concentration producing 50% efficacy is marked by that blue arrow there. Now when we give increasing doses of a drug to a large group of patients, we'll also expect to see side effects at some point. Now here's the dose concentration curve those response group for toxicity or for adverse events for this particular drug. Now you can see that there's a very wide separation between the doses required for efficacy in this population, and the doses required for toxicity. We talk about that as a wide therapeutic index drug but a great drug would be a drug that has very few side effects. The side effects that occur are nuisance side effects they're not life threatening and maybe they don't occur in everybody. So a wide therapeutic index drug. That's an example there. What we encounter more often then, and where the genetics part becomes interesting and important, is if those two curves are very close to each other. Notice the way I've drawn it here, not every single patient gets efficacy, but everybody at some dose will always get toxicity. And there's a big overlap between the doses or concentrations required to produce efficacy and those required to produce toxicity. So that's what's called a narrow therapeutic index drug. In the case of variable genetics, all that the genetics will do is move you In some way toward toxicity, in a way from efficacy. So it's in the situation where the toxicity is serious and occurs at doses or concentrations quite close to those producing efficacy that we worry about genetic variation. Clopidogrel and warfarin are great examples because the toxicity is serious bleeding and the lack of efficacy is serious thrombosis. So you really want to balance between those two and if the genetics pushes you one way or the other, that can mean the difference between efficacy and toxicity. So that's the concept of the therapeutic index. So there are other ways besides drug metabolism that can affect the way in which we respond to drugs. This is a genome-wide association study, you've seen many of these before. This is with 22 cases and a very large number of controls looking for Stevens-Johnson syndrome with carbamazepine, in this particular example. And recall that Stevens-Johnson syndrome is this really terrible skin and tongue reaction, and this can be fatal. And as you see on the bottom, HLA variants predict Stevens-Johnson syndrome with carbamazepine, as I showed you on the previous slide. And also with this drug Abacavir that's used in anti-retroviral therapy, with odds ratios that are in the hundreds, so that's a huge effect of a single allele that's not related to drug metabolism, it's rather related to the way in which the body responds to the drug, as I've talked about in a module that dealt with HLA. So one of the things that we worry about when we see variable drug actions is the extent to which genetics contributes. And one of the questions that we have to ask ourselves when we see and when we define genetic variability is when is it clinically useful? And I think the answers to that is, it's clinically useful, if getting the dose wrong, or getting the concentration wrong will produce serious toxicity or serious lack of efficacy. And as in the case of drugs like warfarin or clopidogrel, or toxicity with codeine because of ultra rapid metabolism or toxicity with antidepressants because of lack of an anti-depressant effect and worsening depression. And the other part of knowing the genetics is knowing what to do with the information. If we get a genetic variant and we know that's important for the drug. Does that mean we should switch to another drug? Does that mean we should increase the dose or lower the doses? There's lots of work that has to be done after we define a genetic pathway. That defines what to do with that information in the real world. And we'll come back to that in a later module when we talk about implementation. So another area in which I've spent some time talking about the genetics is using genetics to refine the way in which we define disease. So we can take diabetics and treat all diabetics the same, or we can understand that there are certain subtypes of diabetes. Pretty rare right now, but the hope is that we'll do a better job in the future at certain subtypes that respond to particular drug therapies, because they have different mechanisms that drive them to the common phenotype of diabetes. So that's one way in which genetics can become important, in terms of defining drug mechanisms. The other way is, many, many examples that I've shown you In which we use information around the genetics of disease susceptibility and disease causation. To actually identify new therapies that will be useful [COUGH] in patients with specific genetic abnormalities that drive the development of those diseases. So here are some examples that I've shown you before. Across the top are four mouse hearts from mouse model of Marfan syndrome. The one on the left is a normal mouse heart showing the normal ascending aorta. The second one is a mouse heart that has Marfan syndrome and has been treated with nothing no say they have ascending aortic aneurisms as do the patients. Treating the mice with propranolol does not very much to that ascending aortic aneurism, but understanding the role of TGF beta signaling in Marfan syndrome led investigators to think that maybe we should inhibit TGF signalling, using losartan, the angiotensin receptor blocker. And when you do that in those mice, they do not develop the ascending aortic aneurysm. So that means understanding the mechanism of the disease can lead to new therapies. In this case, with a drug that's long established and well understood. The cystic fibrosis example, there are many many subtypes of cystic fibrosis. Some of them due to abnormal function of that protein. Some of them do the normal function of the protein that just never gets to the cell surface. So once you understand the subtypes then you can start to develop specific drug therapies that target the abnormalities for those sub-types. And there's this drug ivacaftor, which is now available for certain types of cystic fibrosis in which the problem is that the channel doesn't gate properly. And then the last example, those hands are the hands of a patient with severe familial hypercholesterolemia, and I've talked a lot about how understanding the mechanisms in that disease led to the development of statin therapies. And is also leading to the development of other therapies that target the lipid pathways using genetic models to understand what the targets should be. So that's ways in which genetics is informing better therapies and better subdividing of patients with common diseases. The other way in which genetics is having an enormous impact is in cancer. We understand now that cancer is a disease of the genome and it takes multiple genetic abnormalities to drive the development of cancer. Some patients have germ line DNA variants, often in tumor suppressor genes and those can accelerate the development of cancer. Understanding those drivers as I talked about before. Is enabling new drug therapies and new classifications schemes that are based not what the pathologist sees under the microscope. But on what the pathologist is able to do with genetic information, with transcriptional information, with protein expression information to subclassify disease and predict what drugs are going to work and what drugs are not going to work. So we talked a little bit about germline variance and BRCA one. Talked about the case of Angelina Jolie. Germline variants that predisposed to colon cancer and the Lynch syndrome. And then the idea that malignant melanoma can be subdivided not by where it arises in the body and whether there's Sun damage there but, what the genetics are and one of the common variances B R A F, BRAF, V600E. And I've talked about how the development of understanding of the role of that particular variant in driving the melanoma phenotype has lead to the development of drugs that specifically inhibit that abnormal kinase activity. And the interesting part is that there are other tumors, hairy-cell leukemia, certain forms of thyroid cancer, that also respond to V600E inhibition, and that turns out to be a great example of how subclassifying disease based on what you can understand from the genome and not what you send to the microscope might lead to new therapies. And then the last area that I want to just review is the distinction that I have made and that many people make between common and rare variation in the genome and the effect that has on the way in which we develop disease or the way in which we respond to drugs. So, I've talked about many examples of familial diseases, they're shown here, Sickle Cell Disease, Cystic Fibrosis, the Long QT Syndrome, Familial Hypercholesterolemia Marfan Syndrome. And in each of those cases, the way in which people went about solving the problem was to study families. So you study families, you identify the gene and then you can put a dot on a graph like this that explains the relationship between allele frequency in a population and effect size. So this dot for these rare familial diseases is way up in the upper left-hand corner. That means the alleles are very, very rare, but when they occur, they have very large effect sizes. Sometimes not 100% penetrants, but pretty close, and they cause very severe diseases. The other end of the spectrum is the Is the genome wide association paradox. So if you have a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia, or a patient with a really, really long QT interval, you can use the family to get to that. But the other way to get to genes that control cholesterol, or the QT interval, is to study large populations. These are two graphs actually from our own bio bank, which I'll talk about In a couple of modules that describe the distribution of LDL cholesterol in almost 50,000 patients, describe the distribution of the QT interval in more than 30,000 patients and you can see there's a normal distribution. So one of the things we can use, techniques like genome wide association to address, is what is it that makes somebody be in one end of that tail of values compared to the other tail. What puts people in the extremes, or, and notice that most people are in the middle. So we can use GWAS to get at that question, and sometimes that informs what happens in the rare diseases. And I've talked about this technique before and I've talked about how we've used GWAS to study hair color and to study atrial fibrillation susceptibility, macular degeneration, the ability to smell urine after eating. To detect the abnormal smell of asparagus in your urine after eating asparagus. So those are all the kind of traits that people have used to have been studied using the genome-wide association study paradigm. And when we do that, we come up with a dot that's at the opposite end of this plot. The dot is now in the lower right-hand corner. The alleles we discovered through genome wide association are generally common, usually with a minor or low frequency greater than 5% because that's the way the experiment is set up. It's set up to study those alleles and the effect size is very, very modest, so modest in fact that people have criticized the technique of genom-wide association because they say, well, you come up with something that increases the odds of me getting a disease by 50% and that's not anything I'm going to do anything about, so what's the point? And I think I've made the point before that you discover new knowledge through this approach as well. So we now have these two extremes, one based on studying families with rare phenotypes, the other based on studying populations. And they've now replaced the dots with the little symbols, but the real question is what's going on in the middle? And that's where the real excitement In modern genetics and as it applies to personalized medicine is really coming. Because we're beginning to understand, I think, and I've given you examples along the way, how rare and common variation together they conspire to cause a phenotype. So for example, there is this story around the gene called NOS1AP, which turns out to be a major modulator of the QT interval in a GWAS study. And you can say well, a variant in NOS1AP produces a two millisecond increase in the QT interval, and that's not interesting or important to me. But it turns out those common variants also determine the penetrance, or the severity of the long QT syndrome among people who have the rare variance that caused that disease. So it's the combination of the two that predispose to getting the severe disease or getting the milder disease. We're very interested now because the technology is enabling in studying rare variance perhaps with an allele frequency of maybe one in a thousand to one in a hundred and there are many examples now of alleles like that that have large effect sizes. One example that I talked about was SOC 30A8 variants and the idea of protecting against diabetes. So by discovering variants that are relatively rare, they're not as rare as the family things and not as common as GWAS, relatively rare with large effect sizes, we may be able to subdivide patients better and we may be able to devise better therapies based on using those genes that the protein product drug targets. And then there's the idea that common variation, particularly, common variation combined with the environment may conspire to produce large phenotypic effects. And of course, the best example there is the environmental influence of drugs so you take a drug and you may have a variable effect due to a common variant in a drug metabolism gene like CYP2D6 or CYP2C19. That variant does nothing to you in the absence of the drug, so it's the drug plus the common variant that conspire to produce the phenotype. So the future for personalized medicine I think will be in the further definition of these areas using newer sequencing technologies in a large population. [SOUND] >> [APPLAUSE]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nonprofit-gov-3/lecture/qMGy1/course-3-overview-video","Course 3 Overview Video","[MUSIC] Hi, Professor Yvonne Harrison here from the Department of Public Administration and Policy at the University at Albany. Welcoming you to the third course in a series of courses on developing leadership, and improving governance in nonprofit organizations. In this video, I will review Course 3. Introduction to the factors that influence the effectiveness of the governance process. I will begin with the learning outcomes and the leadership competencies emphasized, along with the learning activities that you will engage in each week. I'll conclude with an assessment of learning that will take place in the fourth and fifth week. By the end of this course, you will have developed knowledge of the factors associated with the effectiveness of the governance process. You will have worked with the board of directors, or with information gathered from a board of directors to identify a set of best practice recommendations that will help the board improve its governance effectiveness. And finally, you will have applied knowledge and developed skills as nonprofit leaders. This course is designed to introduce you to the leadership competencies required by academic programs that are accredited by NASPAA. And NASPAA is the network of schools of public affairs in North America. This course emphasizes 2 NASPAA leadership competencies, to analyze and think critically about leadership and governance effectiveness challenges, and to lead and participate in the governance process. It should be noted that this course was developed with North American requirements in mind. And we do appreciate that the nonprofit sector, nonprofit organizations, leadership and governance may not be the same in other parts of the world. It is our intention, however, that the course content will be of value to others, and that cultural differences will provide a rich forum for discussion. Now, turn to the topics and questions addressed in this course. The topic of Week 1 is board meetings, structures, and procedures. Some of the questions we will explore this week are, what factors influence the effectiveness of nonprofit board meetings? What are board structures and procedures, and why are they important? Why do boards experience problems with inadequate procedures and structures? And what could a board do to intentionally change its meetings, its procedures, and structures to increase its effectiveness. In Week 2, the topic is composition, and development of the board. The key questions you will explore this week are, what do we mean by board composition and development, and why is it important? Why is it difficult to change the composition of the board? And how do you design the ideal mix of board members? How do you locate, recruit, and develop the board? The topic of Week 3 is the informal culture and leadership of the board. The key questions you will explore this week are, what do we mean by culture, board culture, and why is it important? How do boards develop, and pass along culture? What shapes culture, and can it be changed? Some of the leadership questions are, what is leadership in the context of governing? What do effective nonprofit leaders involved in governance do? Why are some leaders more effective than others? And how can leadership be managed for higher levels of effectiveness? Within the platform, you'll find weekly lectures, videos, readings, and links to external resources that point you to important content. Once you're reviewed the content, you're ready to engage in the learning activities. Take a practice quiz. Based on the required content, the quiz is a chance to test your knowledge, and further develop it. Because it is a practice assessment, your scores will not be counted into the final course grade. Post a commentary. Commentaries can be based on an insight from the readings that helped you understand a situation, or event that you have experienced. Anything from the reading that you found confusing, or unclear could also be posted. Remember, the basic goal is to help you connect the dots, by linking your ideas and questions on the topic, drawing on what you've learned from the readings, and applying it to your own experience. Analyze a nonprofit case. A case is based on a real world situation. Like the real world, there is usually no single correct answer to the issues they raise. The cases assigned in this course are intended to provide you with a chance to reflect and apply concepts from the course, as well as enable you to understand and resolve practical problems in governance. Work on the course project. The course project is an academic service learning experience that provides you with an opportunity to apply the course content and your learning to help a real board develop leadership, and improve governance effectiveness. Whether you gather information from a real board, or you use the information that we gathered, we'll upload instructions, and information that you'll need to complete the work associated with a course project. The end of course assessment of learning will take place in the fourth and fifth week. The first assessment of learning strategy comes from Michaelsen's method of teaching and learning, known as Team-Based Learning. TBL is used to test mastery of course concepts using readiness assurance tests, and application exercises. In the fourth week, we'll open two multiple choice readiness assurance tests or RATs as we will humorously refer to throughout the course for you to complete. One RAT will assess knowledge base on reading comprehension, and the other will test knowledge application based on a case. In the fifth week, we will encourage you to discuss the RATs in the forums, and to take them again, should you wish to change any of your answers based on the information exchanged. We chose this method of assessment because it is associated with student learning including concept comprehension, student motivation, communication, accountability, problem-solving, and superior academic performance. The second assessment of learning is the Board Effectiveness Assessment Reflection, which we will humorously refer to as the BEAR. In a nutshell, the board is a short written reflection on the nonprofit board and organization you are working with. You will be asked to analyze information, and communicate the results of the board's effectiveness assessment to the board. Your assignment should show the board's top 10 strengths and challenges, along with perceptions of board effectiveness in the nine dimensions assessed. From your review in the literature, what best practices and other practical recommendations can be applied to improve the effectiveness of the board you have been working with? Be creative in how you communicate results, and present recommendations. Use tables, and charts to tell the board's story. Be sure to include an introduction to the reflection, and a description of how it's organized. In the fifth week, you'll be asked to peer review BEAR assignments. To receive a course grade you must complete peer reviews. In this video, we've reviewed Course 3, introduction to the factors that influence the effectiveness of boards of directors within the governance process. We've reviewed the learning outcomes, the leadership competencies, the topics and key questions, and the learning activities you'll explore each week. We've also discussed the end of course assessment of learning, which will take place in the fourth and fifth week. For more information, refer to the course content. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nonprofit-gov-3/lecture/w8UZa/specialization-welcome-video","Specialization Welcome Video","[MUSIC] >> Hi, I'm Professor Yvonne Harrison from from the Department of Public Administration and Policy at the University at Albany. Along with my colleague Professor Vick Murray of the School of Public Administration at the University of Victoria. And Alina Roddick, instructional designer at Empire State College, we wanna welcome you to this series of courses on developing leadership and improving governance in nonprofit organizations. By registering for one or more of the courses in this series, you are part of a University at Albany and an Open SUNY innovative instructional technology grant. To increase access to non-profit management and leadership education. In this video, I'll describe why we decided to develop a series of courses on leadership and governance in non-profit organizations. How the series is structured and the learning within it organized. And what you can do to get the most value out of each course. I'll conclude with our role and some ground rules for engagement. Again, thank you for registering and welcome. Why did we develop a series of courses on developing leadership and improving governance in non profit organizations? Well, we decided to develop a course on improving leadership in governance and nonprofit organizations for several reasons. One, I've been teaching this course on site for many years, and I've also taught it online, and it meets the curricular guidelines for nonprofit management and leadership education. Two. This course contains new methods of teaching and learning, academic service learning, and team based learning that have been associated with student development and success. Three. This course also connects to our research on nonprofit governance and leadership and through this research we've been able to develop a number of open tools and resources for nonprofit boards and organizations to improve their leadership and governance effectiveness. And finally, it emphasizes a number of leadership competencies that are required by schools of public affairs that are credited by NSPA. And NSPA is the Network of Schools of Public Affairs in North America. How is the series structured and the learning within each course organized? We've organized the series in three short courses. Each course examines a specific topic, set of questions, and concepts. The first course provides a theory and background to the non-profit sector, non-profit organizations, and the concepts of leadership and governance. The second course focuses on the role and responsibility of non profit boards of directors in the governance process. And finally, the third course examines factors that had been associated with the effectiveness of boards within the governance process. Each course is further broken down into 5 weeks. During weeks 1 through 3, you will be encouraged to review content, take a practice quiz, reflect on a board case, and post a commentary in the discussion forums. You will also find guidance on the service learning assignment where you will have the opportunity to apply your knowledge to a real world, non-profit governance and leadership situation. Learning will be assessed during the fourth and fifth weeks. During the fourth week you will be asked to submit a written assignment and take two short multiple choice tests. One test will assess course knowledge, while the other assesses application of knowledge within a practical case. In week five, you'll have the opportunity to discuss the test, and to take them again, should you wish to change any of your answers. We'll count the highest test scores into your final course grade. How do you get the most value out of each course? We believe you'll get the most value if you register for each course in the series and you download the required texts and complete all of the learning activities. This is especially important if you plan to use this for continuing education or to earn core certificates. Finally, let me say a few words about our role and some rules for engagement. We've taken the role as facilitators of learning. Bringing to you into one place, the latest knowledge and research on a complex subject. All of the people involved are experts in their field, and are donating time for a cause they believe in. And that's increasing access to non-profit management and leadership education. And finally, I'd just like to go over some rules for engagement. As we launch this series of courses on Coursera's new on demand platform, don't be surprised if there are a few technical difficulties. We're depending on you to communicate those issues to us, so that we can respond to them. We ask that when you do communicate those, you recommunicate them professionally and be respectful of the people involved. In fact, in all interactions in this online community, we ask that you try to emphasize the leadership confidences that we're trying to develop in this course. And most of all, have fun. I want to thank you for registering and we look forward to seeing you each week. [MUSIC] [BLANK AUDIO]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/prresearch/lecture/91DBV/research-methods-in-pr-part-2-quantitative-and-qualitative-research-methods","Research Methods in PR Part 2 - Quantitative and Qualitative Research Methods Introduction","[SOUND] Welcome back. In Part One, you learned what formal and informal information, and what primary and secondary research means. In this part two, we will learn about how you would collect primary formal information and why. There are two qualitative research methods that a pr practitioner would use. First, is an interview. These are often used in person and are useful at formative stages of research. Second is focus group. These are often used to probe range of ideas, to pilot test ideas and messages. There are two quantitative research methods that a pr practitioner could use- surveys and content analysis. Surveys are conducted in various ways such as face to face, mail in, telephone, or on the web. Content analysis are used to monitor the media, scan the environment, and analyze documents. I will discuss the detail of each of these research methods in module three. Before we end this lesson, let's try some questions. In order to move PR from technical to management function, strategic decision-making should be supported by formal primary research. This is true. Formal research is based on systematic way of collecting information. Primary research is information that you collect yourself based on the needs identified. Formal primary research then, provides evidence to support strategic decisions. Research makes PR strategic, substantiates decisions, and allows you to show results. This is also true. Research helps you strategize the best action to take to solve an issue, substantiate the recommendations you make in terms of the best actions. Allows you to make informed decision when taking an action and can be used to show ineffective or effectiveness of an action. Research methods in PR should be driven by what the goal of the research is. This is true. Each method comes with its own strength and weaknesses. A PR practitioner must understand what information is needed and why. This will define how that information is best collected which will lead you to choose the best method to collect that information. This brings us to the end of Module 1 on introduction to public relations research. This module covered the importance of research in PR by examining how PR research is similar to and different from academic research. The takeaway from this module is the significance of research in PR that helps move PR practice from a technical to a management function. I also provide an overview of the research methods that can be used in PR research. Which we will discuss in detail in module three. But first, in module two, you will learn the importance, the significance, and how to conduct formative research.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/prresearch/lecture/n4cIn/research-methods-in-pr-part-1-information-collection","Research Methods in PR Part 1 - Information Collection","[NOISE] This fourth section will help you decide what combination of information you want to collect when conducting research in PR. This lesson will be divided into two parts. In Part One I will cover what formal and informal information and what primary and secondary research means. In Part Two I will cover how you would collect primary and formal information and why. Can you use information someone else has already collected to help you make strategic decisions, or do you have to collect your own information to make strategic decisions? Before you decide which research method is best, when you need to keep three things in mind. Do you need formal or informal information? Do you need conduct primary or secondary research? Do you use qualitative or quantitative method to collect information you need? Formal research is structured and systematic method of analyzing, collecting and analyzing information you collect. It is systematically structured because formal research carefully follows prescribed rules and steps. In module three, I will discuss in detail formal primary research in PR. Informal research occurs ad hoc and without any agreed upon rules and procedures. In PR, informal information may be collected from key informants, community forums, personal contact, and advisory boards. Primary research means any data collected by the practitioner or the researcher for a particular purpose. When you design a research using qualitative or quantitative method you are collecting primary data. Primary data, depending on whether it is research in PR or research on or for PR, become propriety, or public information. Some of the ways you could use primary research are to understand perception of the organization, attitude towards the organization and the issue, test ideas and messages, understand how to reach your target publics, monitor the media and social media, and understand how people respond to your PR activities. While primary research allows you to collect focused and tailored information that addresses your specific needs, it tends to be time consuming, expensive, and in need of well trained personnel. However, you have control over the depth and quality of the information. And such, allows you to demonstrate the value and worth of your decisions. Secondary research is data that has been collected by someone else, but the PR practitioner may use it for their own purpose. Secondary data can be internal, such as communication audit, environmental scanning, that becomes the basis of identifying needs and issues. Can also be external, such as journals and books that discusses best practices and market research. While secondary research is less time consuming, cost-effective, you have no control of the quality of information, methods used, validity of the data, and may not meet your specific objectives and needs. Next, in Part Two, I will give you an overview of what research methods would help you, a PR practitioner, conduct primary formal research.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/prresearch/lecture/HPzya/applied-vs-academic-research-part-3-research-contribution","Applied vs Academic Research Part 3 - Research Contribution","In parts one and two, you learned why we conducted research and what we do with the information once it's collected. In part three I will explain why collecting and sharing of the information matters and to whom it matters. What contributions do academic and applied research make? What impact can the information have? Academic research leads to building knowledge, introducing new theory or testing an existing one. Applied research informs program planning, allows refinement of existing programs, primarily ensuring problem solving and issue management. The contribution of academic research on and for PR is to provide a greater understanding of PR as a field in terms of best practices and theoretical ideas. Although research in PR is programmatic, based on continuous assessment, it is dependent on the need and objectives of the organization, which means the research is centered around program planning, designing, implementing and evaluating. This is what you learned as programmatic research. The MBO process, the continual practice of proactive PR that enables PR to become part of the management function of strategic decision making. Before we end this lesson, let's try a few questions. Applied research depends on the client and/or organizational need. This is true. Applied research is PR practitioners conducting research driven by the need of the organization or the public. Applied research is focused on practical solutions and academic research is aimed at expanding knowledge. This is also true. Needs-driven research is focused on solving a problem, an issue, while the main purpose of academic research is to discover, to explain and expand what we already know. Applied research allows strategic planning of communication strategies to address issues. This is also true. The main purpose of applied research is to anticipate problem before they become a crisis. Most tended to be reactive, but the modern public relation management function is grounded in research. This is the end of lesson. In the next lesson we will learn about research methods.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/prresearch/lecture/zIm8C/applied-vs-academic-research-part-2-interpretation-and-information-use","Applied vs Academic Research Part 2 - Interpretation and Information Use","[SOUND] In part one of Applied versus Academic Research, you learned about the agenda and goals that differentiate academic and applied research. In part two, I will explain what happens after you have collected the information. What does an academic do with it? What does a PR practitioner do with it? Specifically, I will discuss the interpretation and use of the information. What do you do once you have the information you wanted? Academic Research focuses on theoretical implications and Applied Research focuses on practical recommendations that are aimed to solve a problem, an issue. Once the research is completed that allows you to define a PR problem to formative research what do you do next? In the case of Nestle Lactose-free, a formative research is followed by stage two which allows you to strategize, how best to address this issue you have identified as necessary to be resolved. Stage three is next, when action is taken to implement the strategy. Followed by stage four, a summative evaluation at the end of the program to measure impact an effectiveness of your efforts. While academic research would end with suggestions and recommendations for best practices as well as new theoretical ideas. Applied research would aim to solve problems. Now, that you have made sense of the information you have collected through the interpretations you made, what do you do with the information? Who has access to the information collected through research? The findings of an Academic Research are public in nature. It is often shared through publications while Applied Research that is generated by an organization to address a particular issue is proprietary information and as such is not public knowledge. The findings of Academic Research are often shared through publications such as journals, books, articles, and sometimes through different media outlets. Proprietary information is trade secrets and will stay within the organization. The information you may find when you search Google with the keywords about the Nestle India crisis for example, are going to be information based on research conducted by a researcher. You may find statements from Leslie PR about their research findings, but unlike Academic Research the data isn't going to be available for the public to access and use. In part three, I will explain the significance of Applied and Academic Research.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/prresearch/lecture/DvjYe/applied-vs-academic-research-part-1-agenda-and-goals-of-research","Applied vs Academic Research Part 1 - Agenda and Goals of Research","[SOUND] I explained in research in PR Part one and two, the differences between three types of PR research. Research on and for PR, which is academic. While research in PR, which is applied. Research in PR is what practitioners use and is understood as applied research. Whenever I discuss PR research here on, I am referring to research in PR, which is applied research. Research that you, as a PR practitioner would conduct. What then is academic and applied research? At the end of this section, you will learn the five major differences between academic and applied research. These five major differences are broken down into three videos. Part one will focus on two major differences, agenda and goals of the research. Why do we conduct research? The agenda of conducting research differs. An academic research is often driven by the interest of the researcher. An applied research is needs driven that addresses a specific situation that has to be addressed. Let's go back to June 2015, Nestle Maggi noodles recall. The Food and Drug Administration in India declared batches of Maggi sent for testing as unsafe. The news that Maggi was recalled in India with many other countries banning it went viral on social media. Nestle admits that recall crisis could have been adverted had Nestle been proactive in its communication with the government and regulatory bodies. During a crisis, there's an immediate need to respond. Practicing proactive PR means anticipating the problem before it happens. Researching PR for Nestle, now has to focus on amending the broken trust with it's public and such as Reactive PR. Proactive PR is driven by the needs of the organization to address an issue before it becomes a crisis. Academics may use Nestle as a case to test theories on the relationship between social media and crisis communication. The research agenda, therefore, is different. Another example is proactive applied research driven by need, for instance, Lactofree is your client and comes to your PR agency and asks you to plan a campaign to change public's attitude towards Lactofree dairy. And then evaluate the success or failure of this campaign. This is considered proactive PR because research is utilized to undertake tangible actions to address the organization's needs. And evaluate whether those objectives are met. In this instance, an academic researcher may conduct research for PR practitioners to train them on how to conduct research, but not to carry out any best practice research. Here, the research is driven purely by the need of the organization. First, the starting point is different and such the goals of the research also differ. Academic research explores new areas of expanding of our knowledge, while applied research is focused on problem solving. From the Nestle and Lactofree examples, you can see that research can be proactive or reactive. This will affect the communication campaign you may strategize and implement to address the issue. Either way, the goal of applied research is problem solving. Reactive research in PR for Nestle could be to identify how to address the lack of trust in Nestle's food quality. While the goal of proactive research in PR, could be to change attitude towards dairy free products. In either case, an academic researcher would be interested in best practices for PR practitioners when dealing with changing attitudes and perceptions or when rebuilding trust. The goal will be to ensure improving the practice of PR rather than problem solving specific issues. Next in part two, we will discuss the two major differences, interpretation and information use.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/prresearch/lecture/I1XgW/research-in-pr-part-1-research-on-and-for-public-relation","Research in PR Part 1 - Research ON and FOR Public Relation","[SOUND] In the introduction to PR research, you learn the objectives of this course. Along with the significance of PR research for effective and strategic communication. In this section I will discuss how PR research is similar and different from academic research. This should help you identify the importance of PR research that situates PR as a management function. When you hear PR research, it can mean three different things. Research in PR, research on PR, and research for PR. This section on research in PR is divided into two videos, so you will need to connect the topics mentioned here with the next video. At the end of part one you will know what, when and how research on and for PR is significant. At the end of part two, you will have a clear idea of the most relevant and useful type of research for a PR practitioner. Research on PR is research conducted by academic scholars. On the practice of public relations. It is often rooted in theoretical understanding. You learn PR theories in the first course. Those theories become the basis of conducting research on PR. This type of research aims to identify best practice and improve the profession. The main objective is to expand our knowledge of PR practice. Let me give you an example. A researcher may want to study how PR uses social media during a crisis. Let's take the June 2015 Nestle India Maggi noodles recall as a case. Research on PR could focus on assessing Nestle's communication efforts on Twitter during the recall crisis. Based on theory such as dialogic theory that you learned in the first course, some of the questions a researcher may ask are, did the organization adhere to the theoretical understanding of how a dialogue should occur during a crisis. Another researcher may take the same theory and ask, how public behave in social media during a crisis? That researcher may ask, how do the public respond to PR messages on social media during a crisis? Whether the focus is on the organization or the public's response are both. The aim would be to expand knowledge on how PR is practiced and how it could be further improved. In terms of improving the profession we may learn through either of those research findings, the most effective uses, response, and dialogue on social media during a crisis. Taking social media as an example to research on PR. Scholars have identified what works and what doesn't work on social media. What PR practitioners should keep in mind when using social media. What theories can explain social media's role in PR. And how best to leverage social media for PR efforts. In fact the final course in this specialization will focus on social media in public relations. Where you will explore these ideas in greater depth. Research for PR is also research conducted by academic scholars. Except, it is focused on developing new theoretical understanding of PR. This is how you came to learn about about the PR theories that were covered in the first course. Both research on and for PR are academic research. But the major difference is that research on PR uses existing theory to explain something and research for PR drives new theories and new theoretical understanding. For instance, scholars have identified best practices for crisis communication, for issue management to research on PR. While others have developed new theoretical ideas such as symmetrical communication, situation analysis, research for PR, which uses best practices with theoretical ideas that can be used in the practice of PR. In the next lesson of recession PR part two, I will walk you through research in PR. This is the research that you will conduct as a PR practitioner.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/prresearch/lecture/GQCWQ/introduction-to-pr-research","Introduction to PR Research","[SOUND] Welcome. This is the introduction to Public Relations Research, the first module in our Public Relations Research course. By the end of this module, you'll be able to learn the importance of research and PR. Know how PR research is similar to and different from academic research. You will also learn how research and PR is used as a management function, as well as have an overview of research methods used in PR research. MBO, management by objectives, is strategic foundation that drives PR. Effective MBO is framed around these four stages as you see in the following image. In this course we will focus on stage one, defining public relations problem. To define a PR problem, you will learn about formative research that helps you assess and analyze the situation to be addressed. After we walk through the steps of formative research, you will know how to define an issue and plan to address that issue through applied research. And we will also focus on Stage 4, Evaluating the Program. Summative research evaluates the impact and effectiveness of a program. After we walk through the stage of evaluation research, you will be able to design and plan evaluation research to be conducted at the end of a communication program. Stage 4 is, however, dependent on stages 2 and 3, where you strategize and implement a program to address an issue. Formative and evaluation research are vital to modern public relation management. You may wonder why research is vital for PR management. If you recall in the first course in specialization, you learned that PR is about building and maintaining long term relationships with the relevant publics. Research allows strategic planning and decision making which moves PR to a management function. Research makes communication two way by allowing you to engage with the public. Research ensures strategic communication with the public based on their needs and wants. Research allows you to measure impact of your communication efforts to show effectiveness of your program. Let's begin with talking about issue. An issue is a conflict of some sort between two parties. Issue often receives media attention. Issues can be either positive or negative. Issues can also be internal or external to an organization. Issues differ from crisis. Issues develop slowly but crisis is marked by urgency. Issues can be predicted meaning it is identified and managed. Issues allow you to practice proactive PR, and that is why MBO is significant in public relations. Before we end this lesson, let's try some questions. Public relations research is an essential component of a management function. True. Research is key in strategic decision making. Strategic decisions is part of management function. Public relations research aims to build two way communication with the public. True. One way communication means simply disseminating information from the organization to the public. Research makes communication two way allowing you to engage in a dialogue with the publics. Public relations research identifies issues, engages in problem solving, and measures impact. This is also true. This refers to the MBO process of PR. Stage one is where you identify the issue. Stage two is where you strategize how to address that issue. Stage three is where you engage the public through a program. Stage four is where you evaluated the effectiveness of your program.",""

This course is part of the Public Relations specialization. My name is Iccha Basnyat, and I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communications and New Media at the National University of Singapore. I will guide you through the next four modules on public relations research. I am a researcher whose interest lies in between pure and pragmatic research. What I mean is that research I conduct is both academic and applied. My academic research focuses on making the article contribution, and my applied research has practical implications in real life settings. I have been teaching both academic and applied research method courses at NUS for the last seven years. Academic research is directed towards expanding our knowledge, and applied research is directed at problem solving. You will become familiar with these terms and it's implications in the video titled Applied vs Academic Research. This course focuses on applied research. Such that by the end of this you will be able to, design research that it has practical application. Plan research to improve both the PR program and organization's performance. And know when and how to use qualitative and quantitative research method to solve a PR problem. To achieve these three objectives, this course is divided into four modules. The first module will provide you with an introduction to public relations research. The second module will provide you with ways to analyze and assess the situation that needs to be addressed. The third module will give you the research tools that will enable you to design and conduct research to solve a PR problem.

Nothing was as before. That was true for the non-Jewish Germans. But what about the German Jews, who at 1933 numbered about 560,000, less than 1% of the population. How did Nazism affect their lives and how did they cope with this changing world? What did they understand of their deteriorating situation? Why didn't they leave Germany as long as they could? This last question even intensifies when we learn that in the 1930s Nazi Germany did whatever it could in order to force German Jews to leave the country. A review of the numbers of Jews who indeed left Nazi Germany in the 30s show that the number of immigrants grew slightly in 1933, only to decline in 34 and 35, grew again slightly in 36 and increased dramatically only in 1938. Not less surprising, those figures show that, unlike German Jews, the Austrian Jews fled their country in tens of thousands as soon as it was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938. So, how can this be explained? Let's try and better understand what German Jews went through in the 30s, keeping in mind what we have already learned about the events in Nazi Germany. As soon as Hitler came to power, numerous anti-Jewish legislative actions were taken. On April 1st, 1933, a boycott of Jewish businesses. On the 7th of April, the law for restoration of the professional civil service. And later in that month a decree limiting the number of Jewish pupils in schools and a law against Jewish ritual slaughter. Quite intensive, but now let's look carefully into those regulations, their implementation, and the way they were understood by German Jews at the time. The boycott of Jewish businesses was almost a total failure from the Nazi perspective. Not only that its immediate impact ebbed away in a short time. Even during the day of boycott, many non-Jewish Germans simply didn't obey it. Less than three months after the changing of the regime, and despite the SR men, who stood at the entrance of Jewish stores, Germans still entered the Jewish businesses and still bought from Jews. Something will have to change in the German society before acts like this will become the norm. And what about the other decrees? The restoration of the professional civil service was mainly carried out against political enemies. Many Jewish peoples continue to attend general schools, especially in small places since there were no Jewish schools in those places and no one wanted Jewish children wandering around. And only a small segment of German Jews preserved the Jewish ritual slaughter, which meant that the law of slaughtering did not really affect them. Yet despite the small practical impact of those decrees, in them was hidden the first racial definition of Jews and others. True, the burning of the books in university and public libraries in May 10th, 1933 was not an easy sight, and many more aspects of life of the Jewish citizens were negatively affected. But those Jews saw Germany as their heimat, homeland and defined themself as German Jews. Where was their beloved country heading to? Hitler himself eliminated the extremist [FOREIGN] in mid 1934. German Jews felt and wanted to believe that things were bound to get better. The historical reality was not understood by German Jews at the time as it is here today. Actually some of those who left Germany even returned or sought to return since it seemed to them that, despite all fears, the Nazi regime was more interested in other enemies than Jews. To this trend also donated the fact that some of those who left the country suffered great poverty in their immigration destinations. The Nuremberg laws, passed in mid-September 1935, were a different story and had a shocking effect on German Jews. Nazi Germany declared Jews could not be German citizen and deprived them all civil rights granted to them in 1871. In the wake of those laws, a new, refined definition who was considered to be a Jew, and therefore no longer a citizen, was formed, at least one Jewish grandfather. And the new category of Michlinge, person of mixed blood, was created. The laws also prohibited any sexual relations between Jews and Aryans, which now became defined as rassenschande, racial shame and pollution, a retroactive communal felony which could be severely punished. And forbade Jews from rising German flag or using the national colors. This was very offensive to Jews, depriving German Jews, who saw themself as Germans no less than as Jews, from all their citizenship rights. Today we know that the Nuremberg laws were part of an ongoing attack on the Jewish legitimation in the German public sphere. Soon Jews were prohibited to take part in many realms of life and the Jewish latitude was constantly shrinking. More importantly, as people with no citizenship, private offensive initiative were always supported by the racist regime. Thus, the Nuremberg laws increased the Jewish vulnerability in the German state of society and even raised physical violence against Jews in the streets. And yet, as we look at the Jewish interpretation of those laws, we can see that the Nuremberg laws had also a reassuring affect on the Jews since now they at least know officially what to expect. Now, when things were phrased as a law, all was clear, or so they thought. While believing that the Jews as private people, and as a community, could find ways to deal with this new situation. Moreover, the deceptive silence of 1936, remember the Olympics, created an illusion that the legal attack on Jews had come to an end. But actually, in those quieter years, the Jewish section invested, the security service of the SS was established. This is where we find Adolf Eichmann, just to mention one infamous name. More and more radical steps were planned against the Jews, including intensifying Aryanization, forcing the surrender of Jewish businesses to Aryan hands. So, why didn't German Jews flee? >> From the post-Holocaust perspective one may ask why German Jews didn't leave Germany in time. Why were they so naive to stay in Germany and wait for their fate? But actually our expectation to mass emigration, the liquidation of all German Jewry by immigration, is post factum. In fact, there was a lot of immigration in the first years of the Nazi regime. But in the world of pre-Auschwitz it was a process in the long run. Jews knew already in 1933 or 1934 they don't have any future in Nazi Germany. Young people left when they could, when they found opportunities to new life abroad. They prepared for the immigration. They studied languages, they studied new professions, they made a lot of efforts to gain new opportunities overseas. As times went by, the destinations of immigrations changed. In 1933, mostly German Jews left to nearby countries in Europe, sometimes expecting the opportunity to come back after things would be settled in Germany. Zionists left to Palestine. After the laws of Nuremberg, it was quite a change in the destinations of immigration of German Jews. Realizing that they should plan it for the long run, Jews began to immigrate to much more remote destinations, Australia, even South America, places they did not know existed on the map. One should also take in account that even the Zionists, believing and having ideology that there should not be a future existence of Jews in Germany. And interpreting the Nazi rise to power as a proof to the belief, foresaw that the process of immigration of Jews from Germany will take one, two, or even three decades. Putting the mid 1960s as the time when the responsive process of immigration will take place. There's one more important consideration to take in account in understanding the way German Jews reacted and conducted immigration. From the early regime, the early time of the Nazi regime, German Jewish organizations tried to make Jewish life in Germany better, more tolerable. The same organization that took care in promoting and helping to prepare the immigration conducted social education and cultural activates which made the Jews still living in Germany more bearable. From the perspective of post Auschwitz and understanding what happened to Jews living in Germany, this was destructive. Because when the situation of Jews living in Germany under the Nazis were more bearable, when they could have some kind of social life, some kind of a cultural life, mostly in the bigger cities, mostly in Berlin, immigrations did not seem the only alternative. So in the long run, these Jews stay in Germany because of the more bearable life conditions and communal services organized, created a situation which was less emergency than before and postponed immigration for many of them. >> Between 1933 and October 37, 105,000 Jews left Nazi Germany. More that 450,000 were still living in the country. Unlike our retroactive understandings, German Jews could not see a linear development process in the anti-Jewish steps. On the contrary, things got worse, then better, then worse again, and once more became moderate. And even if a German Jew wanted to leave, taking into consideration the systematic dispossession of Jews, how could he leave and where could he have gone? The United States reduced its immigration quotas in 1924 and further tightened them in the 30s. In the land of Israel, Palestine of the time, the British mandate imposed serious immigration restrictions, especially from Spring 1936. And leaving to other countries was far from being easy, as most did not want to receive destitute Jewish refugees. Most German Jews were bound to stay. Only 1938 will make it crystal clear that Nazi Germany could not and would not enable any continuity of Jewish life. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-1/lecture/VmRQj/1938-a-major-turning-point","1938 - A Major Turning Point","[MUSIC] 1938 marks the major turning point in Nazi Germany's foreign policy as well as anti-Jewish policies. For years, Hitler tried to break the limitations imposed on Germany. As a result of the agreements at the end of the First World War and to elude the restrictions imposed on it. In 1935, Switzerland was incorporated, and in 1936, the demilitarized Rhineland was re-militarized. Although by doing so, Nazi Germany breached international agreements. Nothing practical was done to stop it. Europe people are still recovering from the trouble of the first World War, in which an entire generation of European youth was lost. World powers, and especially France and England, would have done almost anything in order to prevent another horrific World War. This included tolerating Hitler, appeasement. But not in Germany interpreted this tolerance as weakness and continued to expand its coup of influence in more militant ways. On the night between the 11th and 12th of March 1938, German troops entered Austria after weeks of enormous pressure on the Austrian governments in a series of conspiracies. They did not encounter any resistance and were welcomed with joy by many Austrians. Austria was now annexed in what was termed Anschluss, meaning integration. In days, Austrian Jews found themselves in a horrifying situation. Anti-Jewish steps, which had developed in Germany over years, were implemented in Austria within a very short period. Moreover, Nazi violence against Jews burst out in Austria in a way it never had in Nazi Germany. Adolf Eichmann was sent to Vienna and imposed brutal pressure on Austrian Jews in order to promote their immigration. In six months 45,000 Jews immigrated, and until May, 1939, more than half of the 180,000 Austrian Jews had fled. Many of them only to find themselves later on as refugees in other European countries to be occupied by Nazi Germany. At the end of September, 1938, after the so-called Munich Agreement, the German speaking Sudetenland area of Czechoslovakia was annexed to the growing Germany. Leaving the Western territories of Czechoslovakia defenseless. In March 1939, Germany overthrew the rest of Czechoslovakia, turning the Czech part into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and, Slovakia into an independent puppet state. In the same month, Memel District was Annexed. All of those expansions created what Hitler called the Greater Reich. Combining German-speaking countries into one unit. One Reich, one Volk, one Fuehrer. The Western countries watching this expansion still avoiding confronting Hitler. Hoping to prevent the unpreventable next world war. In this year, 1938, the situation of the Jews in Germany, and throughout the Reich, had become even worse. On March 28, 1938, all Jewish communities were dismantled. A month later, all Jewish property was registered. On June 15th, Jews were arrested on minor charges and sent to concentration camps. They were told that they would be released only if they could emigrate. In July 1938, the international gathering, Evian Conference was assembled to find a solution to the increasing problem of Jewish refugees from the German territories. Country after country. Representative after representative. Except for the Dominican Republic. Declared their countries had done all they could and would not accept any more Jews. This message of lack of interest in the Jewish strategy, was heard clearly in Nazi Germany. In August 1938, a new law ordered that is the 1st of January, 1939, all Jews had to add Jewish typical names to their original ones. Israel for men, Sarah for women, and later on their passports were stamped with a J. The Jewishness of German Jews could not be more exposed. Jewish lawyers and doctors were forbidden to work. And all Jewish children in small and large cities where expelled from the education system and things got even worse. The climax of the acts against the Jews occurred between November 9th and 10th in a huge program called Kristallnacht, The Crystal Night Program. During this program, which was well panned and only awaiting an excuse is often dressed in civilian clothes. Sometimes along with German citizens. Launch a void of destruction and robbery. All throughout Germany, Jews were beaten and killed. Businesses were plundered and synagogues burnt to the ground. [INAUDIBLE] joined in arresting almost 30,000 Jewish men, among them, prominent leaders who were sent to concentration camps, from which many did not return. Shortly after, on November 12, 1938 a huge financial penalty was imposed on the Jews. It was decided upon in a meeting gathered in Goering office in order to determine future steps to be taken against Jews. In it, Goering said I would not like to be a Jew in Germany. But what could those German Jews do? An interesting way to expose Jewish distress at that time is by using art as an historical tool. >> Art conserve is an essential tool to study the Holocaust. It offers a different perspective that of the human being. It's the perspective of the individual. Felix Nussbaum painted in 1939, a painting called The Refugee. Let's look at the painting together. In an empty, bare room, stands a disproportionate table, on which stands a globe. There is a shadow on the table coming from the globe. We don't see the source of light, and, we see a second shadow on the globe itself. It comes from the East. Now if we look at the corner of this big, diagonal table, we see a man sitting on a stool holding his head in despair. Next to him we see a bundle and a stick we understand this man has already wandered and he's still going on without finding a place to rest. All around him are bare walls like those of a prison but he's not in a prison. There is an entrance, or an exit. It's an arch door. But what is there outside? What do we see there. Hills, two bare trees, again bare trees, bare walls, a bare table. So we have bare trees. And we have blue sky with black birds, small, black birds. Actually, both these trees, these winter trees on which there are no more leaves and these black birds, both are recurrent motifs in Felix Nussbaum paintings. This painting expresses the very faith of Felix Nussbaum who himself, was a refugee. In 1944, he and Felka were arrested upon denunciation and taken on July 1944 on the last transport from Belgium to Auschwitz. There Felka and Felix were murdered. The story of Felix Nussbaum and the wonderful artworks he left, are exceptional tools in order to understand life during the holocaust how it was to be a persecuted Jew. But more than that, he uses his fate as a metaphor for the suffering of the Jewish people. And, it is only a glimpse to art during the holocaust, but they're so many artworks that were created either in hiding or in the ghettos or even in labor camps. All these art works tell a different story. It tells the story from within, the story of the victims. >> German Jews did not have many options to turn to, but before ask yourself, how did the other citizens of Germany, non Jews, Grasp the violence of the Kristallnacht program, let us have a short exercise from the Historian's Desk. I hope that you have already notices the rich historical infrastructure available to us. Now, I want to see that even words can change their meaning throughout time. Let's take for example one of Hitler's best known speeches given in the Reichstag on the 30th of January, 1939. And I quote, 'Today, I will once more be a prophet: if (wenn) the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevization of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation (Vernichtung) of the Jewish race in Europe'. But now, please take a close look at those words and especially at the German key word wenn. The translation has a few different meanings, if, when, once. >> Why is it important? Because this very same speech was heard by millions of Germans in 1939 as well as in later years as at the end of 1941 and on. This speech was the same, we have recordings, but its meaning changed depending on the different historical context. In 1939, people understood as if the international Jewish financiers. If, a promise. Yet in 1942 when Europe and the world where in flare in a terrible war, something else was heard. A profit. Once the international Jewish financiers. This time, the same word served as a justification for action, a demand to fulfill the promise. What about this condition of World War be fulfilled and did it have any practical meanings? We will return to this issue in the second part of our course when we'll talk about the development of the final solution. Yet for now, I just want to stress that in order to better understand history, we must carry with us this insight. No less important than determining a historical fact, is revealing what people understood of it at a relevant time and how or if this understanding changed. Keeping this in mind, let's return to the Kristallnacht. And ask how did non-Jewish German society grasp, in those days, the violent acts which swept its streets? Not very positively, actually. In the secret reports on German popular opinion mentioned before, and carefully studied by Otto Dov Kulka and Eberhard Jaeckel in their project, The Jews in the Secret Nazi Report on Popular Opinion in Germany, 1933-1945. One can find, among others, the followings, 'The Mayor of Werther reports: A large part of the population does not approve of this operation, most especially of the manner in which it was carried out'. In Bielefeld: 'On the whole, there were few objections to the destruction of the synagogues. But the manner in which Jewish shops, or the display in Jewish shop windows, were attacked, and the resulting destruction of material assets which might otherwise have passed into Aryan ownership- have generally not met with approval among the population'. In this office report, of November 1938, added, 'It was noted that this all-too-blatant action against the Jews could lead to new difficulties in foreign policy'. Nazi Germany had nothing to worry about. There were some protest against the program, by Jews and non-Jews, even by governments. And yet, those reaction did not reach a practical level, and did not damage Nazi Germany in any serious way. True, the shocking image of the Kristallnacht underlie the Kindertransport initiative. It made Great Britain willing to accept about 10,000 Jewish children from greater Reich as an emergency act. Several other thousands of Jews were allowed to enter neighboring countries. Yet, that did not change the picture. The majority of German Jewry still live in the Reich and had no where to go. The world which renounced the Jews in the Evian Conference had then very little. In Germany, the aforementioned unique reports show us, that the Kristallnacht program was not appreciated. It was not the damage done to the Jews that disturbed them, but the shattered glass and the blood in the streets, as well as the financial loss. Nazi German leadership was very attentive to those voices. Programs like Kristallnacht will not happen in Germany again. They will happen and even become a rule outside of Germany in the countries that Nazi Germany is about to conquer. This will be our main interest in the coming lesson. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-1/lecture/nXvz9/1933-1939-life-in-nazi-germany","1933-1939: Life in Nazi Germany","[MUSIC] Hello, we ended our former discussion at the end of 1933, when the unification of Nazi party and the German state seemed to be affect. Yet things are never that simple. Let us take it as an example in a memorandum written by a man called Hans von Helms on the 26th of May, 1934. Hans von Helms was an SA man with some municipal authority what could appear at first glance as an example of the integration of party and state. But, as we can see, and the full source can be found below, he was not very satisfied with the situation in mid-1934. He claims that although the identity of Party and State must be our ultimate aim, the realization of this aim is at the moment a long way off. The last few months in particular show a considerable decrease in the rate of the growth of the National Socialist influence upon the state. In his point view, things were not going the way they should. Why? Once again people are beginning to value a person's knowledge more highly than his character. Once again people are daring to defame old experienced fighters in our movement. Who have been taken into the administration for political reasons in order to form a counterweight to old, burnt-out, unreliable hangers-on. Hiring people by their skills and not by their political loyalty, and Hans von Helms concludes in a thinly veiled threat, The pillars of the Party in times of need were always the old Party fighters. This must not be underestimated!! Well, Hitler didn't like threats. And the SA, which had a part in Hitler's rise to power, started being more a burden than an asset. They were eager for power but lack discipline and their past riots in the streets, which were so important during Hitler's wave to power became a problem when he tried to present Nazi Germany to the world as a civilized country. Thus on June 30, 1934, Hitler ordered the SS to eliminate the SA leadership In what was called the Night of Long Knives. All leaders of the SA were killed, alongside some other enemies of the Nazi party, and some leading conservative figures. The removal of the SA reduced street hooliganism. More importantly, it neutralized what Hitler saw as self-destructing powers within the Nazi system. Strengthen the status of the SS and gained Hitler's support in the army, an organization whose core was built up from conservatives. A few weeks later, on August the 2nd, 1934, the old German president, Paul von Hindenburg, passed away. Hitler united the positions of counselor and that of the president, now making his party status as the Fuhrer an official, national one. This title reminds us of Hitler's view of himself as a leader, carrying a redemptive mission. Not as important on the day of Hindenburg death, the German army, soon to by called Wehrmacht, swore a personal oath of loyalty to the Fuhrer. Not to the authorized commanders, not to the protection of their homeland, but a personal oath to Adolf Hitler, the Fuhrer, the leader. Earlier we saw Hitler and the Nazi Party gain tremendous power over the German society and state. Yet at the same time, Germany acted in the field of foreign affairs, hoping it would be accepted into the family of nations despite its racial domestic conducts. The Berlin 1936 Olympics can show this aspiration clearly. The purpose was to use Olympic Games in order to demonstrate the superiority of the Aryan race and to present Nazi Germany achievements in many different fields. It was a true propaganda display with some minor problems. As when the American athlete Jesse Owens defeated the German one. From the Nazi point of view, this of course shouldn't have happened and Hitler managed to evade shaking hands with a man who proved the stupidity of the so called Aryan racial superiority. Before and during the Olympics, Nazi Germany tried to conceal it's continuous attacks on freedom. As an example, some anti-Jewish signs were removed in tourist attractions in Berlin. Though this hatred continued to be very apparent in the countryside. But, at the same time, while the Olympics were going on, the activities against Romani were intensified and hundreds of them were sent to concentration camps. Moreover, it will be a mistake to portray 1936 as being marked only by the Olympics. During this year, some future policies, which had a far reaching effect on Germany and the world were determined. The main one was the four year plan, which was supposed to prepare Nazi Germany to be self sufficient economically, socially, and militarily, and to be ready for war by 1940. Thus, enabling implementation of Nazi Germany future internal and external goals. As part of this plan, military industry increased. Which as we heard before, had an effect on concentration camp system, but also new jobs were created, as in the Autobahn highway project, or in other enterprises. Within years, the unemployment which affected millions in 1933 was gone, and a new economic policy reactivated much of the German industry. Moreover, many social innovations, such as summer vacations, were introduced and there were many more benefits to the Germans. Hence, Germans had much more social security even though freedom was harshly curbed. This was appreciated by many, thus, despite what said until now about the era, many private people actually improved their lives in Nazi Germany. Nazi Germany was a welfare state, or at least a racial welfare state. To borrow a term from an important book written by the German scholar, Gots Aly, Hitler beneficiaries plunder racial war in the Nazi welfare state. If you were not a communist, a Jew, or a Romani, things were not so bad in Nazi Germany. Actually, sometimes it even improved one's situation. Let's take, for example, the radio. Who could afford a radio before, in times of world economic crisis? Well, Nazi Germany distributed radios to its citizens, Aryan citizens, of course. Free of payment, it was all yours. There was just one little limitation. This radio did not have stations. It had names of German cities on its panel. Wherever you were in Germany, you could have your radio, but there was only one thing you could use this for, listening to Nazi propaganda. So, what was the effect of Nazism on German society? How did German citizens cope with this ongoing penetration into their private lives? This question can be answered thanks to the extensive system of secret reports on German popular opinion. It was established in order to provide the Nazi leadership with the reliable information about the prevailing popular mood and the society's reaction to the regimes taken measures. We will use those unique sources in the near future, but for now, I want to conclude this unit with a different source. Partly a late testimony, partly a work of literature. Raimund Pretzel, better known as Sebastian Haffner, opens a glimpse into the world of a German citizen in the 30's in his most recommended book, [FOREIGN]. Selected parts of it are brought in their English translation below. Adieu' had become the motto of the day- a radical leave-taking of everything, without exception. The world I had lived in dissolved and disappeared. Every day another piece vanished quietly, without ado. Every day one looked around and something else had gone and left no trace. I have never since had such a strange experience. It was as if the ground on which one stood was continually trickling away from under one's feet. Or rather as if the air when breathed was steadily, inexorably being sucked away. More unnerving was the disappearance of a number of quite harmless people who had in one way or another been part of daily life. The radio announcer whose voice had one heard every day, who had almost become an old acquaintance, had been sent to a concentration camp, and woe betide you if you mentioned his name. The familiar actors and actresses who had been feature of our life disappeared from one day to the next. Charming Miss Carola Neher was suddenly a traitor to the people. Brilliant, young Hans Otto who had been the rising star of the previous season, laid crumpled in the yard of an SS barracks. He had thrown himself out of the fourth floor window in a moment when the guard had been distracted he said. A famous cartoonist, whose harmless drawing had brought laughter to the the whole of Berlin every week, committed suicide. As did the master of ceremonies of a well-known cabaret. Others just vanished. One did not know whether they were dead, incarcerated or had gone abroad. They were just missing. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-1/lecture/WwsLz/1933-gleichschaltung","1933: Gleichschaltung","[MUSIC] Hello again. On January 30th, 1933 Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany. The National Socialist German Workers Party, better known as the Nazi Party, was a minor party within the German politics until 1930. In the May 1924 elections, it won 6.6% of the votes, and in those of May 1928, only 2.6% of the Germans supported it. Yet, in the next elections, those of September 1930, it got 18.3% of the votes. In July 1932 37.3% and on the deciding elections of November 1932 33.1% of the German's supported it. What can we learn from this data? A few things. First, the German political instability on the eve of Hitler rise to power. Second, the disturbing effect the world economic crisis, of 1929, had on German society. In October 1929, the Wall Street stock market crashed in what signaled the beginning of the Great Depression. All throughout the globe economies collapsed and millions lost their job. Yet, this worldwide crisis had a special effect on Germany, where people still remembered the depression and inflation of the end of World War I. Thus in Germany, this crisis was not only an economic one, but also a psychological one. It is no surprise that it resulted in political extremism in which naturalists on one hand and German economists on the other gained power. Third thing, we should point out regarding those figures is that unlike what many people believed, Hitler never won a majority vote in democratic elections. His appointment to councilor was within the democratic system and a result of political agreements not of a general support. The central parties could not create a stable coalition without one of the extremism parties. They had to choose between the Nazis and the Communist. Two parties which openly advocated dismantling democracy. German moderate leaders preferred Hitler, not only because of their fear of the communism, but also because they thought they would be able to control Hitler. They couldnt have been more wrong. Within weeks from the siege of power Hitler used the advanced democratic constitution of the Weimar Republic in order to destroy it. In less than a year Germany became Nazi Germany, as a first step Hitler manipulated the new scene and called for new elections on March the 5th. The second step, of after appointment of Hitler. In the late hours of February 27th, 1933, the Reichstag, the German parliament was set on fire. Though it seems as if Herman Goering, one of the leading figures in the Nazi party and the Minister of Interior was involved, that blame was imposed on the communists and the anarchists. More important, this event enabled Hitler to promote the Reichstag Fire Decree which reduced considerably many of the civil liberties of the German citizens and enabled Nazi authorities to imprison anyone who was grasped by them as an enemy. Communist and other German citizens were taken into protective custody, Schutzhaft, for an unknown and unset period of time. Where could the rest of the opponents have been held? They could have been put in jails like in any other modern country, but Hitler and the Nazi Party had a problem. Unlike other dramatic changes in forms of government, Hitler did not want to provoke a revolution and simply replace the existing civil apparatus with his people. Hitler wanted to enlist the German people and his bureaucratic system to his veld on showing, his wild view, but this would have taken too much time. Thus, he had to find a way to justify removal of people whom he deemed as dangerous elements without going through the legal system. So, what did the Nazi party do? They implemented a new form of detention facility for political enemies. Concentration camps. Less than two months after Hitler became Chancellor and three weeks after the Reichstag fire, Dachau the first of many concentration camps was established. The changing character of Nazi camps and the different aspects of life and death within them demand a full stand alone course. But in this framework we must limit ourself to a basic understanding of this system and its impact on the German society. Generally speaking, in the first years, inmates were supposedly imprisoned in the camp for their re-education, meaning they could be released, and some were released, only if they recognized, or if they pretended to recognize, the correctness of the Nazi path. Later on, and especially after 1936, to which we will refer later, releases became increasingly less common. More and more inmates were used for forced labor in the German industry, especially the military German industry. Thus, the regime used its enemies in order to promote its own interests. As soon as Nazi Germany occupied other countries, it understood it could kill two birds with one stone. Not only remove dangerous elements in the occupied countries, local political leaders, underground activists, and freedom fighters, but also use them for gentler needs benefits. What started in Dachau in 1933 tended in tens of thousands of camps which were erected during the war throughout Europe in order to enslave millions of European citizens. For those of you who want to know more, please see further readings suggested below. But returning to Hitler's first month in power and the establishment of Dachau, we should notice two more important things. First, in this stage, the inmates of the concentration camps were not Jewish but politician enemies. True, as you can see on the following table, if you were a Jewish communist or Jewish criminal, your chances to die in the camp were considerably high. Yet Jews were imprisoned in camps for their Jewishness only in 1938 as we will see later. Second, the Nazi concentration camps had a decisive role not only in reeducating prisoners and guards about their superiority but also in reeducating the entire German population. Unlike the familiar punishment system of a felony, a police interrogation, a trial, a verdict, and implementation of the punishment, the Nazi Schutzhaft protective custody worked completely differently. People, and those surrounding them, did not always know why they were arrested or where they were taken, as well when and if they will ever be released. Not many really knew what was going on in the camps, but all heard enough to understand it was too dangerous to ask more about it. Rumors and whispers about people who were dragged through their beds intensified the terror no less than the SA thugs who filled the streets. In March 1933, Nazi terrorism swept Germany. While disseminating fear within the German society, creating a reality that helped him win more than 43% of the vote in March 5th elections, Hitler continued to work on gaining endless political power. On the 23 of March, 1933, the German Reichstag approved the Enabling Act. In which the Parliament gave away its power and function, for a strict period which never ended in Nazi Germany. The full legislative power was handed to the Reich Chancellor, Hitler, and the government. Now, the road was paved to the true implementation of the Gleichschaltung, forcible coordination of the Nazi Party and the German state. Starting in March 1933, The Nazi Party took over the German States. Local elections were dissolved and other results were forced on them. In April [FOREIGN], leaders were appointed in order to create a Nazi mechanism parallel to that of the state. Under this mechanism, [FOREIGN], original leaders of the party, Leader of districts, Nazi head of cities and villages, and so on were appointed. The Nazi Party gained geographical control of Germany. Public and political life in Germany was the next target. In May 1933 all trade unions were abolished. And instead the German Labor Front, the Nazi organization was established. In July 14th, all parties were dismantled, leaving the Nazi party as the only legal one. Leftist youth movements were outlawed and all the others were incorporated into the Nazi Hitler Jugand. Student's organizations ceased to exist, leaving only the National Socialist German Students League. The same happened in the realm of welfare, where only the National Socialist People's Welfare remained legal, or the new National Socialist Teacher's League, which replaced all former teacher's unions. In the field of culture, a life cultural organization was established and all cultural activities throughout Germany had to get the approval of its heads and so on. The first of May became the Day of National Work. And the day Hitler gained power, the 30th of January was declared a new national holiday. At this stage, one could not be a part of any social or professional organization, teachers, lawyers, or mechanics, and avoid that season. The party was the state. The Nazi party took over the state infrastructure by blurring the dividing lines between party and state institutions And thus creating Nazi Germany or The Third Reich. Nazi Germany was much more than a dictatorship. It was a totalitarian regime which controlled and ruled all aspects of the life of its citizens, who they will marry, how many kids they will have, what will be their profession or where will they work. All were the interest of the Nazi German state. The last elections ever to be held in Nazi Germany took place on November 12, 1933. Hitler won more than 92% of the votes of the German people. At the end of 1933, Hitler could look at this transformation with satisfaction. The republic of Vimer was gone to a larger stand, although the overall process of would last until 1937. How did people, German European citizens, react to this new reality. And what else changed in the later years of Nazi Germany. Those are some of the questions we will answer in our next units.

After better understanding the development from ancient hatred of the Jews to modern antisemitism and the manner in which it was so well rooted in European countries and societies. I want us to move on to Nazi ideology. Here we must ask, what was new about that antisemitism? Was there anything special about it? I mean was it more of the same, the same well known antisemitism only intensified? Or did this ideology pose a completely new stage in hatred towards the Jews? One of the scholars who contributed considerably to this discussion is Professor Saul Friedlander. A chapter of his book is the recommended reading for this lesson. In the first volume of his book, Nazi Germany and the Jews, Friedlander coined a new term to characterize Nazi hatred of the Jews. Redemptive Antisemitism. Redemptive Antisemitism sees the Jews as a fundamental threat to the world. The Jews by their mere existence are a destructive element which poison humanity and is a hazard to the existence of the natural order, which is of course a racial one. This unique redemptive antisemitism and its implications can be illustrated by Adolf Hitler's well-known book, Mein Kampf. That was written while he was serving time in prison for his Putsch attempt in November 1923. In The Beer Hall Putsch, he turned his nationalist comrades tried to resist control of Germany in a failed arm action. Caught and tried for intrusion, Himmler was sentenced to 5 years in jail though he served only 9 months. During this time, he was imprisoned in very comfortable conditions. He had a private room, in which he received his many guests. He got regular deliveries of newspapers and books and was surrounded by his personal assistants and friends. All this enabled him to continue to see himself as victorious. Look at the Roman oak wreath behind him if not now, in the near future. Yet most of his time in prison was dedicated to composing Mein Kampf. >> More than ten million copies of Mein Kampf were printed in Nazi Germany. And there was hardly a German home without a copy of it, or even more than one. We have here some early copies of this book. Yet most people didn't really read it. Consisting mainly of babble about personal memories and Hitlers understanding regarding the natural socialist party, it was really incoherent and mainly very boring. True, it exposed how Hitler viewed Germany future domestic and foreign affairs as well as what he thought about Jews. But somehow this important book was put aside by scholars at the time. It was only in the late 1960's when German historian, delved into the book and exposed how much of Hitler's future actions were engraved in it. You are more than welcome to read more in Jackel's book, Hitler's World View, a Blueprint for Power. A careful reading of Mein Kampf clearly reveals Hitler redemptive antisemitism. Let's read it together. If with the help of his Marxist creed, the Jews is victorious over the other peoples of the world, his crown will be the funeral wreath of humanity and this planet will as it did thousands of years ago, move through the authority void of men. And it continues, eternal nature inexorably avenges the infringement of her command. Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator. By defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord. Hitler saw himself, as the one, who will save the world from its destruction by the Jews. The fuhrer, the leader, but also the redeemer. Let's watch for a moment the Nazi film, Triumph des Willens, Triumph of the Will. Edited and co-written by the German if not Nazi film director Leni Riefenstahl. This was filmed during the 1934 conference of the Nazi party in Nuremberg. It starts with the following caption, and please notice the change of music. [SOUND] On September the 5th 1934 20 years after the outbreak of the First World War. 16 years after the beginning of the German's suffering. [MUSIC] 19 months after the beginning of the German rebirth. [MUSIC] Adolf Hitler flew once again to Nuremberg to hold a military display. [MUSIC] Then we see a plane making its way in heavy clouds. As the plane comes closer to the beautiful German city decorated with flags and swastikas, the clouds are scattered, the sun is shining, and Hitlers lands to the cheers and delighted saluted of all of the German people waiting only for him. [MUSIC] >> [APPLAUSE] What we can actually see here has been called political theology. Hitler sanctified the political sphere presenting himself as a savior. He used religious notions when referring to himself, the party or the German people. And at the same time he actually secularized Christianity by diminishing its authority, legitimacy and values. And Hitler and the core Nazis had a true problem with Christianity. It was not only the Jewishness of Jesus Christ or Mary, but the many values which Christianity promoted and honored were unacceptable from the Nazi point of view. I'm not talking here only about whether the conversion of the Jews is possible or not. The very basic notions of the Christian religion posed a true threat to Hitler racist world. Love your enemy. Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also. Those were unbearable tenets according to Hitler and Nazism which nurtured the colossal world of weak versus strong, inferior versus superior. Hitler claimed that those dangerous notions penetrated the world by Judaism in order to run it. This is what Hitler said of the 17th of February 1942 in one of his table talks. The sensational event of the ancient world was the mobilization of the underworld against the established order. This enterprise of Christianity had no more to do with religion than Marxist socialism had to do with the solution of the social problem. The Jew who fraudulently introduced Christianity into the ancient world, in order to ruin it, reopened the same breach in modern times. This time taking as his pretext the social question. Just as Saul was changed into St. Paul, Mardochai became Karl Marx. Peace can result only from a natural order. The condition of this order is that there is a hierarchy among the nations. The most capable nations must necessarily take the lead. In this order, the subordinate nations get the greater profit, being protected by the more capable nations. It is the jury that always destroys this order. It constantly provokes the revolt of the weak against the strong. Of bestiality against intelligence, of quantity against quality. The more we render the Jew incapable of harming us, the more we shall protect ourselves from this danger. The Jews play in nature the role of a catalyzing element. A people that is rid of its Jews returns spontaneously to the natural order. >> In the irrational Nazi analysis of history, major processes of Western civilization were attributed to the Jews. Moses in sighting the slaves, disrupted Egyptian society and St. Paul propagated Christianity to undermined the Roman Empire. From this perspective, the Nazi's also viewed botulism, not as a phenomenon, rooted in the developments of modern European history, but rather as the most radical recent form of the ancient Jewish conspiracy. Which causes national dissolution and disintegration. For Hitler, Nazism was thus a doctrine of world salvation to redeem humanity from the Jewish Christian Marx's doctrine. The acquisition and maintenance of total supremacy of the German race, Hitler believed must be through total war of Germans against the Jews in a fight of which the only alternatives are victory or extinction for either side. >> Thus Hitler and Nazism had a weltanschauung, a world view, which wished to create a new order of the world based on races. The [INAUDIBLE] is what polluted the world, with a basic principle of human equality. A principle which runs contrary to the principle of nature, which is hierarchy. Therefore, Christianity, Universalism, Liberalism, Communism, Socialism, Capitalism, Bolshevism and more were all dangerous Jewish ideas. The redemption of the world and the establishment of a much needed racial new order, demanded a war against the Jews and their ultimate removal. Yet how could this be done? How could Hitler and his party apparatus shape a state and a society which are based on those ideas? How can they change the Weimar Democratic Republic into Nazi Germany? Which promoted those anti semitic and racist ideas. [MUSIC]",""

Traditional anti-Semitism as a central background","[MUSIC] Hello, as mentioned, the Holocaust stemmed from the Nazi anti-Semitic ideology, yet anti-Semitism, hatred and discrimination of the Jews preceded Nazi Germany by more than 2,000 years. In fact in the European culture which stems from Christianity and its Hellenistic ancestor, Jews had a special place for centuries. Why the Jews? Why are persons who preserve the Jewish religion or belong to the Jewish people so deeply hated for centuries by so many? What were the motives for this hatred, and did it change or develop throughout history? And above all, was there anything special about Nazi anti-Semitism which contributed to its genocidal character. In the next units we'll talk about traditional hatred of the Jews, as well as modern anti-Semitism and its part in Nazi ideology. First we'll describe the way this troubling phenomena appeared throughout the ages and expose its different facades. We'll assert that the widespread existence of well-rooted anti-Jewish traditions in modern Europe served as a necessary yet insufficient condition for the Holocaust. Only next we'll turn to Nazi anti-Semitism and try to better understand its essence. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion carrying unique traditions and customs which inspired other religions, mainly Christianity and Islam. Today it includes many different notions, cultural, philosophical and national, which are not of our interest in this course. But in its origin, stands obligation to God and His commandments. In Judaism, the followers, the Jews, are demanded to obey detailed set of practical commandments which set the private and public life of the Jewish people, and define society's ethical norms. In ancient times, in the Pagan world, such conduct was grasped as very strange. Tacitus, the famous Roman historian, wrote in the beginning of the 2nd century about the Jews, and I quote Moses, the nation's biblical leader, wishing to secure for the future his authority over the nation, gave them a novel form of worship, opposed to all that is practiced by other men. Things sacred with us, with them have no sanctity, while they allow what with us is forbidden. Tacitus went on and described Jews as he grasped them, and the way that in his understanding Jewish customs shaped them as strangers and even evil strangers. Among themselves they are inflexibly honest and ever ready to show compassion, though they regard the rest of mankind with all hatred of enemies. They sit apart at meals, they sleep apart. You can retest it to a full interpretation of the Jewish customs below. But what is important for our discussion is that even in the Hellenistic and Roman world, Jews were grasped as the others and hatred and feared as such. They were non-Pagans in a world in which Paganism ruled. And their monotheistic beliefs and practical customs were comprehended as suspicious, if not dangerous. With the rise of Christianities, whose origin are Jewish, and its expansion throughout Europe in the 4th century, this hatred was magnified, and even more integrated as an important part into the theological worldview of Christianity. >> Along the middle ages, a negative image of Jews, as individuals and as a collective, has been built. It's started in antiquity. It continued during the scriptures of the fathers of the church. And it was made of a number of expects. The first one was the religious one, because still Jews were considered and accused of having crucified Jesus Christ, of not accepting Him, of not understanding that He and Christianity are the source of light, of the right side, of being the good ones, and they served as an antithesis to this. They were the evil ones, the dark ones, both physically and mentally. Not only that, the figure of Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed, the pupil who betrayed, Jesus Christ for the sake of money, this figure has become the symbol and the inclination of betrayal for money. And then more negative characteristics were added. Second aspect was the economic one. Jews served as the middle class, between the lower ones and the upper ones. And the lower ones considered them as exploiters, who exploit them in favor and for the interest of the upper ones. And so, more negative characteristics were added. The capacity of Jews to handle money cleverly and exploit others, and to have mental capacities that others didn't have, such as the ability of Jewish children from an early age to read and write which was unknown so far in Europe. Now, where all this was leading? It was leading to a notion that taking all these characteristics together, the Jews dispersed among the nations must have some goal, something in common leading them. And this is hurting the Christian body, the Christian mind in a multitude of ways, such as the famous blood Libel, such as the collecting of blood for passover, and poisoning the ways, etc., etc. Now, this figure serves until today as a possible explanation for revolutions, wars, and other calamities including financial crisis, because the Jew could be held responsible for events that no one took responsibility for. >> As one can see, Jews and Judaism, per se, became a symbol of something vile. And were identified was a mysterious and mystical satanic power operating throughout history. The Christians blamed the Jews for killing Christ. Therefore in Christian's thought Jews were sentenced as an eternal degraded existence. Moreover anti-Jews' stereotypes became part of the Christian world and penetrated its folklore, culture and literature, thus, becoming part of the general culture of western society. What is not less interesting about these traditional hatred of Jews is that although it was shaped and crystallized in a medieval Europe as a religious hatred, it continued to exist and even intensified in modern times, times of secularity and enlightenment. The anti-Jewish stereotype and notions were so deeply entrenched in the culture of Christian Europe, that with the secularization and enlightenment they did not disappear, but underwent a metamorphosis. Modernity provided old notions and anti-Jewish stereotypes new forms. And secularity converted their religious hatred into a secular one, whether national, social, or other. Actually, the basic quest for wisdom even gave this traditional hatred a new framework, which had a far reaching implication, scientific and racial anti-Semitism. >> Starting at the end of the 19th century, towards the beginning of the 20th century, we see across the European continent, from Paris to Berlin, to Warsaw, to St. Petersburg, the wider, general collapse of the liberal democratic dream of Jews entering European society as equal participants and full citizens. And the rise of social intolerance, political hatreds, tensions and anti-Semitic movements. In Paris in 1894 with the Dreyfus affair, in Vienna in 1895 and 1897 with the election of Karl Lueger to the position of Head of the City, Mayor of the City, in Warsaw, with the National Democratic Movement lead by Roman Dmowski in 1906, 1912, we see time and again that mass politics or modern politics, across the European continent embrace, propagate, and manipulate anti-Jewish prejudices and attitudes. And turn into anti-Semitic movements. Indeed across the continent tens of thousands, and then hundreds of thousands, and then millions of Europeans knowingly or willfully embraced anti-Semitic ideologies and politics towards the end of the 19th and the early 20th century. Another aspect of modern anti-Semitism that differentiates it from traditional religious-based anti-Semitism is the influence of racial theories and race science. Starting with Darwin and other thinkers it was end of the 19th and early 20th century. Anthropologists, biologists, social scientists begin looking at society and humanity as distinct groups of peoples and races, groups that were clearly different from one another and, which at times, could not be intermixed or could not really be assimilated. In many cases these racial scientists focused their lens on Jews in Germany across the continent, and began to produce a series of studies claiming and stating that Jews were not only different from other Europeans but were ultimately indelible or unassimilable. From this conclusion, many didn't realize the position that Jews were not simply different or other than their neighbors or other Europeans in Paris and Vienna and Berlin or Warsaw, but that they were in fact a completely different type of society one that cannot be assimilated into the European body of nations. >> Alongside traditional hatred of the Jews, emerges more than anti-Semitism, with its national, political, and racial components. This racial anti-Semitism did not refer to Judaism as a religion, nor as a nation, and did not stem from practical relations between Jews and non-Jews. It was an ideology of prejudice, which combined secularized religious myth with pseudo-scientific theories and racism. It reinterpreted the traditional anti-Jewish view through the angle of new racial concepts. Thus, treating Jews as a race, which determined according to their understanding, the personal character of each and every Jewish individual regardless of his or her acts, conversion, the all-Christian recipe for solving the Jewish problem was therefore worthless. And nothing a Jew would have done could have changed his racial, immutable character in the eyes of those new anti-Semites. More troubling was that this new ideology carried a promising message. It claimed that the misfortune of so many different social strata in modern Europe was a result of Jewish actions and could be solved accordingly. Economic problems which were created by industrializations and urbanization, communism or capitalism, all evil of the modern society stemmed from the Jews. That is in the turmoil of economic and social modernization, which radically changed European society in the 19th century, anti-Semitism became a political tool. So what, if anything, was so unique or new about Nazi anti-Semitism? [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-1/lecture/kUoVC/introduction-why-the-holocaust-why-history-why-this-course","Introduction: why the Holocaust, why history, why this course?","[MUSIC] The Holocaust was an unprecedented attempt made by Nazi Germany and its collaborators to annihilate the Jewish people, men and women, old people and young, and to destroy what the Nazis defined as Judaism or the Jewish spirit. Between 1933 and 1945, six million Jews were murdered, and with them, some noble ideals of modernity and other moral values collapsed. And basic notions of humanity were shaken to the core. The Holocaust revealed In a clear and painful manner the deep abuse of human cruelty. The dark places, individuals and societies can reach and the destructiveness of murderous ideologies. The few, but major in any moral sense act of compassion could not light the dark and bitter days that covered Europe. It is no surprise that this traumatic event challenged some fundamental notions of the world as we know it today and has had a far reaching impact on a variety of aspects of our lives as it were shaped since 1945. The developement of international law, the rise of philosophical and literary doctrines, art, cinema and architecture. As well as the culture of memory were all influenced by this seminal event. It even questioned humanities obligation to the ultimate commandment, thou shalt not kill. This is exactly why learning about the Holocaust is valuable not only to those who have a direct and personal connection to the events or to those who live in places it once occurred. The Western civilized world as we know it was so profoundly influenced by the Holocaust that whoever seeks to understand our current surrounding must look carefully at this horrific past. Yet those murderous act did not appear out of the blue and they were well rooted in the history of Europe. The Holocaust stemmed from Nazi anti-Semitic ideology which perceived the Jews as a fundamental danger to Germany. And as an ultimate threat to Europe and all of humanity. Nevertheless, the destruction of Jewish life in Germany began only as Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933 when the aforementioned ideology became the official policy of the German state. As the influence of Nazi Germany expanded due to treaties in and occupation, the persecution of the Jews expanded too. Throughout Europe and it's fears of influence. Jews were stripped of their property and dignity, marked with a badge of shame, concentrated and segregated in ghettos or by other means. Although misery, hunger and death prevailed the systematic and total mass murder of the Jews began only in the mid 1941. On the 22nd of June 1941, Nazi Germany launched Operation Barbarossa and invaded the Polish territories that Soviet Russia occupied at the beginning of the second world war. From this point on, millions of Jews were murdered. First in shooting pits and killing sites, later on by gas or by other means. Some camps and facilities were planned and built for this purpose only, mass murder of the Jews. In this manner, ancient Jewish communities that lived and flourished in Europe for almost 2,000 years vanished in what was termed by the Nazis the final solution to the Jewish question. Along side those horrendous acts, Nazi Germany committed many other crimes against humanity. Including the murder of millions of various other European citizens. For racial, political, and ideological purposes. Among the groups targeted for murder were people with disabilities, Sinty and Roma. Polish civilians and Russian prisoners of war. The Holocaust was a most radical and exceptional genocide. It exposed the abuse of human behavior, as well as the types of elevation, and it influenced the course of European and World History. How was it humanly possible? How did citizens of a cultural, civilized nation such as Germany, and many other individuals all over Europe, how did they become mass murderers? Active participants in a state-organized genocide. How did billions of European Jews live and die in those horrible days, what were their fears and hopes? What were these choices and did they really have any? What did they know, for example, about the mass murders? And what, if anything, could they have done as fathers, mothers, children, as human beings in order to survive? And what about the millions and millions who witnesses those atrocities? What about the civilians, and governments of numerous European countries, and of the free world? Did they know what was going on? Did they care? Could they have done more? Should they have done more? How did they cope with the burden of witnessing, and the weight of remembrance? These are some the questions we will address in this course. Not all of them have definitive answers. Not everything is or can be known or understood, but if you want to learn more about this seminal and Earth event in World, European, and Jewish history, come and join us in this course. This course has two parts, each consisting of three lessons. In each lesson we'll concentrate a different aspect of the Holocaust. Some of the chapters will refer to the chronological development of historical events. Others will concentrate on a Semitic subject. Such as the Nazi ideology or Jewish life in the shadow of death. Each topic will be described and analyzed by leading researchers in the field. Thus exposing you to various scholarly and historical points of view. By this, we wish to provide you the wide general and complex picture of the Holocaust. Yet, each and every subject we mention could be, and actually is a topic for many different courses, antisemitism, Germany in the 1930s, the Ghettoization process, or the final solution all are presented to you here in a nutshell. Therefore, during our lessons, we will try to draw your attention to major publications in the field, as well as to its main researchers. If you want to learn more, if you wish to deepen and broaden your knowledge about this subject, or another, you are more than welcome to read more in a recommended reading list, or in the many other publications, which are probably available in your nearest library. But in this course we're not only strive to better our understanding about the Holocaust but also to show you how history is made and what it is made of. What are the sources the building blocks that historians use in order to improve their understanding of our common past? How do they use them? We live in an age of information. We are literally bombarded daily with endless information. Newspaper, TV, the Internet. And this constant flow will only grow with time. Much of the information we obtain is well processed for us. Collected, valued, verified, and confronted, in order to give us the bottom line. In this course we wish to give you an opportunity to learn how it is done or how should it be done. How historical evidence is collected and formed into a meaningful story. In our lessons we will be using different historical sources such as official documents, personal diaries, visual sources, works of art and more. Yet in each lesson we have chosen one document to zoom in on. We want you to experience the fascinating and challenging process of arriving at established historical conclusion from basic historical sources. In what we termed from the historian's desk we will ask you what could and should be understood from a specific document? You will literally see the necessity of placing a source in a broad and accurate historical context, the significance of a careful and critical reading, and the value of analyzing skills. Thus, beyond the broadest knowledge, which will be made available to you, we offer you a peak into the historians laboratory. Which will expose you to both the possibilities and limitations of scholarly research into the humanities. Nevertheless, in this course we wish to do more than study the Holocaust, or show you how history is being made. We want you to help us process, create and share additional historical knowledge of this significant era. One future over time and of this MOOC platform Is the ability to use crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing can enable us to obtain and process large amount of historical data. Since so many of you have chosen to take this course, we can examine together a specific aspect of the Holocaust from multiple points of view. In some of our lessons you will be guided to locate relevant historical data and to upload it in the forms. Your answers will help us and all of your fellow classmates better understand some aspects of the Holocaust. Thus, as you can see, we considered you to be not only those who should sharpen there understanding about the Holocaust, but also partners in this unique learning process.

Tracy, what are some of the key features of PR in the world today? >> Now, a lot of the ways in which we communicate today are shaped by the digital technologies we are immersed in. Facebook, YouTube. These are the new platforms of communication. These technologies are also bringing the world closer together. Mohan, you work a great deal on communication and culture. Do you want to talk a little bit about how public relation affects contacts across the globe? >> Yes, you're absolutely right, Tracy. With new communication technologies, we have increasingly become aware of different cultures, different customs, and traditions and different values that people hold so dearly. What this means is as communicators we have to learn to be open to difference. We also have to learn how cultures of such rich variety thus adapting the way we communicate to the different cultural context we are in. At the same time, that we are in the midst of so much change and adaptation all over the world there are some key threads that are consistent across cultures. Iccha, what are some of the key threads that are consistent across cultures? >> Well some of the things that in public relations is to understand the process of PR is very important, as this process works quite similarly across cultures and contexts. We also know that some important theories of PR, and media holds across cultural contexts. We know the value of public relations strategy, research and tactics as the anchors for learning about PR. In this course, in fact, we will talk about these key elements of PR practice and explore how we can apply them to solving problems. So, we will do this in specialization is to take you through a journey of public relations in a digital world. >> I will begin by introducing you to the practice of public relations. We will look at PR jobs and trends. We will look at how employment looks like. We will then learn about the PR process. PR theories will help us understand better this overall process. Finally in this first course we will wrap up with a basic introduction to strategy and tactics so you will learn how to create and implement a PR plan. >> And I will follow that course up with important elements of research, the process of research in PR. I will be teaching the second course Public Relation Research. In this course, we will learn about the role of research in PR, the steps of research and how to carry out research. >> I will be back in the third course now to share with you about a key element of PR, campaigns. Over the last two decades I have worked as a strategist, planner and evaluator for multiple successful campaign all over the globe. I will share with you the nuts and bolts of campaigns and how to put them together theories of campaigns and steps for implementing and evaluating them. >> I love new communication technologies, we are surrounded by digital media. Social media have transformed how we communicate with each other, as well as our expectations of communication. I will cover these aspects. I will also talk about the concept of engagement, managing strategic interactions through digital technologies. >> And then we will wrap up this with a capstone course. The capstone experience will sum up all the key elements of public relations you have learned through the previous four courses.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/lesson-design/lecture/yk6VW/video-5-summary","Video 5: Summary","Welcome back to Teach English Now. Lesson design and assessment. We hope you've enjoyed the first module on Basic Design Principles. You'll probably notice we didn't discuss Gagne's last three stages of development. Don't worry we'll get there. But since his last three events are closely related to assessment and evaluation, we're going to speak more about them in an upcoming module. >> For now, let's review what we have learned so far by discussing some of the information we have shared with you in this module. First, we presented Dr. Robert Gagne's Instructional Design Principles, which came from both behaviorists and information processing theory. In general, his theory assumes that in order for instruction to be received well that there is more to it than simply pouring information directly into the brain, an assumption that we strongly agree with. While not all of his instructional events may be necessary for every lesson we find them useful to discuss as a sort of ideal lesson plan. >> Gagne's first three events of instruction are gaining attention, informing students of objectives and stimulating prior recall of instruction. Remember that gaining the attention refers to more than just telling students, hey let's go, it's time to start class. Rather, gaining attention refers to helping shine a spotlight on a theme or information you wish to share as you begin a lesson. Second, informing students of objectives allows students to understand your goals and the goals of the class in general. And can give students an important insight into not only what you're teaching but why you're teaching it. And finally, stimulating prior recall of instruction is a tool for both student and teacher. For a student, it allows them to strengthen neural pathways and become more ready to connect new information with information you've previously shared. As a teacher it allows you to know what students know, what students remember, and perhaps what needs to be reviewed again. >> In Gagne's next three events of instruction, we learn about events that are related to both instruction and practice. The events are presenting the content, providing learner guidance, and eliciting performance. When presenting content, your job will be to find ways to present information clearly. Helping break down concepts so that students can acquire language. No doubt you will use teacher talk, stories, diagrams, visual aids, and all of those things you have seen from dynamic, engaging instructors. Remember the tip, to present in the present, meaning you shouldn't just talk about language whether you should talk to students in way that draws them into the instruction. I highly recommend the bonus reading, what is warm language? To help you understand a little bit more about the concept of presenting in the present. After you present the content, the next event is to give guidance to students. This is often done by creating activities that can be done in pairs, groups or as an entire class. The point of providing guidance is to help students practice with the new information, struggle with it, and receive help as they get things wrong and attempt to get it right. Mistakes at this stage of the game are highly encouraged. Finally, teachers must elicit performance, meaning that sooner or later, the time will come for students to show what they've got. A performance could mean a writing assignment, a quiz, a test, a speech, you name it. But it always involves an opportunity to allow students to shine. To share their knowledge and demonstrate their ability to do what they have been taught. >> In the next modules, we will go into even more depth about lesson planning and ask you to create a lesson plan yourself. To help you with this long term assignment, we are asking you to download a lesson plan template, that will help give you the big picture of what you will eventually be asked to do. >> We will also be asking you to respond to a writing prompt at the end of each module, and this writing prompt will guide you to create a certain portion of the lesson plan. For this module however our writing prompt will be a bit different. We simply want you to respond to what you have learned so far by answering the question, which of the six events in Robert Gagne's instructional design theory resonate the most with you and why? >> Do I have to choose just one? I think all of these are essential elements to lesson design. It's a tough question. Good luck everyone. >> And see you next time on Teach English Now. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-1/lecture/tAtNF/europe-and-its-jews-between-the-two-world-wars","Europe and its Jews between the two world wars","[MUSIC] Note the name for final chapter for today. Natural European Jewry is used even by us, by Europe and the Jews. The reason for that is simple but important. Studying Jewish life as it emerged in Europe between the two world wars reveals that there was no European Jewry. Perhaps, we can speak of European jeweries, many different individuals and groups connected and conflicted by numerous ties and ideas. Those dynamic and vital communities did not and actually could not have one way of life or one united leadership. And were in a constant dialog driven by endless tensions which created and shaped a diverse Jewish society. Most European Jews lived in cities, yet especially in the east, millions still lived in small location, small towns, shtetls, and villages. Some Jews still lived in a complete Jewish environment. Others had mainly had non-Jewish neighbors and friends. Jews were part of the modern economy in every sense, and thus could be found in any occupation. There were not only Jewish doctors, lawyers, bankers, and rabbis, but also porters, farmers, transportation workers, as well as scientists, teachers, architects, musicians, composers, athletes, fashion models, journalists, and editors. True, not many Jews were accepted to Public Service. And especially in Eastern Europe, with Russia as an exception, many municipalities avoided employing Jews. But even there, and of course in Western European countries, one could find Jewish clerks, social workers, and Jewish judges. Thinking of it, there wasn't the discipline of science, or a field of culture in which Jews were not apparent. Yet, most Jews, like most other people, were not Nobel Prize winners, and not well known stars. The vast majority of Jews throughout the continent were occupied in the trade business, and industry. There were white collar Jewish workers, more in the West than in the East, but there were much more blue collar Jews. Earning a satisfying income was quite a challenge for many, even in the 20s, but became almost impossible in the 30s. The Great Depression did not Jews, and especially after 1929 Jewish life did not consist only of prosperity, but also of great poverty and decline. In each and every country, Jewish life before the war had its own features. Some influenced by its surroundings, so emerging from internal forces. And each group within the Jewish society develop it's own mechanism to cope with the changing world. Despite internal differences which exceed the framework of this session one can try and describe the different patterns which developed throughout the continents and we'll start with it's western parts. >> The question is what is Western Europe? Is Germany part of Western Europe? I think that in this period that we're talking about, Germany should be seen as central Europe. So, when you speak about western Europe, we speak about France Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the Scandinavian countries, Italy. And the largest Jewish communities in those countries were in France where there were a little bit more than 300,000 Jews and how long 140,000 Jews. And what was they're situation, what were these conditions? Now, Jews were living in these countries for centuries. From the 17th century or even earlier but these communities grew also, and a lot of immigrants came from Eastern New York during the period of the end of the 19th century. And at the beginning of the 20th century many of them settled down in France, Belgium, and Holland. Now France, Belgium and Holland were, as you say, Western European Countries, but they were very, very different in the composition of the Jewish communities. They had different organizations, but what is important is that these countries were countries of long standing emancipation, that started at the end of century and therefore also the Jews had integrated and had changed their languages from the Jewish language Yiddish, or Yiddish Deutsch as it was in the 17th Century, to the local languages they had adapted. Also in politics Jews integrated since the Mid-19th Century and they can be found in the Central and left wing parties. Now, it is very important to see that the Jews who were living there for many centuries, the native Jews, were very loyal to the countries. There was expressions regarding of France that the Jews were [FOREIGN] Jews of the state, and much more than any other French person, because they owed their emancipation to the state. Also, in Holland the Jews were very loyal to the House of Orange, which represented the state as such. Economically, they could be found in the middle class, and which is not so much now in the proletariat. So, there were many Jews especially in Amsterdam for instance, that belonged to the proletariat, and that counters the very common image of the ritual which existed at that time and is still very well and known up till today. So, Jews therefore could be found in those left wing organizations and the bourgeoisie layer of society. >> This complicated picture raises many questions regarding the way Jews saw themselves, the general public, and their place within it. A Jewish life in the east was shaped in somehow different manners, not to mention Jews who lived in Soviet Russia who had their own unique reality. >> With the end of World War I and the signing of the Paris Peace Treaty, >> We see across East-Central Europe the rise of a new political institution, the nation state. Based on one dominant ethnic group, the nation state was to be the ruling model for East-Central Europe for the entire interwar period. From the Baltic States, down to Poland, into Hungary and Romania and Czechoslovakia. The nation state rose, and with it, a new political order. As part of this new hopeful political order, the nation state not only gained independence but agreed to give full democratic political and civil rights to the minorities that remained in its midst, including the Jews. As a result of these agreements which were embraced and signed in international treaties. Jew received equal rights for political, cultural, educational, and religious activity from the Baltic States down into Romania. As a result of these changes, Jewish politics. Educational institutions, cultural institutions like theater and newspapers flourished like they never before flourished in the interwar era. ,Jewish life, politics, education, cultural institutions flourished in interwar Lithuania, Poland, Hungary. In the Soviet Union, the story was slightly different. In the Soviet Union, Jews were accepted as full citizens, as members of the Soviet state. But Jewish cultural, political, and religious institutions slowly became illegal activity and Jews had to face a difficult decision. They could as individuals become full members of Soviet society, but they had to leave behind the cultural, religious, and political institutions that they had long embraced, and enjoyed for hundreds of years in Eastern Europe. >> It was not only the many different nationalities Jews belonged or the various way in which they defined their Judaism. Jews as individuals and as communities seized an activity. Those people left their mark not only within the Jewish world but also in many public of European society. Alongside the Jewish part in general undertakings, Jews throughout the continent Establish Jewish institutions and Jewish organizations of various types, schools, hospitals, political parties, worker's union, used movements and more. Quiet impressive on the one hand but on the other, one of the outcomes of the constant activity was the emergence of the complicated and the diversed Jewish world. As implied before and as shown lately in the important book by Bernard Wasserstein On the Eve: The Jews of Europe Before the Second World War. Things were not that simple or pleasant. Between the two world wars Jews adopted many different ways of trying to improve their situation And promise our children a better life. Some entain the Jewish religion is Hasidic Jews or their opponents. Others moved away and acculturated or assimilated into their surroundings. Jewish socialism, as well as communism, played an important part for some Jewish people especially, but not only, in Eastern Countries. In the Soviet Union, the regime proposed true economic equality, yet the price was erasing all religious or national Jewish expressions. The Bund promised to shape a better world for Jews and non Jews. But the long forged Polish Jewish brotherhood of The Bund was challenged by widespread antisemitism. Jewish nationality Zionism was not less misleading at the time. Many jews hoping for a future Jewish homeland couldn't really reach the land of Israel. Palestine at the time. Whether because of economic or political obstacles or whether due to their inability to exchange their modern European homeland With a remote insecure and even primitive at the time image and reality of the promised land. Look at their faces. Their smiles as well as their seriousness influenced by many concerns. Try and find in those pictures and feelings evidence of their connection to Judaism, to Europe, to life. Most of those films were taken by Jewish immigrants who returned to a visit in the old home land capturing with their cameras their world that was about to sink. Many especially the old don't move in those films. They think it is a still photo. You see We're back to visual documentation and much can be learned from it. Yet, those photos and fill ins that are presented to you now, and you can find more fill ins down below, come to show the faces of European. Their smiles, their vocations, their normal lives. Photos like those, each and every one of us keep in his or her album or treasures in his or her memories. Actually maybe some of you even have pictures of Jews taken, between the two world wars, alone or with non-Jewish friends. If you wish you are more than welcome to upload them to a special form open for this purpose. We'll not use those photos for anything else, but your photos will join what was used here And will enable us to demonstrate the many different faces of Jews and their surroundings in those times. The Jewish population in Europe in those years was lively and involved in constant political, social and cultural activities. Living in a changing world, challenges, obstacles and opportunities were part of the daily kaleidoscope, which was threatening to some and exciting for others. But primarily, they were engaging all of those small, everyday human concerns. Will their soccer team win against its world rival? Are there any planned dismissals in the working place [INAUDIBLE] they are not aware of? And how could they, should they raise their children promising that their lives as Jews, as citizens of various European countries, as human beings, will be better than theirs. The answers given by European Jews to those questions were varied and often contradictory. But even in the worst dreams no one every imagined those questions and answers would be meaningless when Nazi Germany took over Europe. Meet us next week to learn together what those Jews could have done if anything during the Holocaust. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-1/lecture/1lEpJ/a-world-at-war-and-world-jewry","A World at War and world Jewry","[MUSIC] I would like us now to place a realities mentioned in previous units in a wider perspective. The Holocaust took place in the background of the Second World War with its multiple arenas. It was not only Europe which was torn between various forces. But the whole world was in turmoil. From November 1939 to March 1940, the Winter War between the USSR and Finland was raging in full force. And in summer and autumn of 1940, British pilots managed to block the German aerial attacks of the battle over Britain while the civil society lived through the blitz. And in the second half of 1941, Soviet soldiers stopped with their bodies the advancing German forces strengthen by Axis soldiers. The United States was dragged into the war in December 1941 with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and soon became one of the main forces, fighting not only Japanese, but also Nazi Germany and other Axis states. And in 1942, North African became a bitter battlefield with tanks roaming its deserts. During all those long years, endless atrocities were committed by Japanese forces on Chinese soil and in other parts of Far East. Tens of thousands of American soldiers were killed in the Pacific in the war with Japan included among others, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand. Canadian, Australian, and New Zealandian soldiers were buried in Europe, North Africa, and the Far East. And tens of thousands soldiers and civilians drowned during the war on the seas. All over the world, there were also resistant fighters who fought their occupiers. And many Poles, French, Yugoslavians, Greeks, Chinese, and others lost their lives in an endless fight for freedom. Not all parties were involved in each and every conflict. But dozens of countries were involved in military clashes in one manner or another during the decade of 1935 to 1945. This was a horrific world war which greatly exceeded even the dreadful first world war in its shocking cruelty and claimed the lives of tens of millions of soldiers and civilians. Among the murdered were about 6 million Jews. In some places more than 90% of the original Jewish population was murdered. In others the casualties were fewer. It wouldn't be a mistake to describe the Jewish casualties as just being part of the overall results of war killings. As we said, Nazi Germany's measures against the Jews were driven from genocidal ideology, which saw the annihilation of all Jews as the super goal promising the ultimate victory. But looking at those figures, you must understand by now that the percentage of Jewish life lost in any given country was influenced by many factors. It was not only Nazi ideology or the manner in which the anti-Jewish steps were fulfilled. Neither was it an exclusive direct result of the various reactions of European societies to innate Nazism or to the occupation forces. In each and every country, special conditions and circumstances shape Jewish life and influenced the proportion of its death toll. And what about the Jews? Did they have any influence on their own situation? Could they change or escape the death sentence imposed on them by Nazi Germany and its direct or indirect assistants? We will not be able to answer this questions limiting ourselves to the Jewish reactions during the Holocaust. If we really want to study what Jews did or did not do in the small space of agency left to them by the German occupiers and shaped by their surroundings, we must study first, even briefly, something about those people before the war. Understanding the way private people in societies reacted to the reality which was imposed on them during the Holocaust could not be done without understanding their life before the tragedy. For example, we'll not be able to understand or dilemmas without knowing the complex and multiple of European Jewries before the war. And it will be hard, if not impossible, to dive into changes or continuity of daily life in ghettos, camps, and other settings with no awareness of the nature of daily life in regular times. Last but not least, without some sense of the many different aspects of life European Jews were part of before the Holocaust, politics, culture, art, literature, science, and more, we will not be able even to begin understanding the impact of their annihilation and thus the enormous and terrifying influence of the Holocaust. So who were those European Jews? Who were those fathers, mother, children, who in few years or months will find themself as victims of an unprecedented crime? In this narrow framework, we will not be able to describe the long history of the Jewish people or define European Jewry. We will just point out the major changes which occurred in the Jewish world in modern times and dedicate the last part of today's lessons to the Jews of Europe between the two world wars. In 1880, 88% of all Jews in the world lived in Europe. Almost 75% of them lived in its eastern parts of the continent, which were at the time under Russian rule. Only 3.3% lived in North America. In 60 years, those figures would change dramatically. In 1939, almost a third of the world Jewish population lived in the United States. East European Jews accounted for less than 50% of world Jewry. And hundreds and thousands of Jews lived in West European countries, more than 100,000 in Netherlands, 300,000 in France, and more than half a million in Germany and so on. True, the two largest communities were still in the east, more than 3 million in Poland on the eve of the Second World War and 3 million in the Soviet Union. But unlike 60 years earlier, large numbers of Jews now lived in each and every European country. The far-reaching changes within the Jewish world were not limited to the distribution of the Jews throughout the continent. Daily life, Jewish appearance, and their connection with non-Jewish world underwent a true transformation. Jews were part of a rapid modernization process which swept the Western world since the end of the 18th century and actually shared all its many aspects for better or for worse. In modern times, and as part of the Jewish emancipation granting them equal civil rights in many countries, Jews ceased to be a closed-off community with narrow and defined mainly economic connections with its surroundings. They had much greater geographic mobility. Many restrictions imposed on them in the past were cancelled, enabling them to become part of the general openization process in Europe. Hundreds of thousands of Jews in the east left small settlements, shtetls, for big cities. But mobility also had a social aspect. Many occupation forbidden for Jews in the past were now, at least theoretically, opened. And Jews could be part of many different strata of the general society and not only of the Jewish one. On the one hand, this promised many new opportunities. On the other, the traditional Jewish community, which in the past was formed on the basis of religious life and created a social Jewish formation, was deeply shaken. As part of this secularization process and influenced by various intellectual movements, Jews redefined their Judaism. They started to see their commitments to practical commandments of the Jewish religion or their brotherhood with the wall Jewry in a different light. Names were changed and Jewish traditional appearance were exchanged for more modern ones. Those changes were grasped by some religious leaders as very dangerous. And an alternate movement emerged as a reaction to those new liberal Jewish tendencies. Thus all of those groups, Reforms, Conservative, Neolog, or Orthodox were modern Jewish reactions. Each think itself as a true expression of Judaism. It's their movement which will return Judaism to its former glory. Parallel to those changes, other general winds of change which flourished in Europe left their mark on the Jewish world. Some Jews joined and even took key roles in national or social movements. Others adapted those new notions, infuse them in Jewish meaning, Jewish socialism, or Jewish nationality, Zionism. The collapse of the multi-ethnic empires at the end of World War I drew a new European map. Now Jews became citizens of various new or old European states based on the principle of ethnic nationhood. Thus, they were dragged into internal and external disputes. Facing modernity, the European Jewish world had undergone tremendous changes, emancipation, secularization, urbanization, and internal European immigration, which change each and every aspect of their lives. In one way or another, Jews were still part of the diverse Jewish community, Orthodox or Progressive. Yet now, unlike the past, they were also citizens, and in many cases proud and involved citizens of various European countries. And this raised many and very interesting identity questions for them as individuals and as part of a larger community. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nurture-market-strategies/lecture/BGs69/engagement-example-old-spice","Engagement Example: Old Spice","The Old Spice Manly Man program is a great example of viral engagement marketing. What I really like, and what you'll see as you go through the video, is how fast it went viral. In a matter of days it became a massive program with deep impact into their target market. Also was an interesting way that they did two-way relationship building, even though it was an anonymous relationship. Using Facebook and Twitter, they had people send in questions for the Manly Man, and then they shot late night responses on video and ran them the next day. So you could actually give them a question and they respond, even though they didn't know exactly who you were. The other thing I like about this program is, it was multi-media. It used every level in the social pyramid to impact their target market. What happened was Old Spice came out with a new line of body washes and they found it they went to males they would likely ignore the product. So instead they went to females with boyfriends and husbands that they want to smell good. Essentially their target market was to women and that became the base for the Old Spice Manly Man program. And so what they did is they started with the Manly Man commercial. Now it's important to understand the first thing they did is they release it on YouTube and Vimeo. They didn't put it on TV. Instead they let it start going viral and then they went and put it on television. And really because it has all the characteristics of being an awesome concept, it was something that was really relevant and it was very, very unique in its time and, as a result, it went viral. So, here's the original campaign. >> Hello ladies. Look at your man. Now back to me. Now back at your man. Now back to me. Sadly, he isn't me. But if he stopped using lady scented body wash and switched to Old Spice, he could smell like he's me. Look down, back up. Where are you? You're on a boat with the man your man could smell like. What's in your hand? Back at me, I have it. It's an oyster with two tickets to that thing you love. Look again, the tickets are now diamonds. Anything is possible when your man smells like Old Spice and not a Ladies, I'm on a horse. [MUSIC] >> The interesting thing is, while they did talk about the scent of the product, notice they didn't try to sell the product. They sold the experience, and they sold to women, and made it a lot of fun to watch. And one of the things you see, whether you're looking at Cadbury Chocolates or this example, cuz he didn't give you a lot of information about the product but it was the experience which was the thing and having engagement. What they did is, they then went multimedia. If you go out even today the Old Spice and the Manly Man are on Facebook. They have all their own Twitter sites. They did the video responses. He has his own blog to answer questions. He has his own website. And they're even on Wikipedia. And the key is they have all sorts of interesting things that are fun to do that don't really sell the product, but they sell the image of the product and they sell Old Spice. So they're really positioning the brand using the Manly Man and even today, years later, it is still a staple that they're using to sell products, and these are very, very popular sites. I'd encourage you to go on social and look for them in Twitter, look for them on Facebook, and so forth, to see what they're doing because it is a great example of how to engage from marketing over a period of time to a high value target market. One of the things they did, as we talked about earlier, is they shot answers to questions that people gave them on Twitter and Facebook. So I want to show you this video where they are actually doing that, and you can see the fun that they have. The other thing that's important is at the end they are going to talk about the impact that this program made as it went viral. And the key is notice there are a lot of social metrics. They also told about the fact that they sold a lot of product but they were also doing in store promotions and other sorts of things to promote it in addition to the social. But the social had a huge impact on positioning the product, as well as a huge impact in terms of driving people to the store to purchase it. So here's how they strengthened the relationship, even though it was an anonymous relationship on the social sites. >> By July of 2010, the Old Spice guy was a cultural phenomenon. On the heels of this overwhelming success, a encore performance was a no brainer. But Old Spice wanted something more engaging. How could the man your man could smell like have a conversation with his fans on a more intimate, personal level? >> [SOUND] You tell me. >> And so the response campaign was born. In two and a half days, a team of creative digital strategists, developers, and producers filmed 186 video responses to fans and celebrities. Polled from questions on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and more. These personalized real-time messages were then posted on YouTube, but the campaign also extended to Twitter, oldspice.com, and Facebook. Sparking a sensation that would become the fastest growing and most popular interactive campaign in history. >> Alyssa Milano tweets. Tori asked on Facebook. Dear Huffington Post. Oh hello, dangerous prairie wolf. >> No I can't go hunting with you today, I'm talking to the internet. >> My body is 98% muscle, and muscles can't get sick. Underwater dental hygenistry, I then whip him with his own shirt until death. This voicemail is now done. [SOUND] >> On day one, the campaign received 5.9 million YouTube views, more than Obama's victory speech after 24 hours. On day 2, Old Spice had 8 out of the top 11 most popular videos on the web. By day 3, the campaign eclipsed 20 million views. And 1 week post-launch, the work had been seen more than 40 million times. During this time, the brand's Twitter following increased 2700%. Facebook fan interaction went up 800%. Traffic to Oldspice.com increased 300% and Old Spice became the number 1 all-time most viewed branded channel on YouTube with 65 million campaign views. Best of all the work helped to double sales Old Spice body wash cementing Old Spice as the number one brand of body wash for men. >> [SOUND] Again notice that there a lot of the metrics were basically social metrics but the points made. You see how fast viral happened and how much fun they had. Again it was very, very awesome to watch it. And to be a part of it. And as a result, people told other people exactly like them, which is the definition of viral, to come watch. And as a result, it became one of the biggest campaigns of all time. The reason I like to use this is, not only does it have all the components of the strategy but it's also something that is around today. So you can go out and watch it, and they're using it now, the same figures, if you will, to promote other products. And so, the other thing, and so what they did, is they kept a relationship going. One of the things you need to notice is that when they put it out on YouTube and Vimeo, and this is a Vimeo one, up in the corner they always have a way to tell your friend. So one of the things that's really important, if you want something to go viral, make it very visual, and make it easy for me to tell others like myself About it. And that way you encourage it to go viral. So why, one of the reasons they release it on YouTube and Vimeo first, was allow the viral to happen. And it certainly happened here. So what can we learn? First off, If you hit the target market, you can really have an impact. They wanted to sell to young men, but they really went after the women who loved them, and that worked very well. Multimedia's a must. One of the things you wanna think about Is where is your target market in the social pyramid? And then hit them where they're at, and use multimedia to its best advantage. Even if you're just doing say an article, take a few minutes and shoot a one minute video about the key points of your article and put that out. You can also do an audio version, you know there is a lot of different ways we can get the message out to the different people who like those sorts of media. So a multimedia approach is a must. And then this, this particular one is traditional channels from Nascar to TV to radio to spread the message. And so when we think about an engagement social strategy we're gonna use every channel with our disposal to get to our target market. I also think the use of real time was smart and you saw that also with the Cadbury chocolate. The key is using Twitter responses, really made it fun for people to ask questions about a product that they probably had never considered. And it made it more of a social thing, as opposed to actually talking about the product itself. It made it just fun. And then when you went into the store to buy body wash, Old Spice came to mind. It went viral very, very effective that way. And the key is it was sustainable. This program ran for a long time, and in addition, it still is popular today. So what does it mean for you? First off, think about being awesome. If you want something to go viral, it's gotta be visual, it's gotta be relevant, but more importantly it's gotta be fun. Also consider a two-way conversation. While Cadbury chocolates was a patient market, this one was a hybrid of both a patient and trigger event, but even so, creating the two way conversation made it fun. And fun and making it engaging is really the central part of an engagement strategy. Multimedia across the entire social pyramid was the key thing here and it's something you ought to think about for everything that you're doing trying to reach a market and social. One of things though that is a problem is that it's difficult to replicate viral. In other words while the Manly Man, or the man you want your man to smell like character is still around, it's not as effective now as it was at the beginning, why? Because awesomeness happens once. And then afterwards it's, while it's still interesting, it doesn't become awesome again. So it does show you that there is a limit to how you can do this. But the key is if you constantly are putting out great contents, or like Cadbury Chocolates and Old Spice You can keep an audience very, very motivated over time. It won't have the initial viral yet. But the relationship will be maintained as long as you keep giving them highly relevant and interesting sorts of media and content. So finally thing is that there's selling without selling. If you watch both of these case examples they aren't really selling you the product they sell the experience. They sell you the fun and that position is a product in your mind. And so if you look at a lot of engagement marketing, it really is product positioning so that you will be ready to sell to them when they are ready to buy. And so that's really a key construct of most of these great programs is we're actually giving people information and experiences. Not trying to sell them products and services. Try to sell them and the community will leave, help the community along and they'll stay with you for the long term. And you'll see that is a mantra that goes through all three of these social strategies. Don't sell, help the community, do what the community wants to do.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nurture-market-strategies/lecture/1IKLu/getting-your-paid-toolkit","Getting Your Paid Toolkit","Hi, and welcome to your MOOC, I wanted to take a few minutes to talk about the paid tool kits. I put out the picture of the lady who's yelling where's the beef, you guys, one of the things I find interesting is there's a lot of people will join on Monday and wonder where the toolkit is on Tuesday. So, I what I want to do is just give you the flows and the timings that you're going to have, and so I want to focus on the paid tool kits. The free tool kits are basically on your MOOC, and they're located either in pieces like they do in MOOC one or as just one big download, and so we made those really available because they're open to everybody. The paid tool kits contain extra Ebooks, extra chapters, it also has special things with the MOOC 2 technologies that allow things to happen. But the flow is the same. So, I want to go through that so you understand it. When you join, what happens is, we get you into the class, we start the MOOC. And then what happens is, when you join the class. They are divided into whether you are in the specialization, you paid for a single MOOC, the one you're in now, or your financial aid scholarship. And what happens is that is held at Coursera. And what they do is each Wednesday they release to us a list of the paid students, specialization and paid people. They send it to Northwestern the problem is if you're in there and you join on Tuesday, you're probably not going to make the Wednesday batch, because they won't be able to go through and process the credit card and things like that. There are also people that it gets caught up in their system because maybe it was the wrong credit card number or something needs to be adjusted. So during that time, it doesn't come out but everyday we receive a list from them of everybody in the course who has cleared their processing and is ready to go. And so, what we do is we take it here at Northwestern and we then here on Friday, we'll send out the information. Now what this is is the email for one, three, four, and five. It's the email that gives you the toolkit, and what it does is we take it on Friday, we send it to you, the email does not come from Coursera, that's really important. The address will be Social Marketing MOOC and it says, Do-not-reply-social-marketing-mooc@northw- estern.edu, and that's what it comes to. So when you join every Friday you want to take a look and see when that toolkit gets there, in fact, we do the same process I guess you'll see in MOOC 2 but this is the bulk paid toolkit that you'll be getting. So, couple important notes, if we don't get everyone by the first Wednesday, so generally we think by week two we've got most of the people by Friday of that week we get everybody but there maybe some that are laggards. With that because we're making you a laggard. Everybody who comes in on Wednesday gets mail by Friday. But if they don't come in, and if there's something wrong, we can't change that, all right? Generally we send them out the first couple of weeks of the MOOC because I said usually it's front loaded. If you don't get one immediately, please don't create a thread. Or even worse, complain on Twitter? As we have to wait til the email clears. We're not penalizing you but it kind of, really gripes me. Some people joined on Tuesday, and then on Wednesday, they're out there doing 50 tweets about how much they hate it. It's like hey, we're going as fast as we can. So if you don't get one by the end of class, let us know. And we'll go through and by do that put it on the trouble shooting discussion boards. We're here to take care of you we want to make sure you get it too. But if things get caught up if there's a problem with their processing, we don't have any say in it but we will react as fast as we can. One other thing, for a couple weeks now I've been asking people to send in their stuff if they don't have the toolkits. And one of the things I'm finding is about 60% of them are in your Spam filters. In other words, because it comes from socialmarketingmooc@donotreply, sometimes it goes right to Spam. So here's the deal each Friday, go out and look at your spam and see if it's in there. If you see it, then you could immediately recover it, and a lot of people have it in there, they just don't realize it. So this is a process flow for one, three, four and five. You join the class every Wednesday, we get the list. The Wednesday lecture in by Friday you will get the toolkit. And that's the way it works. For the pay people in MOOC two it's a little, it's the same process as you notice at the top, you join the class, each Wednesday we get a list each Friday we send it to you, okay? It comes over just like the the other pay tool kits for one, three, four and five. However, on that same Wednesday we then take a paid list of the paid participants that are unique for that week and we send it to Lexalytics and we send a list of paid participants to send to IBM the same that people are on both of the list and the key is what they do is by the next week they go through and do their processing. What they do is Lexalytics has to match you up, they then put you, give you an activation code and some additional things to use with Semantria. IBM matches you up to a promo code that they have in their system, they've got over a million of them, and then you have to get the unique one to you. And what it does is it allows you to extend Bluemix from one to six months. The key is it takes some time, because one of the things that they do that's really important, is part of our contract was that they have to support this for a year. The second part of the contract is, they're not to call you. And so they put you on suppression lists as well as a support suppression list with the idea that if you need support you come through the Coursera site. And they make sure that they never advertise to you, that they never use that email for anything. And they're very strict on that, and I like that. And so we try to keep it as separate as we can. A couple things that's really important to note. For both the other one, on the paid toolkits for one, three, four, and five, and this one. We use the email address you use to register for Coursera. And I've had some people say, well I want to use my business address or I want to use a another address. It doesn't work that way. The contract we have for Lexalytics and for IBM says the only emails we want from Coursera for paid people with the email that they use for Coursera. So if you want to use a different one, you're going to have to create another ID at Coursera and go back through to get it because we can't change it. There's no facility to change it, we don't want to do that either. We don't want to mess with your stuff. So whatever you've been using to get to the course is what you're going to get. Now the key thing is that if you see something, if you see our email come to you on Friday and MOOC two, you know that by next Wednesday the following Wednesday you'll get the Lexalytics and the IBM emails so what you want to do is after you get the one on Friday then start watching on Wednesday for an email from Lexalytics and an email from IBM. Again, those will go to spam filters. So what you do is you look for them. You're going to either get it Wednesday, maybe Thursday or Friday but almost all the time that I've seen it goes out on Wednesday. And so here's some things, if after that Wednesday and you know you've got it on Friday and the following Wednesday you don't have it. Go out to the discussion boards for trouble shooting and just tell me. Let me know your email address, we'll try to figure it out. Do not go out on Twitter and start griping to everyone in the world about the fact that you don't have an invite that's probably in your spam filter, let us work it through with you and figure out what's going on. But the key is, it will come within Wednesday, Thursday or Friday depending on how they're processing it through. But they're working on it as fast as they can. So everybodys dedicated to getting you the really best information and to get those toolkits as fast as we possibly can. The key though is we have to work within the constraints of what Coursera has set up and the way they're processing things. So we just ask your indulgence, it's basically Wednesdays and Fridays are the key days when you see that first Friday tool Kit come for number two you know the next Wednesday you're going to get the one Lexalytics and one from IBM. So, those are the flows, we just wanted to let you know if you have a difficulty or you need some help, go into the discussion boards. Do not go into Twitter and we'll be happy to help you. Thank you very much.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nurture-market-strategies/lecture/4dAdk/how-startups-and-small-businesses-can-use-the-engagement-marketing-social","How Startups and Small Businesses Can Use the Engagement Marketing Social Strategy","When we're studying the engagement marketing strategy, one of the things that came up is people that are start-ups or they own a small business, they're saying look, I don't have millions to spend like Old Spice and Cadbury Chocolates. I mean, what could I do as a small business owner with limited money and limited resources to maximize my impact, and that's a real fair question. And so what I want to do is to give you four ideas of what you could do, but the key thing to think about is in this course, we started with developing your professional persona. And part of what we're doing is we're identifying influencers and we're trying to build a relationship with the influencers, eventually to sell a blog, if you will, to them, but the key is, it's going to be the same sort of process. Essentially, you have a market out there that is really starved for information. And you want to get them good stuff. You want them to come to you. You think about how you're going to build your personal persona. It's going to be the same way you'd want to do your business as a start up. So I've got four ideas for you to consider. The first one is think filter and focus. One of the things is that you don't have time to develop a lot of your own content. You don't have the money to do it. So think about developing thought leadership using influencers and experts. If you can do it, and many people do, you can have a blog and you can have guest bloggers. You could interview them with an audio interview or a podcast. Or maybe even invite them to a meet-up. In other words, you don't have to be the sole source of inspiration and knowledge. Why don't you find the best people, and ask them to talk to your audience, that are your customers and your prospects, as a way of doing it? You can certainly do it in print. But think about audios and podcasts and meet-ups and blogs as in other ways to do it. Another thing that works really well is when you do invest your time and resources, go for maximum impact. For example, if you're a security company or a privacy company, the FBI versus Apple controversy that's going on now gives you ample ways to begin to tell people what your position is on those sorts of issues. And so if you're going to invest, try to get something that's going to have maximum bang for the buck in your particular target market. Invest in major topics or what I call sudden issues that come up, which gives you the really strong impact in the market that you want to develop, and keep an eye out for it. Again, a lot of these come up fairly quickly. But if they do, and it works for you, and you can make a good investment and do something really interesting and neat, that's going to be a great way to do it. So, invest for maximum impact. Next, use influencers. One of the things that a lot of companies do is, and I do to myself, is I get guest bloggers, and by doing that, they bring their audience to you and they get a little bit more exposure out there. You know, and you also give of something like thought leadership articles, things that really position them well, they're looking for places to put it. And so, becoming open to that and maybe even approach them to say hey, I'd like to do something with you and what can we do to make that all happen? The final thing is, think about the social pyramid and multi-use. One of the things that kind of drives me nuts with startups and small business is they'll invest a lot of their time and resource to write an article, and then they stop there, they put it out on your website and they're done. First off, think marketing and just like you're going to be doing with your blog, you ought to be going out and testing messages and sending it out with the hash tags that the groups use on twitter, use the key words, send it out to the influencers to get maximum impact. But never do just one media type. In other words, if you write an article, then do what we recommended in the courses and then go through and put it out as an audio, and put it out as a video. Go out and put bullet points out on a slideshare. And go the maximum way to get as much exposure as you can. You use your Bentley lease to analyze and link up things. And the key is your video and your audio should be very short and the bullet points, but it should all point back to your print article and to your website. And think about doing that. Also as you're doing it, think about having a registration page where people love your blog, for example. Most of them, like WordPress, has a free thing where you could actually have the people put in their email address and now you're developing lists of people. Think how you could do more with less. There's a lot of free things that are out there to make it work. Also get all the cheap media you can. For example, a lot of people go out and put things on YouTube, but they don't go out to Vimeo, and for $199, you can get a pretty big Vimeo system, which you give you a lot of ways to put out video. And so, think about how you might do it, and think about where they at in the social pyramid. If they're on things like, you know, we chat things, chat up there. Talk about it. Tell them what you're doing. Figure out all the ways you can get to your target market effectively. Use the social tools we've given you to identify hashtags and key words. When you put up a video, put up the right key words so you get maximum SEO. And so what you want to do is to think smart and build stuff out that really help you go big and appear much bigger than you are. But because you know how to do give to get and filtered focus, it allows you to build your business quickly and really work well. And one other thing, one of the books that I use in my class is The Lean Startup. I would recommend if you can to get that, it's by Eric Ries, R-I-E-S. The neat part about The Lean Startup is he talks about it in terms of a-b split testing and how you pivot fast if things aren't working the way you want to. So it gives you another way of thinking about how you startup and I like the fact that he starts with understand the market, which is just the way we do it here in this class as well. And then go from there. So anyway, think about these four tips. And, you know, go out there and try to do it with as minimum amount of investment as you can for maximum impact. You can do it.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nurture-market-strategies/lecture/LHr5m/engagement-example-cadbury-dairy-milk","Engagement Example: Cadbury Dairy Milk","Cadbury Dairy Milk is a great example of engagement marketing that happened a while back but you're gonna see the power of how engagement works over time from a really experienced and a great company to look at. The thing I really like about what they've done is they are developing people who are passionate about chocolate and really engaging them in a whole series of things that are very, very relevant and fun for the group to do, in other words, it's really great, awesome content, and the other thing I really illustrate is the idea of the community goal. They went out to the community, and said, hey, we want to accomplish this goal if you help us we will then celebrate it so you get to see how all of that works together. A little bit of background Cadbury is a UK company and in 2010-2011 they said we want to maximize our impact on Facebook and our goal is very simple. We want to have a million likes. And they went out to the community and they said, when this is accomplished, we're going to have a big celebration for everyone. And so, what they did is they had a whole lot of really interesting things that they did with chocolate, having people send in ideas and they would make things and do things. In doing so, that would go viral and more and more people would like them. And so by the end of 2011, they reached their goal of a million likes. And so this is gonna show you what they did. So what they did is their target market was chocolate lovers. It's a patient market. They build chocolate cars, houses and other things to get people going, and of course every time they did that it went viral. They ran a contest for children, promoted activities they could do with chocolate, and you had of course a lot of great recipes and things like that. And the goal was to get to this one million Likes. And so here's what happened when they did. When they got to a million Likes, they decided to do a 45 hour build of a giant chocolate thumb which is the Like symbol for Facebook. And the celebration was streamed live, so during the 48 hours, they did a whole lot of different activities in addition to building the thumb. And so as you recall in engagement marketing relationship, it's anonymous. So what they did is they asked people to post on Facebook different suggestions, and you're gonna see that as you watch the video. Watch the back wall. There's essentially a comment wall where people said we'll make a cake, or do this, or say hi to this, or go do something else, and the key was they put those on the wall, then during the course of the 48 hours, they would actually do them. That kept people watching, and they found a lot of people watch for the entire four 48 hours. But what you're gonna see here is a video of them making the thumb and the celebrations that they went through. [MUSIC] Okay, that was the actual celebration. There are a lot of activities that went before that, and a lot of things that happened after that. But notice how they really involved the people that were watching in the entire process. In fact, behind them you had the wall which you see here on the left. People send in their congratulations. They can also ask them questions, or request them to do things, that were going. So, in other words, while it was an anonymous two way dialogue, the dialogue happened. In fact if you go back and watch, it actually talks to somebody named Laura, who had sent in the request to make the cake. And so the key is, they've made it very very personal, even though they really don't know who you are. And that's really one of the hallmarks of engagement is you're engaging with people that are in a certain patientary or certain trigger event in their lives. You don't necessarily have to know who they are, and if you have the right kind of products this works really well. But the key is notice how they made it two way even though it was an anonymous relationship with the people. And so the key though, is that they kept doing it. And so they hit a million people, now they're up to 12 million today. And one of the things I'd encourage you to do is to go out to Cadbury Dairy Milk on Facebook. What you're gonna find is all sorts of things that are very engaging to that passion market. They give them recipes, they give you ideas, they show you different things to do. Lot of seasonal things, things for your kids, things for you as an adult. And all sorts of different ways of using chocolate and they just make it fun, they make it really engaging and really interesting. And so the key was, the celebration itself had 35,000 people involved with the campaign, 40,000 new Facebook fans had did it while it's happening so as a result they were actually going out virally. And the increase in Facebook participation from 16% to 33% because of all the events. So what they were doing was they were measuring engagement as it happened and they were putting on a lot of different content really designed for people passionate about chocolate and encouraging them through the celebration and the setting of community goals. We want to hit a million of getting more and more people to come in in other words excited people on Facebook went out and got their friends and brought them over so that they could eventually have the celebration which you just saw. So what does it tell you? First off it worked because it was very broad targeting, there are a lot of people that are chocolate lovers to do it. It was extremely relevant. They made it really an interesting thing to do to actually build the giant thumb. They also gave coupons and special offers to people who buy the chocolate. So, they make it really relevant for the people who are chocolate lovers. They made it fun, as a great way to engage the markets in that two way interaction. And it was very, very creative. And those are the sort of things that people gravitate towards. They really enjoy doing it as they move forward. So what does this mean for you? Well as you're going through and thinking about your engagement strategy the key is to make it two way. Ask people for their opinions especially if you're in a patient market. Get that two way dialogue happening even though you don't know who they are. And try to make it as fun as you can. The key is people like to do things that are unique. They also like to set goals and work towards it as a team, you and them. If that's appropriate, that's a great idea for you. And so the thing I like about Cadbury is it was very effective engagement marketing. That not only worked back in 2011, but is working for them today. So go ahead and follow them on Facebook and kind of watch what they're doing. It's a great ongoing lesson in how to do engagement marketing.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nurture-market-strategies/lecture/l35yq/engagement-marketing-social-strategy","Engagement Marketing Social Strategy","[MUSIC] Engagement marketing strategy is the strategy used by most companies today. It is quick to develop, easy to measure and effective in certain types of markets. However, this strategy does not produce bottom line business metrics like ROI. As you will see, engagement marketing works, if you want to develop a socially focused, anonymous relationship with your target market. There are two types of engagement marketing strategies. The Go Viral version is designed to reach a target market with content that is so awesome they will tell all of their friends about it. Your awesome content moves though the target market like a virus to maximize your market impact. While ideally, everyone wants a viral campaign, most don't reach viral levels. But when it works, it is amazing to watch, which we will do in this MOOC. Another application of engagement marketing is to gather a target market to your social media asset. Your objective will be to draw a target market using relevant content, and then maintain the relationship with new content designed specifically for them. Regardless which variation you use. Both of there engagement marketing strategies are designed to build your social networks. With the markets you want to engage. Both have a goal of maximizing followers, likes, or links. To compare and contrast our three social strategies, we will use this table. Here are the characteristics of the engagement marketing strategy. The goal of engagement is to grow your social footprint in your target market. Engagement produces an anonymous relationship with your target market. This means you can communicate with them using their social handle. While you might know some of them personally over time, the engagement marketing strategy does not create a database to track individual relationships. The focus of our content offerings will be to create something awesome for the market, the objective is to have the content go viral. Finally the metrics will be social. As you will see with our examples later in this MOOC, they describe success in terms of the percentage growth of followers and other key social metrics. Businesses and organizations use a five step process to develop an engagement marketing strategy. First, we identify and use social monitoring to deeply understand the target market we want to develop. Next, we create awesome content to engage with them. Then we develop a go viral marketing program. To reach the members of our target market and make them aware of our content. As they begin to enjoy our content, we will strengthen the relationship by creating follow-up content or develop ways to have fun, engaging our target market. Finally, we will use social metrics to identify the success of the strategy. While we will overview all five steps in this video, we will be addressing the Go Viral marketing plan and the success metrics. In more detail in MOOC 5. As you will see, these components are common to all three social strategies. In developing your target market, you want to use social monitoring tools and interviews with customers to determine the following factors. First, is it a passion or a trigger event market and what are the challenges they are addressing? Identifying the type of community will tell us a great deal about the type of content that will best engage them. Next, we want to learn where they are congregating on social. Do they meet in communities? Where they are engaging with each other? Or are they engaging with experts? Who are addressing their concerns? Finally, what topics are they discussing? And who are the influencers and experts? Leading the discussion, the more we can understand about our target market the more effective our engagement content will be. In book one, we examine the difference between in passion and trigger event communities. It will be useful to review those videos. To see how they impact your engagement, marketing strategy. When I teach viral content, I like to use a definition developed by the social site upworthy. They have found that viral content occurs when you address three parameters. First, it must be meaningful to the target market. It must address their needs and what they are seeking. Second, it must be awesome. That means it must be unique, and something they have not seen before. It might be a new tool, a webinar, a video or other types of content.The key is the more unique and fun it is, the more it will impact your target audience market. Finally it must be visual, while we can use texts and other less visual content to gather a target market. Visual content is best for viral to occur. Watching content takes little time. It's easier to send to your friends and colleagues. And it is fun to discuss. In our best of examples, you'll see viral engagement content which meets these three conditions. In creating our gold viral marketing program. There's one aspect I want to emphasize now. Many executives think social marketing means placing great content on a site, and then waiting for your target market to discover it. Nothing could be further from the truth. In all our social strategies, We will use a combination of social, web and traditional media to reach our target market. In an effective social marketing program you need to create and manage the buzz to maximize the impact of your content. Next, we want to entertain and engage your audiences to strengthen a relationship. In one case example, Old Spice had them send comments and requests using Twitter and Facebook. Old Spice created fun videos addressing their request. In another example, Cadbury used a communication wall where people could send in requests. The key is to keep the market involved with you on your social asset. Finally, we will want to major our results because engagement marketing provides an anonymous relationship. Companies used social metric to show the impact of their social investment, because growing your social footprint does not directly relate to revenues and profits Most companies using the engagement marketing strategy, rely on surveys and the intuitive value of social to justify their investment. For example, some companies use post-purchase surveys to determine the role social played in the purchase process. Now, that you've had a quick overview of the engagement marketing strategy [MUSIC] Watch the next video for our best of breed example. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/nurture-market-strategies/lecture/2hwD5/social-strategies-used-by-organizations-today","Social Strategies Used by Organizations Today","[MUSIC] The goal of this MOOC is to educate you on the three social strategies used today. While there are millions of variations as these strategies are deployed throughout the world. The objectives, methodologies,and limitations are universal. Each of these strategies will work regardless of the type of organization you are in or want to develop and regardless of the size and nature of your target markets. When you think about social marketing. There are three different types of strategies. Engagement marketing is designed to engage with markets using social networking sites. Your goal is to attract people to your organization's social assets and maintain contact with them. Nurture marketing and Social IMC are very different. They are designed to target high value markets and build long term relationships with them. As you will see these two strategies will link customers and prospects to your marketing system to follow the social relationship from start to finish. Both can provide you with business metrics, like profits and return on investment or ROI. We will examine engagement marketing and nurture marketing in this MOOC. In MOOC 4, we will examine the Social IMC strategy. As we explore all three strategies, keep in mind these important points. First, each of the strategies is developed to achieve a different type of organizational goal. You will want to implement the strategy which best matches what you want to accomplish with each of your target markets. Second, each also develops different relationships with your target markets. One is to engage them on social. One develops a sales driven relationship. And one builds a community focused one to one relationship. For most of you, the nature of the relationship will be the key consideration in selecting your social strategy. Third, each strategy uses different types of metrics to determine success. One focuses on social metrics like followers and likes. One focuses specifically on sales. And one is more focused on business metrics. Finally, each strategy has different levels of investment. The key is to consider how management will judge success and select the best strategy to justify your investment. Before we begin examining the engagement marketing strategy. It is important to emphasize you will likely use all three strategies to best grow your market share and develop strong relationships with your customers and your prospects. Our goal is not to tell you which one to use, but to give you the insights and knowledge to select the best strategy. Now let's get started with engagement marketing. But first, Tweet this message.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/business-of-social/lecture/PtOvC/getting-your-paid-toolkit","Getting Your Paid Toolkit","Hi, and welcome to your MOOC. I wanted to take a few minutes to talk about the paid tool kits. I put up a picture of the lady who's yelling where's the beef because one of the things I find interesting is a lot of people will join on Monday and wonder where their tool kit is on Tuesday. So what I want to do is just give you the flows and the timings that you are going to have. And so I want to focus on the paid tool kits. The free tool kits are basically on your MOOC and they're located either in pieces like they do in MOOC one or as just one big download. And so we've made those really available because they're open to everybody. The paid tool kits contain extra ebooks, extra chapters it also has special things with the MOOC 2 technologies that allow things to happen, but the flow is the same. So I want to go through that so you understand it. When you join, what happens is we get you into the class, we start the MOOC, and then what happens is when you join the class they are divided into whether you are into specialization, you paid for a single MOOC, the one you're in now, or you're a financial aid scholarship. And what happens is that is held at Coursera. And what they do is each Wednesday, they release to us a list of paid students, specialization and paid people. They send it to Northwestern. The problem is if you are in there and you join on Tuesday, you're probably not going to make the Wednesday batch because they won't be able to go through and process the credit card and things like that. They're are also people that it gets caught up in their system because maybe it was the wrong credit card number or something needs to be adjusted and so during that time, if it doesn't come out. But every Wednesday we receive a list from them of everybody in the course who has cleared their processing and is ready to go. And so what we do is we take it here at Northwestern, and we then on Friday, we'll send out the information. Now what this is, is the email for one, three, four and five. It's the email that gives you the tool kit and when it does, we take it on Friday and give it to you. The email does not come from Coursera. That's really important. The address will be Social Marketing MOOC and it says do not reply socialmarketingmooc@northwestern.edu. And that's where it comes to. So when you join, every Friday you ought to take a look and see when that tool kit gets there. In fact we do the processes you'll see in MOOC 2. But this is the bulk paid tool kit that you'll be getting. So a couple important notes. If we don't get everyone by the first Wednesday, so generally we think by week two we've got most of the people and by Friday of that week we get everybody. But there may be some that are laggards. It's not because we are making you a laggard, everybody who comes in on Wednesday gets mail by Friday but if they don't come in and there's something wrong, we can't change that. All right? Generally we send them out the first couple of weeks of the MOOC. Like I said, usually it's front loaded. If you don't get one immediately, plus don't create a threat or even worse, complain on Twitter. As we have to wait until the email clears, we're not penalizing you. But it kind of really gripes me when people join on Tuesday and on Wednesday, they're out there doing 50 tweets about how much they hate it. It's like, hey, we're going as fast as we can. So if you don't get one by the end of class, let us know and we'll go through and by do that, put it on the trouble shooting discussion boards. We're here to take care of you. We want to make sure you get it too. But if things get caught up, if there's a problem with their processing, we don't have any say in it. But we will react as fast as we can. One other thing I for couple weeks now I've been asking people to send in their stuff if they don't have the tool kits, and one of those things I find in is about 60% of them are in your spam folders. In other words, because it comes from social marketing MOOC that do not reply, sometimes it goes right to spam. So here's the deal. At each Friday go out and look at your spam and see if it's in there, if you see it then you can immediately recover it and a lot of people have it in there they just don't realize it. So this is a process flow for one, three, four and five. You join the class, every Wednesday we get the list, the Wednesday that you're in by Friday you will get the tool kit. And that's the way it works. For the paid people at MOOC 2, it's the same process as you'll notice at the top, you join the class, each Wednesday we get a list, each Friday we send it to you, okay? It comes over just like the other paid tool kits for one, three, four and five. However, on that same Wednesday We then take a list of the paid participants that are unique for that week and we send it to Lexalytics and we said a list of paid participants is sent to IBM the same people are on both of the lists, and the key is what they do is by the next week, they go through and do their processing. What they do is Lexalytics has to match you up they then give you an activation code and some additional things to use with semantria. IBM matches you up to a promo code that they have in their system. They've got over a million of them and you have to get a unique one to you. And what it does is it allows you to extend Blue Mix from one to six months. The key is it take some time because one of the things that they do is really important is part of our contract was that they have to support this for a year. The second part of the contract is they're not to call you and so, they put you on suppression as well as support suppression list with the idea that if you need support, you come through the Coursera site. And they make sure that they never advertise to you that they never use that email for anything and they're very, very strict on that and I like that. And so we try to keep it is as you know as a separate as we can, a couple of things that's really important to note, for both the other one on the paid tool kits for one, three, four and five and this one. We use the email address you used to register for Coursera. And I've had some people say, well I want to use my business address, or I want to use another address. It doesn't work that way. The contract we have for Lexalytics and for IBM says, the only emails we want from Coursera for paid people with the email that they use for Coursera. So if you want to use a different one you're going to have to create another ID at Coursera and go back through to get it, because we can't change it. There's no facility to change it. We don't want to do that either, we don't want to mess with your stuff. So whatever you have been using to get to the course is what you're going to get. Now the key thing is that if you see our email come to you on Friday in MOOC 2, you know that by next Wednesday, the following Wednesday, you'll get the Lexalytics and the IBM emails. So what you want to do is after you get the one on Friday, then start watching on Wednesday, For an email from Lexalytics and an email from IBM. Again, those will go to spam filters. So what you do is you look for them. You're going to get a Wednesday, or maybe Thursday or Friday, but almost all the time I've seen it goes out on Wednesday. So here's some things. If after that Wednesday, if you know you've got about Friday and the following Wednesday you don't have it go out to the discussion boards for trouble shooting and just tell me, let me know your email address, we'll try to figure it out. Do not go out on twitter and start griping everyone in the world about the fact that you don't have an invite that's probably in your spam filter. Let us work it through with you and figure out what's going on. But the key is it'll come within, you know, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, depending on how they're processing it through. But they're working on it as fast as they can. So everybody's dedicated to getting you the really best information and to get those tool kits as fast as we possibly can. The key though is we have to work within the constraints of what Coursera has set up and the way they're processing things. So we just ask your indulgence. It's basically Wednesdays and Fridays are the key days. When you see that first Friday toolkit come for number two, you know the next Wednesday you're going to get the one from Lexalytics and one from IBM. So those are the flows. We just wanted to let you know if you have difficulty or you need some help, go into the discussion boards, do not go in Twitter, and we'll be happy to help you. Thank you very much.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/business-of-social/lecture/mcUEP/security-privacy-and-governance-pt-1","Security, Privacy, and Governance Pt. 1","[MUSIC] Ever since you viewed We Feel Fine, and looked at social big data in MOOC2, you've been discussing privacy on our discussion boards and on Twitter. To help you better understand the topic of privacy and social big data, I want to welcome Seth Redmore, the CMO of Lexalytics, who you met in MOOC2. Seth, welcome. >> Thanks, Randy. Happy to be here. >> How should we look at privacy? >> So I think that you should break it into three separate pieces. There's individual, and what you need to do to protect your privacy, There's a company and what they need to do in order to protect their users privacy and be transparent about their use of it. And then there's what's happening in various governments around the world and various territories, where privacy laws differ. >> So let's start with the consumer. As a consumer of social, what should I be looking for >> Whenever you install an application What's it asking for access to? Is it gonna be able to post your timeline? Is it getting all of your friends lists, is it collecting your location? So you have to be comfortable with what information is being collected, as well as Be comfortable with how that information may be used. And that will often, more and more companies are having a separate privacy policy that's separate from their overall terms and conditions. And so, take a look at that. >> Okay, and would it also be in the terms and conditions in some sites? >> Yes, absolutely. >> Okay, and then if I'm going to social networking sites like Facebook or Twitter, is that different than downloading an app? >> It is, in that Facebook and Twitter are inherently information sharing sites. You were talking on them and so you know Twitter unless you are in a close Twitter group or you're deleting a tweet. There isn't really much expectation of privacy there perse. You are shouting out to the world and you know you help to have a conversation. Mm-hm. >> Facebook is a little more complex in that they have a large set of rules and things that you can use to control privacy. But still, you know, you do need to be concerned about, okay, how much do I want to expose to whom? >> Ok that's good advice. What about if I'm a start up or I'm in a business? What are the business concerns relative to privacy? >> So, the best way to sum it up is say what you're gonna collect and then do what you say you're going to do with it. Don't collect more than you say you're going to and then don't use it in ways that you say you're not going to, we will never share third party data from this site. If you take that third-party data and you sell it to somebody, that can turn into you know an epic fail and you'll be pilloried on Twitter and bad things will happen. >> Ok, that makes sense. So I need to tell people what to do with the data I should also probably keep it really relevant to the relationship I want to develop with them? >> Yes, yes, absolutely. If you are building an application that's just a note taking application, do you really need to collect the GPS information? maybe you do, because maybe that's part of it, where it's just like hey we're going to geo tag everything, all your notes. You can say that this is a travel journal, if you will. If it's just a simple to do list, do you really need to know where I am? maybe you do, maybe you don't, but you should be careful and only collect the information that is directly relevant to experience you are trying to provide the user. Don't over reach. >> Okay, on two of our three social marketing strategies we have landing page, where we get Email address and then a password. And then we ask them a few questions, we say keep those really relevant. And then we give people opt out options for things like our blogs and so forth. Is that a good way to do it? >> Absolutely. Collecting minimum amount of information as you build the relationship. As the relationship goes on further you can collect more information, as there's trust and as there's an exchange of values. Right. So, you fill out name and email address. So I give you something of value at that point like a white paper. And then the next time maybe I get another couple of pieces of information. This is called progressive profiling. And at each step there's an exchange of value for you information. The things like opt out and opt in I tend to prefer opt in. As opposed to opt out, but those are important concepts. And that's a good way to handle it. >> Super. So that talks about the company and the consumer net relationship What about governmental and what are the regulations coming down about privacy? >> So, privacy is handled differently. In almost every country in the world. The EU is trying to have sort of this overall program. There was a program called Tape Harbor with the United States, that was recently overturned. Inside the United States, it's the Federal Trade Commission that actually manages the data. They're called the data protection authority. >> Okay >> Now, There's a lot of confusion about what we need to do. Lexalytics as a company, we actually spun up a data center in Ireland. We did this probably a year, year and a half ago, because some of our customers wanted to keep their information in the EU. But in other territories like China, these are places that have very specific Privacy laws, and so you need to understand that for each of the territories you're in. And given the nature of Cloud computing, it's relatively easy to take your application, spin it up here, spin it up here, spin it up here, spin it up here, so that you can actually adhere to the rules of each of those, of each of those territories. >> Okay so if I'm going global I really need to look at a lot of different countries to figure out exactly what I need to do. >> Yes. >> Okay, the other things is, this is changing a lot isn't it? It's pretty dynamic area in terms of privacy. >> Yes and like I said before the whole EU, United States safe harbor program, that's thrown a lot of people into, okay, what do I do now how do we handle this? The EU is trying to get their own things together. A lot of people think that the German ones which are quite strict. So it's the change Is going to be rapid for a while. >> Uh-huh. >> While the world gets a handle on what am I okay with, and what are government's okay with, in terms of data usage by a company? >> Well that's really interesting to see how privacy is being done differently across the globe And that it's something that is a big concern for a lot of governments. One of the things I really appreciate is you're going to give us, in our tool kits, links to places where we oughta go to learn the governmental side of this. >> Absolutely. >> And also some videos and other things to learn more about the whole issue of privacy. >> Yes. Thank you so much for these great tips. We really appreciate it. >> Thank you. Happy to be here. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/business-of-social/lecture/I8lhL/understanding-data-protection","Understanding Data Protection","[MUSIC] In MOOC One we introduced you to Social Big Data. You saw We Feel Fine and watched a TED talk on privacy. We then expanded our examination of Social Big Data in MOOC Two. There we saw how big data is transformed into big information which produces big insights. We not only looked at big data, we also begin to use it with a variety of tools designed to help you build insights about your high-value markets. Since that time, there's been an ongoing dialogue about big data and your privacy. This discussion has occurred on our discussion boards, as well as, on Twitter. Our social data experts, like Steve Dodd of Socialgist, Seth Redmore of Lexalytics and the experts from IBM, all reference privacy and the importance of data security. Before we talk with our privacy and security experts, it is important to provide you with a framework to view these topics. Often executives and marketers make little distinction between privacy and security, but they are very different issues. Privacy is concerned with our use of the data provided by community members. As you saw starting with We Feel Fine, there is a lot of data which is generated through our use of social sites. Privacy is our concern that the relationships we are developing on social are controlled by us and used in appropriate ways by community managers. We demand the right to privacy. Data security is different. In an embrace social marketing strategy, community members are supplying you with private and personal data. They are giving you their email addresses and passwords, answering key questions to help you define their needs within the community, and tracking data which monitors every one of their activities on your site forever. While community members are happy to provide this important relationship data, they do so on the assumption that it will be secure within your site. It isn't about use, but security. These two topics come together in a term Data Governance. It is aligning your people, business processes, and technology to secure the data and use it appropriately in your social and business engagement activities. We will also include links to groups and associations, as well as, least to experts in the toolkits accompanying this MOOC. Today, you need to be actively involved in the security and privacy of the data your community members provide you. Handle it well and it will be a win/win for you and your community members.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-social/lecture/R9CLE/introduction","Introduction","[MUSIC] Hello and welcome to the Social Marketing Specialization course developed by Northwestern University and Coursera. This five MOOC specialization is designed to give you the hands on experiences and expertise to develop profitable social marketing programs for your organization, regardless of its size. This program is based on a similar marketing program used today by the graduate and undergraduate students in the Northwestern Medel Integrated Marketing Communications, or IMC program. Over the last five years, our students have developed marketing programs for organizations ranging from start ups to large multinational corporations, for profit, not for profit, and governmental entities in markets ranging from global to the hyper-local. It is a course that will give you the skills, tools, and expertise to impact any market you want to develop. My name is Randy Hlavac. For the last nine years, I have been the instructor of the undergraduate and graduate Digital, Social and Mobile Marketing courses in the North Western Medill IMC program. Also, I am the author of the new book, Social IMC, Social Strategies with Bottom-Line ROI, or return on investment. This MOOC specialization is built around the contents of this book. While you don't need to purchase it, if you want more details or a written book to help you build your social strategies, this one's for you. Many of our speakers have written great books in their area of expertise. These, and other important books, can be found in our bookstore. You will find they represent a wide range of important specializations you need to build effective social marketing programs. Today, your prospects and customers are using social media to engage with each other to discuss personal and business topics. To succeed in social, you need to focus your resources in three related areas. First, you need to build your professional persona to connect with the markets you want to develop. Second, you need to manage your organizational persona. A recent study revealed medium sized organizations will have over 158 social phasings. You need the tools to monitor these social conversations, and the hands on experience to shape your teams' professional personas. Finally, you need the right social strategies to profitably grow your organization. As you will learn in this course, there are different social strategies. We will teach you how to match the right strategy with the different markets you want to develop. Our goal is to provide you with the hands on knowledge, skills, tools, and capabilities to begin growing your social marketing program starting with this MOOC. MOOC 1 will give you an overview of social and the frameworks you need to build successful social strategy. MOOC 2 is designed to give you the information, insights, and tools you need to listen to social conversations important to your organization. You'll receive free tools to immediately begin developing your social marketing programs, and you'll see how real-time social data is used to drive crisis management in real time marketing war rooms. MOOC 3 focuses on the engagement marketing and the nurture marketing strategies. MOOC 4 focuses on different types of content, how to use social networking sites to advertise to key markets, and the social IMC marketing strategy. This strategy has you building private virtual communities to create holistic, two way engagements. The final MOOC is on the business of social. We will start with the discussion on the legal considerations you need to build social marketing programs. We will follow it with an analysis of how you can measure, justify, and manage these programs. Our goal is to give you an in-depth education, heavily focused on hands-on experiences, and an examination of actual social programs, to let you determine the best ways to grow your organization. One of the most important things I learned In developing my Social, Digital, and Mobile marketing class was the importance of knowing the experts in key social fields. We are bringing this important lesson to you in this MOOC specialization. Every MOOC, starting with this one, will feature an array of knowledge experts in fields you need to understand. Many will be providing you with free tools and their expertise to help you build successful programs. In addition, each of these experts are people you need to follow on Social, and use as you develop your social programs. In each of our MOOCs, you'll find two social marketing toolkits, one for the participants who want to take the MOOC for free, and another for the participants who are paying for the individual MOOC, or have paid for the MOOC specialization. The paid member tool kit will have longer review periods, tools available only to the paid members, and special videos, eBooks and other content to better develop their social programs. Regardless of which way you choose to participate, both tool kits will give you the knowledge, skills, and information you need to be successful in this course. Finally, I want to leave you with something I say in every one of my classes. Have fun. Social is a great way to network, share, and build meaningful relationships with each other and with the markets you want to develop. We will show you the best ways to create this engagement, and we want you to use that knowledge every day to be a success. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-1/lecture/X26jq/focus-on-france-and-paris","Focus on France and Paris","[MUSIC] Welcome back. Our analysis of Nazi conduct in the annexed parts of Poland allowed us to meet and better understand some organizations and modes of action characteristic to Nazi Germany in general and which had a special role in the planning and implementation of anti-Jewish policies throughout Europe. Now let's take another concrete example, this time from the West, in order to present other important features of the Holocaust. Focusing on the occupation of France will help us in exposing the important triangle necessary for any understanding of the Holocaust. German policies, local reactions, Jewish experiences. As we have seen, France was occupied in mid 1940 and divided into two, the free zone in the south of France, Regime de Vichy and the occupied zone in the north of France under the direct German rule. Yet, in both parts, France and Germany were very visible. Though the Germans were setting the scene in general in the north and occupied zone, some French civil authorities continued to act over German occupied parts and no one in Vichy, France could have ignored the Nazi Germany's presence in the state that had until very recently been a democratic republic and a symbol of equal civil rights. Actually, for the German occupying forces, France was a symbol for a few important, yet somehow contradictory notions. First, the occupation of France was a sweet revenge on the historical enemy which humiliated Germany in the first World War. France capitulation was signed in the same rail road car in which Germany was forced to sign it's total surrender in the end of the first World War. Look how joyful Hitler looks in those pictures, he had a good reason. The battle in France, and in fact, the general attack on the West, was imposed by Hitler on the Vernacht. The rapid victory, and the few German casualties in this campaign became a proof of Hitler's military genius. Yet, occupied France, and especially Paris, had another meaning for many Germans, this was the City of Lights, not only a symbol of Western and European culture, but a beautiful place to visit. Paris became a tourist destination for many German soldiers, and German units were sent to Paris to relax and recover. But those pictures, though exposing German Paris, don't reveal how French citizens experienced the German occupation of their homeland. Beyond the prevailing shortage of food and other resources, the French could not be indifferent to the German occupation of their homeland. The country who raised the banner of freedom, equality, brotherhood, liberte, egalite, fraternite, fundamentally changed it's face. Strong Rightist traditions that had been part of the French culture, but that had been overshadowed by the liberal tradition, surfaced and gained support. During the years of the way, the famous motto which had shaped the ideals of democracy and freedom not only in France but in the whole world, was converted to work, family, fatherland. And the French authorities in Vichy, France, and in the occupied zone worked hand by hand with the occupying forces in too many aspects. How was this grasped at the time by non-Jewish French? >> Between 1940 and 1942, the majority of the French population did all it could to satisfy the demands of its German occupiers, even at the cost of allowing Germans into their cultural domains. The Germans were everywhere encouraging the French people with a vivid and intense propaganda campaign, with brochures and images in the written press, and in the cinema. German soldiers adapted very quickly to the Parisian way of life. Visiting Le Beaubien de Paris and Le Moulin Rouge, sitting in small taverns and cafes, enjoying the singing of Edith Piaf, Tino Rossi, and Les Compagnons de la chanson. True, there were those who joined the small, nascent resistant movement and many others passively resisted in other ways, such as listening to forbidden foreign radio broadcasts. However, many French became adapted to the German occupation and developed commercial connections with their occupier. One of the most significant problems for many French was the fact that the French government chose not resist the occupation for reason well documented. Thus France which is so well known for it's revolutions and strikes, felt nothing could be done since condemning their own government appeared senseless, especially with the very obvious and threatening German presence all over the country. Yet, with time, and especially from the summer of 1941, even French collaborators witnessed how their situation deteriorated. Families were torn apart in the different occupied zones, salaries were not paid while prices were rising and the collaborative occupation became a straightforward occupation. The French had to follow all rules of the Germans, who themselves enjoyed all the best France had to offer. The people of France witnessed how their occupiers ruined their beloved country. At this time, foreign media publication also started to make their mark and call the French to unite against the Germans and against their own government. The hatred toward the Germans reached it's peak in the summer of 1942 when it was realized that collaboration with the occupiers might erase what was left of their friends. At that time, collaboration was equal to betrayal and the enforced cohabitation became impossible. Sharing French cafes, clubs, and bars with the aggressor became an example for how much the Germans could destroy not only the French culture, but also what used to be the French spirit. >> So as we can see, the general scene of French society was complicated. This affected the French Jews too. Out of the 350,000 Jews of France, many lived in the country for decades and even centuries. Yet, more than half of the Jewish population had come from anti-Semitic Eastern European countries, from North Africa, or as refugees from Nazi Germany. All adored the values and traditions of French liberalism and culture. France was for them, the bastion of progress. One could say that even the non-citizens among the Jews were French patriots. Some of the Jews in France were so assimilated that they had a hardly knowledge about Judaism. Their identify was French par excellence. For those people, it was not only the loss of France, but also the fact that Marshal Petain, the French World War 1 hero, joined forces with the Germans and became head of a collaborationist state was a tragedy. On July 15th, 1940 Raymond-Raoul Lambert, one of the leaders of the French Jewry, wrote in his diary, French Jewry is enduring a particular kind of anguish. It accepts suffering along with everyone else, but dreads the discrimination the enemy may demand. This fear makes me particularly dread the future for myself and for my sons, but I still have confidence. France cannot accept just anything, and it is not for nothing that the bones of my family have mingled with it's soil for more than a century, and that I have served two wars. For my wife, my sons, and myself, I cannot imagine life in another climate; pulling up those roots would be worse than an amputation. Yet things did get worse, on October 18th of 1940, the Vichy, France declared the Statute of Jews, Statut des Juif, which was implemented throughout the divided country. A truly French initiative, similar to the Nuremberg laws, this decreed defined Judaism by race, and paved the road to the removal of the Jews from most public and professional spheres. Attached is Lambert reaction, written on October 19th, 1940. Racism has become the law of the new state. What boundless disgrace! I cannot yet take in the denial of justice and the scientific truth. All my illusions are crumbling around me. I am afraid, not only for myself, but for my country. This cannot last, it's impossible. Yesterday evening I wept like a man who is suddenly abandoned by his wife who has been the one love of his life, the one guiding light of his thinking, the one leader whom he has followed in his actions. You can read other segments of his diary below. The anti-Jewish measures decided by French leaders and supported by many of the French, at this point the goal had a little support, and the resistance was in it's infancy, were a painful slap in the face of French Jewry. Albert Memmi, the famous Jewish intellectual born in Tunis but brought up on French culture, wrote in his Pillar of Salt, this was a painful surprising betrayal by a culture on which I had pinned all my hopes, to which I had devoted all of my admiration, my heartfelt ardor. A betrayal I may have partly been anticipating, but here it has been confirmed with such brutality. All of Europe has turned into a monster. So what was France during the war? A betrayal of civil and human spirit, an opportunity for a new and exciting national identity, or a city of lights occupied by the dark forces? Actually, it was all three. Understanding this triangle of different perspective in a given place is essential in Holocaust studies. It is not only the German policy that saved Jewish life, but also the complex reaction of local population influenced by the discriminating Nazi occupation, and by it's own tendencies which derived from local traditions and expectations. Thus, it is not only the question of occupation patterns, military rule versus puppet states, or of the leading forces within Nazi Germany, SS civil administration. It is no less important to understand how the German forces were accepted and interpreted by the local population as hated occupiers or as a new and promising world power, offering opportunity of becoming part of it? Comprehending the varying attitudes of different groups in the local population enabled better understanding of the collapsing Jewish world during the Holocaust. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-1/lecture/4FCCe/focus-on-poland","Focus on Poland","[MUSIC] Hello, let's return now to the various German occupation patterns in Europe and try to understand their impact on the development of anti-Jewish policies. First, we'll focus on some events which took place in occupied Poland in 1939, 1940 and then turn to some notions shaped in occupied France. Each of those cases will help us understand some important aspects and notions which are essential for understanding of the Holocaust. Attacked by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in September 1939, Poland didn't really have any chance, and it collapsed after a month of brave, yet hopeless battle. It's eastern parts were occupied by Soviet Union. Yet, I wish to focus here on the parts of occupied Poland, which fell into the hands of Nazi Germany from the very beginning of the war. In those territories, lived about 22 million Polish citizens, among them, more than 2 million Jews. Ten million non-Jewish Poles, and 600,000 Polish Jews, of them in the western parts, which as we said, was annexed to the greater German Reich for ideological and economic reasons. Oops, incorporating millions of non orient Poles and hundreds of thousands of Jews into the third Reich? Those new Jews numbered more than the original size of the Jewish community in Germany and millions of Slavic people were never meant to be part of the Reich. This was, of course, an incomprehensible thought from the Nazi racial point of view. Thus, this area became an experimental zone for German authorities but especially, for the SS. They wish to cleanse it from the Jews and radically reduce the number of Poles, while using those territories for the resettlement of Volksdeutsche, ethnic Germans from Poland and other Eastern European countries. Why the SS? Among other influential positions, Heinrich Himmler who headed the SS, which at this moment included already the entire German police apparatus., was appointed in 1939 as the Reich Commissar for the strengthening Germandom. This was a newly invented, extremely important ideological position and task. The SS, established in 1925, as a small personal honor guard for Hitler became until the end of the war, a powerful organization numbering more than half a million people. Gaining control of the police system, it was transformed into a disciplined ideological organization devoted to Hitler and to fulfilling his goals. SS men, the Blackshirts, were recruited and trained as ideological soldiers totally loyal to Hitler and the Nazi worldview. Look at the slogan on their belt. Unlike the SA, the Brownshirts, this was an elite unit that excepted only pure racial Aryans. Candidates for the SS were asked to answer many questions regarding their appearance, height, hair color, and the changing color of their skin after sunburn and their medical history. Were there any suicide cases in the family? They were also expected to answer the question of church affiliation, not with Catholic or Protestant but stating they believe in the almighty. Now in Poland, the SS had its terrifying plans revealed in a memorandum written in May 1940 by Himmler, Some Thoughts on the Treatment of the Alien Populations in the East. Who were those alien populations in the east? Poles, Jews, Ukrainians, Belorussians and so on. People who lived in those areas for centuries were considered alien due to the Nazi racist ideology. In this document, Himmler presented a racial screening process for the best and brightest of the Slavic children, which would enable Nazi Germany to fish out the racially valuable people. From this mishmash, take them to Germany and assimilate them there. The remaining population deserved nothing from Himmler's point of view. The non German population of the eastern territories must not receive any education higher than that of an elementary school with four forms. The objective of this elementary school must simply be to teach simple arithmetic up to 500 at the most, how to write one's name and to teach them that it's God's commandment to be obedient to the Germans and to be honest, hard working and well behaved. Himmler wished to condemn east European nations to slavery and ignorance so they won't be able endanger their oppressors. Thus, the Polish population in the territories annexed to the Greater Reich were subjected to extreme discrimination in their own homeland. Deprived of any civil rights, prohibited to preserve any aspect of their nationality, they became second class citizens on their native soil. Even worse, hundreds of thousands of Poles were expelled and deported from the annexed territories to the General Government in the very first month of occupation as a part of a large and cruel ethnic cleansing. Later on, millions of Poles from all over the occupied countries were taken to forced labor and Poland's intellectual elite, as well as clergy, political activists were imprisoned and murdered. All those steps stem from the place, or more precisely the lack of place, Nazi Germany designed for Poles in the new order and the SS, which prided itself as a guardian of the Aryan purity was a main force behind them. At the same time, beginning in mid-October, 1939, alongside the hundreds of thousands of Poles who were deported, yet in even harsher conditions, almost 100,000 Jews were expelled from the annexed territories to the General Government. Parallel to that, the SS executed the Nisko Plan, an attempt to deport all Jews from Austria and the Protectorate to the Jewish reservation in the Lublin area. Yet, in the mid 1940, this plan was put on hold and cancelled due to practical problems within the SS, as well as the resistance of the General Government governor, Hans Frank. Hans Frank was one of the first members of the Nazi party, and a devoted Nazi himself. As a governor of the General Government, he sought to exploit his Polish territories in any sense he could. He oversaw the looting of the art treasures and the utilizing of natural sources and imposed draconic forced labor on it's citizens. Yet, at the same time, he was furious when SS men allowed themselves to act independently in the territories under his responsibility. This was a conflict which mixed personal and organizational tensions. You see, within the Nazi regime, there were several competing powers. Actually, the SS was only one of them and it surely had its opponents, not only Frank and his evil administration. In those years, the Wehrmacht, the German Army who had its own military interest in the General Government abhorred the SS. Some of it's commanders were worried about the worthless cruelty, with the SS imposed on the occupied country and it's affect on the army and on Germany. As an example, on February 6th, 1940, the Wehrmacht Colonel General Blaskowitz wrote among other things, the acts of violence against the Jews which occur in full view of the public inspire among the religious Poles not only deep disgust but also great pity for the Jewish population. A statement we'll have to refer to later on but, thus it continues, the worst damage will accrue to the German nation from the present situation is the brutalization and moral debasement which in a very short time, will spread like a plague among valuable German manpower. The attitude of the troops to the SS and police alternates between abhorrence and hatred. Every soldier feels repelled and revolted by those crimes which are being perpetrated in Poland by nationals of the Reich and representatives of the State authority. How are conflicts of interest and personal tensions resolved in the Third Reich? Actually, often there weren't. Why? Because they served the system and above all, they fed the ambiguity with which Hitler led his people. Ian Kershaw used in his highly recommended biography of Hitler, a term which gives a fine insight into the mode of action in the Nazi state, Working toward the Fuehrer. Working towards the Fuehrer meant that Hitler had set general goals and policy guidelines, and expected his people to suggest ways to accomplish them. The finest reward, borrowing a Nazi civil servant's words, would go to those who succeeded in fulfilling the Fuehrer's goal by Hitler's own approval. Hitler created, in Nazi Germany, an array of competing forces who wished to win his approval. Only rarely, did they interfere, raising or praising this organization or another, while constantly invoking their internal competition. This was also true regarding his most senior subordinates such as Goering, Himmler, Goebbels and others. This concept of working toward the Fuehrer had a devastating effect on anti-Jewish policy and as we will see, contributed considerably to it's constantly escalating nature. In this specific arena of internal tensions of 1939, 1940, regarding Jewish faith in occupied Poland, Hans Frank won. The mass deportation to the General Government organized by the SS stopped and the Nisko Plan was canceled only to give way to more radical programs. The Wermacht objection did not have any practical effect. At this stage, when the battles over Poland had ended, it's part was not central. The German army will return to be an important player in this scene only toward the attack on Soviet Russia in the middle of 1941. By then, many things will change in it, including it's criticism of the SS methods. And what about the SS? Unfortunately, they will return, in full force, to occupied Poland, and will take the lead in later years, spreading death and misery to millions of Poles, and condemning Polish Jews to total annihilation.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-1/lecture/XDNUm/from-the-historians-desk-visual-documentation","From the Historian's Desk - Visual Documentation","[MUSIC] >> We have seen that within a few years Nazi Germany occupied or controlled most of Europe and tried to shape the whole continent according to Nazi racist ideology. This is, of course, very interesting. Yet, why should we, in a course which deals with the holocaust, the destruction of the Jewish people during the second world war, concern ourselves with all those different types of occupation? Well, we should state clearly, Jewish life was inherently connected to its surroundings. One cannot understand the complexity of the holocaust and the varying Jewish experiences in it while neglecting the wider historical context. Nazi genocidal ideology demanded the total removal of the Jews. Yet, the maners in which the Jews were removed from the public sphere throughout Europe before they were murdered varied greatly depending on local factors. For the Nazis, western and eastern European Jews symbolized different aspects of the Jewish danger. The Western Jews, not always easily identified as a Jew, was seen as carrying within him all the destructive Jewish traits. And the authentic traditional Jewish Eastern one was perhaps a scary as intimidating as has been emphasized in Nazi propaganda for years. For Nazi Germany, it didn't matter who this or that specific Jew was, where they lived, how they dressed or how old they were. Their very Jewishness was enough to deny them all human rights. Yet, the anti-Jewish policies could not always be easily implemented, especially in western countries where the local public opinion was taken into some account. The Germans could shoot Jews in the streets of any city in Poland or Lithuania without the need to take into consideration the local response. But this would not be done in Paris, Amsterdam or Antwerp. For Nazi Germany, the public's prefer of west European societies could not be stained publicly with Jewish blood. This deferentiality shaped not only Jewish life, but also the very different Jewish understandings regarding the nature of. But for now, it is sufficient to stress that even in times of extreme segregation of the Jews from their surroundings, their life was very much influenced by the occupation pattern implemented in their various homelands. Before demonstrating this by focusing on two specific realities, occupied Poland on the one hand, and Paris under Nazi rule on the other, let's have an important discussion from the historian's desk. In this course in general, and in the last unit in particular, we have used many visual documents. Photographs, short films, and as well as artwork created by Jews or non-Jews. We use those historical documents in order to help you deepen and better understand a specific aspect of some of our topics. What are those visual sources, and who made them? Some of them are personal documents, pictures and film are taken by people, mainly German soldiers, while advancing throughout Europe. Others are official documents, mainly film by the German Propaganda Campaign of the army. The German army had special units which were supposed to provide raw materials for the well oiled Nazi propaganda machine under the direction of Joseph Goebbels. For example, on October 2, 1939, a month after the invasion of Poland, the Reich Ministry of Propaganda gave the Vermacht Propaganda Division the following guidelines. Send film of Jewish types from Warsaw and throughout all of occupied Poland, both character studies and pictures of Jews at forced labor. This material is intended to strengthen our antisemitic propaganda campaign at home and abroad. Still, photos and movies were filmed and gathered in order to demonstrate to the German people the victories of the Germany's military and the triumph of its ideology. Proper segments were chosen and shown in the cinema in the Die Deutsche Wochenschau, the German weekly news reels. In times of no TV and Internet, this was a useful tool to pass information, or more precisely, a very specific part of the information that which was suitable to the regime's ideology and emphasized it. Let's watch, for example, a minute of the Wochenschau number 567 from July, 1941, describing the occupation of Riga as part of operation Barbarossa mentioned a few minutes ago. [MUSIC] >> [FOREIGN] [MUSIC] >> [FOREIGN] [MUSIC] >> [FOREIGN] [MUSIC] >> [FOREIGN] >> [FOREIGN] >> What can we learn from this segment? One might think, understandably, I must admit, that this is just an expected part of Nazi propaganda. With occupation of the victorious Germans forcibly taught the lazy Jews the true meaning of physical work. Unfortunately, this is not even close to the horror those pictures revealed. Who for years headed the Photo Archives, managed to identify those Jews in the pictures. Apparently, they were not photographed in Riga, Latvia, but in Shavli, Lithuania. They were not part of a sadistic re-education. But what we see here are the last minutes in the lives of some prominent Jews from Shavli arrested on the 28th of June, 1941. They come on the next day to a near forest, forced to dig their graves, and shot to death. How do we know that? Because some pictures of the murdered Jews were recognized by Shavli Jews long before this film resurfaced. This is Elizer Ilya Pen. And here is Rabbi Yitzkhak Nakhumovski and Rabbi Yitzkhak Rabinovitz minutes before they were shot to death. We will discuss those terrible act of mass murders in shooting pits which were part of their effort to annihilate European Jews in the second half of this course. Yet, for now, I want us to limit ourself and ask what can we learn from those pictures. Do they lie? Or is it only our misguided understanding? Is a picture or a film really worth a thousand words? Yes, and no. Photographs and films are just another historical document we should use carefully and critically. Like any other source, we should place them in the wide historical context and ask ourself who took them, when and why, what do they show us, and what do they conceal. As we have just seen, and we will see this in the future, since most of the visual documentation during the Holocaust was created by German forces, many times the most important part of the story is the one we don't see. The one that is concealed. Maybe even more misleading are the cases in which the German images show us the whole picture, but a picture colored in dangerous antisemitic ideological colors. >> Photography, both official and private, was the central media in Nazi Germany. After it came to power, the Nazi party and the Nazi state used photography as a central element in it's media and in it's propaganda. Private photography also prospered as more cameras were produced and as more people purchased them. When World War II broke out, the use of cameras intensified. Military events and the newly occupied territories provided official and private photographers many interesting objects for photography. Among them, were ethnic groups defined as hostile by Nazi propaganda. Photos of Jews, Slavs, and black-French soldiers became quite widespread. Where there are a couple of examples for this kind of photography. Here we have an album that includes photos that were taken in one of the Polish ghettos during 1940 which depicts not only typical what the Germans defined as types, Jewish types inside the ghetto. But also used the acceptable way of presenting ethnical groups, ethnical members of ethnical groups, in the Nazi propaganda. Putting the person in the middle of the street, posing him, and trying to take advantage of this angle in order to capture his ethnical features, his facial and bodily ethnical features. Another example that I have here is a sort of an album created by a German soldier during 1940 during the battle of France. What we see here, and this is quite interesting, is not only photos that depict the battlefields, military equipment, German soldiers and so on, but also photos depicting POWs. French POWs are not simple POWs, but black POWs. Members of those colonial troops serving within the French army. The influence of Nazi ideology on photography came into play not only in the choice of subjects, but also in the composition of the photos, as we just saw. The visual influence of ideology was enhanced, in many cases, by the texts inscribed on the other side of the photos or next to them. Cynical remarks, like Jewish mob, and this is how the chosen people looks like, were added to both private and official photos reflecting Nazi anti-Semitic vocabulary. >> Unfortunately, most of the photographs we have showing the Jews during the Holocaust are Nazi German icons with all that is implied. A reflection of an anti-Semitic vision of the Jews. Nazi racist ideology not only guided the German official documentation, but also penetrated the personal ones. Thus, one of our greatest challenges in this course in documentary films in exhibitions on the Holocaust, and so on, is to show victims of the Nazis as human beings while one of our main tools, the visuals, include many anti-Semitic stereotypes which dehumanize them. Many times we don't have alternative sources. But we must be aware of these implanted biases. In our next meeting, when we'll try to understand the internal life of Jews during the Holocaust, we'll present some unique collection of photographs taken by Jews during the war which, again, like any other historical document, will have the specific biases that we should consider. But what I want us to remember from this short exercise is how careful we must be, not only with written documents, but also with visual ones which could, and many time are, very misleading.

In our last lesson we discussed Nazi ideology and analyzed the collapse of German democracy, which allowed the rise of Nazi German. Today, I want us to broaden our perspective beyond Germany, and better understand German occupation patterns throughout Europe. As we will see, presenting the fate of European citizens under the influence of Hitler is critical for understanding the life and death of Jews in those places. Why did Nazi Germany repeatedly attack it's neighbors? One of the things we must remember is that Nazi ideology did not limit itself to the Jews and to the aspiration of their disappearance and annihilation. It also wanted to shape the whole world according to its racial ideology and create a New Order in Europe and beyond. Jews were considered an anti race, a destructive, undermining, and polluting element. A hazard to humanity. Other people, and nations were categorized, rated, and ranked according to a racial hierarchy. In the Nazi world view, Arians were considered the master race, consisting above all of the Germans and ethnic Germans in Eastern Europe, but also northwestern populations such as the Dutch and the Scandinavians. People belonging to this group were not only viewed by the Nazis as superior, but also as those who needed and deserved more. More rights, more food, more space: lebensraum, living space. From whom and where could this lebensraum be taken? From those who Nazi Germany saw as subhuman, as untermenschen. Those were the nations and people who replaced by Nazi racist ideology at the bottom of the racial scale. Slavic nations such as the Russians and Poles, as well as others. Generally speaking, Western countries where seen as present or a potential future allies of native Germany. The existence of Eastern European nations was to be tolerated by the Nazis, only if they served the superior race. But if so, why did Nazi Germany support Ukrainian nationality, an Eastern Europe nation, and divide France, a western country by all accounts? Well, generally speaking is only really accurate in history. We can portray the large picture by major trends, but if we want to understand a given historical reality, we will need much more. We'll need to take into consideration not only ideology, but also practical and local interest in factors. Keeping this in mind, let us turn to a brief description of some of the rapid and radical changes which swept Europe during the second world war. We have seen already how Germany continually expanded the Third Reich. Hitler, who learned that his previous valulation of international agreements were tolerated as part of the world's appeasement policy, made Poland his next target. Hitler demanded to annex the area around the German speaking free city of Danzig, called the Polish Corridor, in order to have a territorial connection from Germany to the city and East Prussia, also a German enclave. Poland, of course, refused. In view of Nazi Germany's continuing degradation, England and France gave Poland international guarantees to keep its territory intact, yet in world politics, promises are often wanting, action are another. On September the first, 1931, Nazi Germany attacked Poland in what became the outbreak of World War II. German troops invaded the country from three directions launching the Blitzkrieg, the lightning war. A military doctrine designed to bring a quick conclusion of the battle. As part of the blitzkrieg, not only rapid movements of military aerial and ground forces are used, this method deliberately targeted civilian population centers in order to raise difficulty for the tact army to organize an effective counter offensive. Two days later, on the third of September, 1939, England and France declared war on Germany as promised. This part of Timise into Poland and pulled hope to hold on until help would arrive. Yet this declaration was never followed by action, thus this stage was named the phony war and it lasted until western Europe was attacked. Meanwhile, in Poland, things got worse. On September 17, 1939, Soviet Russia also invaded Poland and occupied its eastern parts. This was a result of a secret nonaggression agreement signed with Germany on August 23, 1939, The Liebentraub Molotov Pact. Poland as a political entity ceased to exist, and was divided into three parts. It's Eastern part under Soviet Russia, It's Western parts annexed to greater Germany, the Third Reich, and in what remained, Nazi Germany established the General Gouverment, a separate German administration. In the Nazi racial worldview, Polish people were not entitled to a country, and Poland had no place in the European new order. Western European countries carefully watched the brutal steps which were taken in occupied Poland. Polish Jews and Polish Christians were both victims of the ruthless Nazi occupation, though they were unequal victims, to use a term phrased by the scholars Israel Gutman and Shmoleka Kofsky. But the main interest of the Western European countries was not the fair of fellow citizens, Jewish or non Jewish. They were mainly busy defending what they saw as their immediate interest intrenchment of the marginal line on the German French border and protecting the natural resources in the Northern part of the continent. Yet, Hitler had his own interest in those areas, economic and ideological, and he planned an integrated attack. On April 9th, 1940, Nazi forces occupied Denmark, and invaded Norway. In order to protect Germany's trade routes with independent Sweden and guarantee supply of iron. A month later, on the 10th of May, Netherland, Belgium, and Luxemburg where invaded. Occupied in days, the road to France was opened. On the 22nd of June, Marshal Henri-Philippe Ptain, one of France's national heroes from World War I, and now the prime minister, signed a humiliating surrender agreement and defeated France was divided into two. It's northern and western parts consisting of about 60% of the country were under direct Nazi rule, while in the rest, Vichy France was established, and this included French colonies in North Africa. In each one of the newly occupied countries, Nazi Germany created a different form of regime. France was divided. In the Netherlands, a civil German occupation administration was established. Operating alongside the local administration, because a German perceived the Dutch as belonging to the Greater German tribes. In Belgium and Northern France, a military rule. In Denmark, a strange combination of leaving the Danish democratic government in place along side moderate German oversight. How can this mixture be explained? A: the countries and areas that became Hitler's new frontiers were all under a direct Nazi rule. Meaning, it was not only ideology which shaped Hitler's occupation patrons, but also local military and other interests. B: because of the racial hierarchy, unlike Poland, none of the Western countries was completely dissolved and their citizens could keep at least some notion of their original nationality. More important, none of those occupation regimes was as cruel as in the east. Being a citizen in the eastern parts of Europe or in it's western areas were two different stories. Along those occupation, and they skip many other fighting arenas in order to concentrate for now on Hitler's furies of influence, Nazi Germany extended its influence in other means. In September of 1940, the Axis powers Germany and Italy and Japan extended their military pact. In November 1940, Hungary and Romania joined in and in March 1941, Bulgaria did so too. Each of those countries was later rewarded by Hitler with territorial benefits for its support. In April 1941, Nazi Germany came to Mussolini's aid when he encountered difficulties occupying Greece, and Yugoslavia as a punishment for canceling previous agreements with Nazi Germany, was dissolved and divided. On the 22nd of June 1941, Nato Germany attacked it's former ally Soviet Russia in operation La Bolza. Within weeks, the German forces whipped across the eastern parts of Europe, spreading death and destruction in their wake. The Nazis saw Soviet Russia is both inhibited by untermenschen and is a birthplace of communism. Communism, which was perceived as we said in our last lesson as a dangerous Jewish influence. Thus, the talk on the Soviet Union was a turning point in the world. A fundamental, ideological, total war being therefor, accompanied by horrible brutality. The great difference between Nazi occupations in the east and west couldn't be more apparent. Thus, between 1933 and 1942, Europe entirely changed its face. Some countries were erased from the map, other had their borders redrawn, and many different patterns of occupation filled Europe. Yet, although hundreds of millions of European citizens were under Nazi influence, their lives differed dramatically. Moreover, whereas Nazi impact on non-Jewish society was sometimes moderate and sometimes devastating, for the Jewish citizens of Europe, it was always profoundly destructive. [MUSIC]",""

We learned how Nazi German racist ideology tried to shape the whole world, as well as the central place the Jews and Judaism had in it. A most dangerous element which was responsible for world wide ideas of humanity and Universalism. And thus must be removed. The frightened process of the collapse of the German democracy and its shocking impact on Jews and non-Jews. And the necessary wider background of European Jewry prior to the war and of the many different conducts and contexts of the Second World War. We have analyzed a few important aspects of Jewish life under Nazi occupation. In Eastern Europe, or in the West of the continent. Moreover, we try to expose you to some of the methodological aspects of the work of the historian, such as visual documentation or the importance of Jewish sources. I do hope that we not only provided some preliminary and partial answers but also raised some new questions. Regarding the complicated reality of the holocaust, and it rose curiosity about its conduct. If so, you are more than welcome to learn more by reading the many publications in the field. And our recommended list is only a small fragment of it. It actually, until now, we haven't reached the deepest of beasts of the Holocaust. We haven't spoken about the many different decisions, involving high-ranking Nazis as well as grassroots, which brought the murder of 6 million Jews. As well as the Jews' experience in the face of total death of so many different worlds. Join us in the second part of this course, in which we will delve into the dark depths of the practical planning and implementation of the mass murder of the Jews.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-1/lecture/VPHPZ/future-expectations-and-rumors","Future Expectations and Rumors","[MUSIC] During this course we're constantly moving back and forth between the overall picture and specific illustrations. So what can we say about Jewish internal life under Nazi rule? Was it a continuity of former life, or totally new reality? Did it strengthen Jewish solidarity or weaken it? As in many other cases in history, the answer is both. Though in some aspects one can trace phenomena and trends which were a part of the Jewish life before the war, in other aspects the Holocaust created or evoked new social and personal structures which in the past had very small place in the Jewish society. Yet, as we already partially heard in the Warsaw Ghetto case, the most critical voices regarding the changes which occurred in the Jewish society came from its own members. In numerous wartime Jewish accounts, we can find the mental questions regarding what will be the impact of those terrible days on the development of or in the future of the Jewish society. Some challenged decisions made by Jewish figures such as Rabbis or other living figures. Others wondered what will be the long term of effect of world distress on the Jewish cohesion or atomization. Despite the segregation of the Jews, many questioned the impact of the Holocaust, not only on the Jewish society, but also the reaction of the surroundings. Silvia Lombroso from Italy, who wrote in her diary, and the curious thing is the reaction, or the lack of reaction which I have noticed in the intelligent and even good people. In practice, they force themselves day by day, to become a little more indifferent to the suffering of others; and even if left with qualms, they will silence them. If some scruple remains with them, they silence it and console themselves by saying that, after all, there must be a reason for all this racist and anti-Jewish journey, something mysterious which no one has ever discovered. Yes, there must be, if only to allow these good people, to sleep their own quiet sleep. While some Jews condemned the world for the lack of reaction to the Jewish plight, other were clinging to it expressing a feeling that from this terrible situation. A better world must arise, claiming that their suffering could not be in vain. And that with the defeat of the evil racist wins a better and more liberal world must emerge. As an example, the teacher of Avraham Levin wrote in the following in June, 1942 in the Warsaw Ghetto. In spite of all of shattering experience and bitter disappointments, I still believe in the human being, and even in the German human being. A new humanity will rise, to which the German people will also belong. A few weeks later, his beloved wife, Luba, was one of the 300,000 Jews sent to the Nazi death camp, Treblinka, and six months later he, and his only daughter, 15 years old Ola, would follow her. No better world was awaiting most Jews, only a much worse genocidal one. Reading those many Jewish accounts and of course what was brought to you here is the tip of the iceberg. We still must return to some of the questions we raised in the beginning of our meeting today. What really is the value of Jewish wartime accounts or later documents and how does it contribute to our understanding of the Holocaust? By now, I hope you understand that many aspects of daily Jewish life would have been an enigma, if not for Jewish writings, through exposing historical reality demands numerous German sources, decrease internal protocols, visuals and more and the local prospect TVs also essential for understanding the general context. Yet, in the absence of Jewish writing, the essence of the Holocaust would be lost. This might sound odd to you today, yet in the first years after the war, many researchers dealing with the Holocaust didn't really use Jewish communication. Even some prominent researchers of the Holocaust rejected using Jewish testimonies or at least were very suspicious of their context. This tendency had many results. Among them, were that much of the research in the field dealt with the German and their bureaucracy while the Jewish perspective was somehow put aside. As well as the neglect of many important issues. Yet one of its most problematic invariable outcomes was that it condemned Jews to be seen as passive victims. If you don't ask yourself what and if were the Jewish reactions, you might not even be aware of their existence. Today the situation in Holocaust research is completely different, and all researchers understand the necessity of using all the communications available. Jewish, German, or local. So are Jewish testimonies always accurate? Is any other testimony, not always? Yet, placing a given testimony in historical context, usually enable us to extract from it, it's reliable parts. And what about wartime writings by Jews, who are not aware of the wider context? Well actually, often the strength of those contemporary documents is exactly this. They know nothing but their own understandings, shaped by rumors, fears and hopes, which is exactly what sometimes we wish to expose and analyze. And here it must be stressed that the very fact so many Jews wrote during the war should not be taken for granted. The collective Jewish past had a central part in Jewish identity even before the emergence of modern Jewish historiography. Simon Dubnow, born in Belarus in 1860, was one of the leading Jewish historians of his time, who had peeled the Jewish intelligentsia in 1891 to collect, Yiddish and preserve Jewish documents as a national mission. His magnum opus, World History of the Jewish People, was published in ten volumes in Berlin, to which he moved due to the many limitations imposed on Russian Jews. With Hitler's rise to power in 1933 he left to Riga, Latvia and he continued to write and act until the Nazi occupation in July, 1941. Some say he repeatedly demanded the inhabitants of the Riga Ghetto, Yidn, Shraybt un farshraybt, Jews, write and record. On November the 8th, 1941, at the age of 81, this great Jewish scholar was taken, with thousands of Jews, to the nearby Rumbula forest, where 24,000 Riga Jews were murdered. Due to his age he was spared the horror of the shooting pits like other old people, he was shot along the way. Yet his appeal echoed long after his death. The Oneg Shabbat Archive is very much connected to his tradition, as you can read in Samuel Kassow important book, Who Will Write our History? More modest documentation project existed in Biaystok, Vilna, and France. And numerous Jews from all segments of society and throughout Europe wrote during the war about their experience. Yet only part of those accounts survived. Many more were lost with the deportation and murder of the writers. True, not all Jews who are capable of writing and not all realities enabled it. As a well known writer and Auschwitz survivor Primo Levi wrote, at a distance of years one can today definitely affirm that the history of the Lagers, Nazi Camps, has been written almost exclusively by those who, like myself, never fathomed them to the bottom. Those who did so did not return, or their capacity for observation was paralyzed by suffering and incomprehension. Thus, even the most terrifying accounts don't reveal the true essence of horror. Not all could describe and not all could be described. This is an important limitation of human language and thought we must remember. A partial list of personal accounts available in English is attached below for those of you who are interested in hearing more of those unique voices. The fact that still so many Jews tried to write and document even in the most severe conditions, not only enable us to understand the Holocaust better, but also should be seen as a unique Jewish response which existed parallel to many others to which we still need to refer.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-1/lecture/zhY1f/leadership","Leadership","[MUSIC] Welcome back. As one can see, diving into chosen realities shaped in specific countries or cities can expose many different aspects of Jewish life during the Holocaust. In our last lesson, we talked about Poland and France, today, mainly about Warsaw but also about the Netherlands, and other locations. Yet, historical monographs, comprehensive studies of a given place, provide only an incomplete part of history, and must go along with wider research. Comparative research of a specific aspect, daily life or attempts of rescue and resistance, has emerged in various places. By comparing different human interactions, we can not only shed light on unique feature of each one of the events inspected but also try to formulate some general human insights. Let's demonstrate the importance of comparative studies by analyzing one major phenomenon, Jewish leadership, and its different characters facing ghettos, and segregation. The very different manner of segregation of Jews in eastern Europe ghettos, and its western part, legal separation, demanded independent discussion of each of those realities. Only towards the end, will we try and shape some more general insights. Dealing with Jewish leadership in the ghettos, we must return to Heydrich's Schnellbrief. As we saw, it ordered the concentration of the Jews but not in the manner which it will be done. What it didn't detail was the establishment of local Jewish authorities, mainly Judenrats. In each Jewish community, a Council of Jewish Elders is to be set up which, as far as possible, is to be composed of the remaining authoritative personalities and rabbis. The Council is to be made fully responsible, in the literal sense of the word, for the exact and prompt implementation of directives already issued or to be issued in the future. The Judenrats were ordered to organize all aspects of Jewish life, some which never before were a part of the community responsibility. Such as maintaining public order or collecting garbage, as well filling endless quotas of the forced labor. Due to the poor situation of most Jews in the ghettos, many Judenrats were engaged in welfare activities and tried to maintain a reasonable level of sanitation in the ghetto. However, lack of resources rendered most efforts futile. Thus the Judenrats were ordered to lead communities, which German regulation denied any real possibility of functioning and were trapped between the never ending German orders, and their inability to fulfill them. Moreover, the Judenrats were also caught between the expectation of their Jewish community to act as a leadership, meaning to promise or at least protect Jewish interests. And a powerful regime which not only wasn't concerned with the welfare of the Jews but also constantly acted to harm them. To make things even more complicated, many Jewish in the east lacked their prewar leaders. Some managed to flee, whether in the beginning of the war, or later on, others were killed in the first deadly days of the occupation. Adam Czerniakow, who headed the Judenrat in Warsaw, or Haim Rumkowski from Lodz, as an example, were not the leading figures of their communities before the war. And still found themselves facing the impossible human task, heading Jewish communities whose very existence were threatened. The Lodz Ghetto, sealed on the first of May 1940, numbered 164,000 Jews, the largest ghetto at the time and was located in one of the most poorest neighborhood of the city. Unemployment and hunger rose quickly and threatened to cause a complete collapse of the Jewish society and cost many lives. To avoid this, Romkowski led a productivization of the Ghetto and established about 120 factories in the Ghetto in which many of its inhabitants were employed. For Rumkowski, it was the only way to prevent worsening the distress, while for the German local authorities, it became a source of profit. The Lodz Ghetto, which serves as an extreme example of an isolated ghetto within its borders, Jews even had to use special Jewish money, preventing them from having any economic connections with their surroundings was governed with an iron fist by Rumkowski. Labor unions, which were very strong in the Jewish Lodz before the war, remember the as an example, were crushed by Rumkowski, as was any other attempt to question his leadership. Yet even the massive Jewish enslavement in the Lodz Ghetto did not prevent the stress, and 43,000 of its inhabitants died from hunger and disease. Internal Jewish joke said that in the Lodz Ghetto, Jews died equally. In Warsaw, on the other hand, the Judenrat was blamed for deepening social gaps. As an example, taxes were imposed equally and not in a progressive manner, meaning even the poorest Jews were required to pay the same sum as wealthier ones. In some ghettos, Jewish inhabitants felt that the Judenrat has done all it could to ease the stress. In many others, it was blamed for not succeeding to do so, or even of corruption, which enabled bearable lives for some Jews while condemning the others to boundless anguish. Jewish communities in western and central Europe were in a somewhat different situation. First, since Jews were not concentrated in ghettos, their physical existence was not in constant danger and the responsibility for all aspect of Jewish life was not imposed on the shoulders of its leaders. Secondly, Nazi Germany didn't demand establishing of local Jewish leadership in it's cities or towns but tried to set up a countrywide Jewish structure. Reichsvereinigung der Juden in Deutschland, Reich's Association of the Jews in Germany, Association of Jews in Belgium, and the UJIF, General Union of Jews in France. Slovakia and Romania also formed central Jewish leaderships. You see Nazi Germany rapidly gaining control in those countries as well as its refraining from atrocities. Most times, former Jewish leaders generally remained in place. This had its advantage, it also had its price, as in an example in the Netherlands. >> When we are speaking about continuity between the Preoccupation and Occupation period, there are many continuities but there are also slight changes and we have to be aware of it. Now in Holland, the couple, Asscher and Cohen, who chaired the Jewish council, are a very interesting case. Asscher was a diamond industrial, very wealthy. He was also a politician in the general politics of the country. He was a liberal. He was a member of the Parliament of the north Holland province. He was also chairman of the Jewish community in Amsterdam and chairman of the roof organization of all Ashkenazi Jews in the Netherlands. The other person, David Cohen, he was a history professor at Amsterdam University. He dealt with antiquity and he was also a Zionist since childhood. He had worked for refugees already,at the beginning of the 20th century, as a student. Now in 1933, those two Asscher and Cohen established a committee for special Jews, at first, that was days after Hitler came into power in Germany. A part of this committee for special Jewish affairs was the refugee committee. Now this committee which dealt with urgent, contemporary issues of problems of Jews in the world in Germany and in the Netherlands was therefore much more representative than the established Jewish community. Although, as I said, Asscher was part of the established community but the refugee committee had to deal with the Dutch authorities on a daily basis. The committee for Jewish affairs dealt with Germany, with Jewish communities in other countries. They were much more into the current affairs than the Jewish communities as such, and therefore, when we find them immediately after the occupation, being in the Jewish Council, which was established by the Nazis, this is a continuity which is important to emphasize. What we can see and that is very interesting, that already before the occupation in a very interesting document from March 1939, the Nazi's themselves, the security service of the SS points to these people and some others. That they are the important people who should be chosen afterwards when the Netherlands will be occupied by Germany. >> Another result of the continuity of leadership or the great impact of former personal tensions as well as of the general worldview of the leaders. For example, in occupied France, Jewish leaders in the [INAUDIBLE] were divided whether they were now also responsible for the foreign Jews. Moreover, as devotees of law abiding tradition, they were hesitant regarding illegal activity even though they recognized that the authoriteis were hostile to them. Lambert, who we mentioned in our last meeting rejected the legitimacy of the new discriminating laws and claimed that by harming non-citizen Jewish in France, the country denies its historical tradition. Yet other leaders, mainly those of the historical central of France established by Napoleon in 1808 saw things differently. This was a result of changing generation as well as different worldviews. One way or another, the burden was heavy. In December 1941, Lambert wrote, can we accept being the executors of those in power? Can we refuse, with all personal consequences this may have for us? This is a moral dilemma for us. Yet, were those people appointed by the Nazis or guided by their own conscience? The leaders of the Jewish communities, was appointed headship always equivalent to its leadership? Were there any other forces which could have taken the lead? Remembering the diverse Jewish world before the war, you must have understood that if prior to the war, Jews didn't have one leadership, the same is true regarding the Holocaust. Sometimes the accepted leader became part of the formal Jewish leadership. In other cases, they acted outside or even contradictory to it. Thus, Jewish leadership during the Holocaust consisted not only of members of the Judenrat or other formal organization but also known figures in the communities, such as rabbis or political activists, as well as leading figures who emerged during the war. Such as youth movement leaders, doctors or social activists. All of them tried to lead their circle in the world which was closing in on them. How will those people, accepted leaders, appointed authorities, or new emerging powers within the Jewish community, react when demanded by Nazi Germany to support, in one way or another, organizing the deportation of Jews to a threatening, unknown destiny? This will be a true watershed, which will tear communities, trouble the heavily battered conscious, and haunt the whole Jewish world for years. Yet to be discussed in the second part of our course.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-1/lecture/OnXWB/isolation-with-no-walls","Isolation with no walls","[MUSIC] The categorization process described before was a very important phenomena, which impacted the lives of millions of Jews. At even a short glance at a map of the measured ghettos can emphasize an important feature mentioned before. Ghettos were an Eastern European experience and in the Western and Southern part of the continent, the segregation of the Jews was implemented in different ways. In those countries, Jews were removed from the publics'. Not physically as by ghettos, but by other means, mainly legal restrictions. Decree after decree. Regulation after regulation. Jews were expelled from economic, social, and cultural arenas. Shrinkening their freedom and isolating them from the general society. Even without the need to build walls. 140,000 full Jews lived in the Netherlands according to Nazi definitions. Only about 16,000 of them were refugees while all the others had longstanding roots in the country from the 17th and 18th centuries. The lightning attack and immediate defeat of their homeland shocked many of them. Days after the capitulation of the country, dozens of Dutch Jews committed suicide. Yet, in the first month, anti-Jewish measures were at a very low scale. The German goal was to integrate the Dutch tribe into the Germanic family. They believed that it was possible to redeem the positive rational essence of the Dutch, and peacefully challenge the Netherlands into the new order. In September 1940, the German authorities started the planning of the systematic anti-Jewish measures. In October, November all people serving in the civil service, governmental, municipal, schools and universities, were ordered to sign an Aryan Declaration. Jews were consequently fired. The Dutch authorities, including the Supreme Court, gave in to these orders, which consequently affected even the Jewish Chairman of the Supreme Court, Judge. At the same time, Jews were ordered to register their enterprises enabling their registration. On January 10, 1941 registration of all Jews was ordered. With the introduction of identification cards, ID's for the Jews were stamped with a J. On Saturday the 22nd of February 1941, 389 young Jewish Dutch were brutally arrested in the streets of Amsterdam and sent to Buchenwald concentration camp, where 50 of them were killed. The others were taken further to the notorious camp of in Northern Austria. Within three weeks, all were murdered in cruel and sadistic manners. The Dutch Communist Party saw those act with her, but also as a moment to mobilize the masses against the occupier. And on the 25th of February, declared a strike in Amsterdam, which lasted two days and spread also to the surroundings of the city. Nazi forces violently broke up the protest, making clear their seriousness regarding the Jews. This was an impressive demonstration and actually the only strike that occurred throughout Europe as a protest against anti-Jewish steps. Yet, not only did it not repeat itself, it turned into a deceiving act. Many Dutch would benefit from the anti-Jewish measures. Others would be actively involved in them, including the implementation of the deportation that started in July 1942. Starting in January 1942, most of the Dutch Jews were gradually concentrated in Amsterdam and in the Westerbork Transit Camp, from which more than 100,000 of them would be deported. Mainly to the Nazi death camp, Auschwitz, and. Only about 5,000 of them would return. Those deadly destinations, to which most of the Dutch Jews were sent, contributed to the fact that the Netherlands become the Western European country with the largest percentage of Jewish victims. More than 75% of the Jew citizens perished during the war. There are, of course, other factors. As Dutch collaboration and the political culture of the Jewish community and its leadership to be discussed later. This high rate of Dutch Jewish casualties is especially puzzling when taking into account that 90% of it were very much integrated in their environment prior to the war. The fabric of the Jewish society in Belgium differed very much from both in French and Dutch Jewish societies. More than 90% of its 66,000 Jews were immigrants and refugees, mostly from Eastern Europe. Not Belgian nationals. Yet, the death toll here was much lower. Altogether, about 44% perished during the Holocaust. Many factors contributed to this lower rate, such as a German military rule, or. The characteristic of the Jewish community, with its many East European immigrants. Suspicious and alert regarding the authority's intention and more open to illegal activity. And no less important the early emergence of the Belgian resistance movement. And yet, almost 25,000 Jews from Belgium perished. Some, due to the Belgium collaboration, would certainly exist too. Not only countries which were under a direct Nazi rule and its many different manners acted against the Jews, but also many others. In Romania, which after the changing of borders at the end of World War I, had more than 700,000 Jewish citizens. Jews faced a radical rise of antisemitism from the mid-30's. Yet itwas only in August 1940, that Jews were deprived of all of their civil rights. And a rapid process of of Jewish businesses was launched. On the 27th of March, 1941 Romania declared all Jewish real estate had been confiscated. And that houses taken from Jews would be given to true Romanians. The next day, Mikhail Sebastian a young promising Jewish writer from Bucharest, wrote in his diary. I am distraught by what happened last night, and anxious about what will happen now. Previously- even under the Legionaries [the Iron Guard, the ultra nationalist, fascist and antisemitic Romanian movement which tried to overtake power in January 1941 and which launched a pogrom claiming the life of more than 120 Jews]- antisemitism was bestial but outside the law. That in a way was how it was excused. And at any moment, however formally, you could appeal to the authority of the state; a minimum of legality was preserved in official actions. Now, however, even that precarious sense of official justice has gone. In Slovakia, the puppet state which owed its existence to Nazi Germany, a special governmental office was established in order to promote anti-Jewish policies. In less than a year, totalarization was implemented, and by the summer of 1941 as Slovak soldiers joined the war, Slovakian Jews lost all the rights. The Jewish population was declining, not only in countries which tried to please Nazi Germany, but also in those which were its strongest allies. In Hungary and Italy, two of Nazi Germany most important partners, things weren't much better. True, their leaders tried to show their independence regarding the Jews and denied German offers to help them to solve the Jewish problem, but anti-Jewish rules were legislated in most countries as early as 1938. Sylvia Lombroso, an Italian Jewish woman, wrote in a diary about her husband. Eight o'clock. It was time to get up, to be on the move, time to go. But where? To do what? He went over to his work table and opened a registered letter. it was his last piece due to be serialized. The editor returns it herewith; A few embarrassed words, no longer able to proceed with the publication, most regretful, etc. He opens the next letter. The President of the Academy of Sciences wishes to advise that, following instructions received to that effect, he is removing his name from the membership list. The fearful sense of emptiness invaded him again. He saw suddenly and for the first time, how his only true reason for living had been torn from him. Thus, even without physical walls or establishment of ghettos, all throughout Europe, Jews were legally and socially segregated from their surroundings. Ties, which were carefully built over decades, as we saw in our previous meeting, broke in a few short months or even less. This was true tragedy, especially for Jews who saw themself as an integral part of those countries. Many felt that everything that Jews in the past have yearned for, everything which was until recently, within their reach, disappeared at once. But their exclusion from the civil society will have an effect, not only on Jewish feelings important as they are, but also on their practical faith. It will be this legal segregation of the Jews in Western European countries which will enable their physical expulsion and extermination. Not only because of Nazi Germany's acts or local initiatives, but because after years of discriminating laws and decrees, personal friendships and ties hardly existed. Deprived a common public sphere, Jew's could not share their growing despair or fear with most non-Jews. And when Jews will be taken away, this time permanently, meaning by their mass murders, Europe will not be shaken. Liberalism and humanistic values became one of many of Nazi Germany's victims.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-1/lecture/kd38t/the-warsaw-ghetto","The Warsaw Ghetto","[MUSIC] Hello again. After understanding how diverse Jewish faith in different ghettos was, I want us to try to answer some of the questions, raised before, regarding the Warsaw Ghetto. We have chosen the Warsaw Ghetto, not only because of its size, but also due to the vast documentation we have from it. In addition to dozens of diaries written by Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto due to personal motivations, thanks to the Oyneg Shabes Archive, sometimes called the Ringelblum Archive, thousands of documents written by many different people depicting numerous aspects of Jewish life in the Warsaw Ghetto are available for the researcher. On October 12th, 1940, Warsaw Jews were ordered by the Germans to move to a ghetto established in the midst of the city. The Warsaw Ghetto was still on the 15th of November, 1940, and its Jews found themselves surrounded by a three-meter high bricked wall, topped with barbed wire and broken glasses. The defined area was too small to contain all of them. Thus, in many flats several families were squeezed in together. Others, namely the ghetto refugees, were housed in public buildings such as former synagogues. About 380,000 Jews were crammed in less than 3.5 square kilometers, meaning about 30% of the population of Warsaw was limited to less than 2.5% of the city's territory. Later on, more Jews were pushed in, and some streets and buildings were taken out of the ghetto, worsening the situation even more. Initially, some Jews tried to see certain advantages in the establishment of the ghetto, thinking that it would protect them from the German atrocities and from the Polish reactions to them. Others hoped and believed that the forced isolation will increase Jewish solidarity. It had soon became clear that the ghetto questioned the very existence of Jews on a daily basis. Physical survival became the top concern of Warsaw Jews, the crowdedness in the ghetto, as well as the hunger. The German formal allocation for a Jew was 184 calories a day led to epidemics and huge mortality rates. Between November 1940, the establishment of the ghetto, and July 1942, the beginning of the great deportation from the ghetto to Treblinka death camp, more than 80,000 Jews died of hunger, disease and Nazi terror in the Warsaw Ghetto. German regulation and conducts created deadly conditions for the Jews. Death was horrible, but even life became an ongoing challenge in the Warsaw Ghetto. More than half of Warsaw Jews lost their livelihood or sources before the Ghetto was established. And in the ghetto things became worse. Yesterday's engineer was happy to be occupied today as a porter, a lawyer as a merchant of candies. A rich trader stands in line for free soup in the public kitchen. A professor of music plays in the street. Normal occupations, studies for years were worthless in the ghetto, and new means of income were very few. People received pennies, actually zlotys, for long hours of work in German factories established in the ghetto. Smuggling food to the starving ghetto, although promising some profit, was very dangerous. And only a few thousand could be occupied in the Judenrat administration. Actually, some of the Judenrat employees, such as the Jewish police initially established to keep order in the ghetto, didn't receive payment at all in the beginning, in fact which gave rise to bribery and corruption. Thus, parallel to the hundreds of thousands of Jews who are in an ongoing process of dying in Warsaw Ghetto, there existed a thin layer of wealthier Jews, less than 5% of the ghetto population. For most Jews selling property was the only option to gain money in the Warsaw Ghetto. In about a third of the ghetto, 150,000 of about half a million inhabitants at its peak were refugees, many of them originally from the western part of Poland. They had nothing to sell, thus were condemned to a certain death. Often an entire family perishes in one day or a few days, wrote Emmanuel Ringelblum towards the end of August 1941. There are a great many orphans, because the adults die first, especially the men. Infants up to the age of two do not live at all. If it goes on like this, the Jewish Question in Warsaw will be very quickly resolved. And still, in the midst of the loss, distress, and despair, social, cultural, religious activities took place. An underground system of schools, illegal newspapers, and even concert and cultural events were conduct, some in the hiding, and some very well seen in the public sphere. Kopel Pizyc, who supported some choirs into Ghetto including the children's choir wrote in hiding in 1944. Perhaps it will seem strange, perhaps it will be seem disconnected from the actual reality of the tragedy which occurred in our lives and yet it happened. On the one hand hunger, orphanhood, on the other hand, hunger for spiritual food and need for spiritual and intellectual development. This is very impressive. And no doubt the people involved in those activities were overwhelmed by them. But looking at the wider picture of the Warsaw Ghetto, those activities included only a very small segment of ghetto life. Less than 20,000 children of more than 100,000 studied in the ghetto, many of the others were wandering in the streets, since even the 30 plus institutions for abandoned children, which existed in the ghetto, could not meet the demand. As an example, Kortrijk famous orphanage could provide food and love only to about 200 children. Illegal newspapers, impressive as a word of the variety, circulated mainly among youth movement and political party members and did not have an impact on the rest of the ghetto who had to rely on Nazi imposed and monitored publications. And the most impressive cultural events were performed on the background of starvation and death. These contrasts are dishonoring the dignity of all the Jews of Warsaw, claims Stanislaw Rozycki, expressing the concern of Jewish intellectuals in the ghetto, as well as public activists. Many of them clearly felt that the chaotic reality of the life that German regulation created in the Ghetto had an impact, not only on Jewish life or death, but also on Jewish souls as private people and as a society. Jewish society could not sufficiently cope with the existing needs and was torn by unbearable questions and dilemmas. Ringelblum, who was not only the initiator of the clandestine ghetto but also a public activist in the Jewish self wrote in his diary, relief work doesn't solve the problem of hunger in the ghetto. It remains a proven fact that the people fed in the soup kitchens will all die if they eat nothing but the supplied soup and the dry ration bread. The question thus arises, whether it would not serve the purpose better to reserve the available money for selected individuals, for those who are socially productive, for the intellectual elite, etc. But the situation is such that, first of all, the number even of such selected individuals is quite considerable, and there would not be enough even for them. Secondly, the question arises why should one pronounce judgement on artisans, laborers, and other useful people, who were productive people back in their small towns. And only the ghetto and the war have turned them into non-people, into scrap, into human dreg, candidates for mass graves. There is left a tragic dilemma, what shall one do? Shall one hand out food with little spoons to everybody, and then no one will live, or in generous handfuls to just a few? A different example of the Jewish dilemma can be taken from the phenomenal snatchers, Chapers in Yiddish. This term in the inner ghetto language described people belonging to the most deprived layers, who upon seeing someone holding a food grabbed it and swallowed it on the spot. How could the ghetto fight Chapers, asked a senior Jewish policeman in his wartime memoirs. According to pre-war laws he should not be punished, a poor man stealing anything of small value, eating it on the spot. The situation here seems as such, yet there is a slight difference. The snatched product is not of small value. Food in the ghetto is of great value. The only punishment in such cases can be beating by angry passer-bys, since other measures, more desirable, as for example, to feed him, are impossible. The inhuman conditions which Nazi Germany created in ghettos, in general, and in Warsaw Ghetto in particular, not only cost the lives of many but also had an undermining effect on individual souls and social structures. As such, it had a shocking effect on family ties, as in the intimacy of [INAUDIBLE] couples, how can one maintain it in the [INAUDIBLE] of the ghetto, or parenthood and childhood? Many parents could not provide their children with sufficient food, not to mention other things such as education, protection or even love, and the terrifying horror we had at the penetrated children's games. But even parents who could think about their children's future had to decide whether to prepare them for a normal life hopefully to come soon. Or to cheat and beat in order to survive in the cruel reality of the ghetto. No one thought that the dreadful conditions of the ghetto would be a lesser evil than what was yet to come. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-1/lecture/qHYPh/ghettoization","Ghettoization","[MUSIC] Thank you for returning to us. In Eastern Europe marking of the Jews preceded their segregation in the Ghettos. On the 21st of September 1939 SS general Reinhardt Heinrich who headed the Reich Security Main Office sent the Schnellbrief, an express letter. To his similar subordinates in Poland, whose subject was Jewish Question in Occupied Territories. In the beginning of the document, which you can find below, Heydrich emphasized that the planned total measures, i.e., the final aim- Endziel, are to be kept strictly secret. Then, he distinguished between one, the final aim, which will require extended periods of time. And two, the stages leading to the fulfillment of this final aim, which will be carried out in short periods. What were those temporary steps that had to be taken? The annexed territories should be cleared of Jews, as discussed in our last lesson, while in the rest of occupied Poland Jews should be concentrated in large cities which are rail junctions or at least located on railroad lines. Temporary, as we said. But how should this concentration of the Jews be executed? Should Jews be constrained by special curfew hours? Should there be walls built around them in order to separate them from society? Will Jews be allowed to leave the Jewish area for work or in order to buy food? Neither this document or any other Nazi decree answered those questions. As a result, many different types of urban concentration forms, of ghettos, were established. First, in occupied Poland, later, all over eastern Europe. Here we must emphasize that ghettos established by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust were totally different from what is meant by the term ghetto as is often used to describe part of a city. Where a minority group lived due to their own choice or as a result of legal regulation or economic and social pressure. The Nazi ghettoes were segments of a city or a ton to which Jews were forced to live from all around. Usually neighborhood of poor Jews prior to the occupation this was a temporary mean, a stage in the process of total removal and elimination. No wonder tens of thousands of Jews died from harsh conditions which prevailed in the ghettos and millions suffered daily. For years, scholars believed that Nazi Germany established about 600 ghettos. Yet in recent years some basic and important research projects were carried out by and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum which revealed that more than 1,100 ghettos were established by Nazi Germany in the eastern part of Europe. Each and every ghetto is a different story. And its history was influenced by many factors, among them when was a ghetto established some in 1939, some later even as late as 1943 and 1944. It's size and type of porters. Some had high brick walls around them, others just signs. In some, only a few hundred Jews lived, others contained hundreds of thousands of Jews. The German forces who acted in it, civil administration says militarily or civilian industrials or as in the Soviet Union and Hungary, the involvement of local forces. As well as a character of the Jewish community to be held in it. We will not be able to explore here, all of the many different ghettos. Or delve into the various aspect of Jewish life shaped in them. Yet in order to better understand the wider phenomena of ghettoization, let's detail some of the questions we would like to ask ourselves. Where we will try and portray a complex life of a given ghetto. First, we have to understand where the ghetto was established. In a city or in rural places? Was there a forest nearby. How was the ghetto sealed? Was it hermetically closed? Did it have high walls or was it practically open? And did those borders change throughout time in their root or their character? And what about the Jews and the local population in the ghetto surroundings? Were there many Jewish refugees in the ghetto? Did its inhabitants know the area? Did they have any friends there or property nearby? Whether any special tensions, religious, economic, or political, which could have shaped the reaction of local non Jewish to the ghetto and its Jews? We should also ask ourselves how does Jews earn living in the given ghetto? Could they use their truest knowledge, ties, or assets? And what did he die from? Direct killing by the Germans, hunger, disease, despair. We might also want to know whether there were any cultural, political, educational or religious activities in the ghettos? Was there any Jewish solidarity and self aid. Or many hostility in an ongoing process of optimization of the Jewish society. We could go on, but I hope you understand how many different aspects of live the ghetto in general, and each and every given ghetto, in particular, demands. Jewish life in the ghetto, where more than half of its population were refugees Was different than the place where most of the Jews where locals. And nobody could flee from the ghetto to a forest if there wasn't any forest nearby. Or if he or she were city Jews who had seen forests only during vacations. Needless to say, many of those questions could not be answered in the absence of Jewish sources. Let's try and demonstrate the variety of ghettos with a short exercise. Checking five ghettos, Warsaw, Lodz, Krakow, Vilna, and Minsk and some basic data concerning them, 1. When was the place occupied? 2. When was the ghetto established? 3. When did great deportations to death camps start in it? 4. When was a large part of the Jewish community murdered? and 5. When was the ghetto destroyed? Warsaw ghetto seems to be the standard example. Occupied at the end of September 1939, established after more than a year later, November 1940, the great deportation to Treblinka started in it in July 1942, and it was destroyed during and following the Warsaw ghetto uprising of April 9, 1943. Krakow, which like the Warsaw ghetto was established within the borders of the General Government is a totally different story. Occupied in the first days of the war, this historical polish city became the capital of the General Government, and the seat of Hans Frank, its Governor General. The purpose was not only to insult the Poles by cancelling Warsaw as a capital But also humiliating them with Hans Frank living in the ancient Polish Royal palace, the Wawel. Yet for Frank, too many Jews were living in the city and in proximity to him and his German forces. Thus forty thousand of the sixty thousand Jews of Krakow were expelled out of the city in the second half of 1940. Even before the establishment of the Krakow Ghetto. In March 1941. Those Jews were turned into refugees in nearby towns, in the very first year of the war. The Krakow Ghetto, like the Warsaw Ghetto one, was destroyed in the first half of 1943. Yet the Lodz Ghetto, which established in April 1940, Seven months before the Warsaw ghetto, and almost a year before the Krakow one, existed until July August 1944. It was the last ghetto on Polish soil still operating when the Red Army liberated the eastern parts of Poland. And what about Vilna and Minsk in the territories occupied in 1941? Again a totally different story. Occupy days after the beginning of operation Balboza, in June 1941, mass murders began in both places within days or weeks. Unlike places mentioned until now, more than half of Vilna Jews, and a third of the Minsk Jews, were murdered even before the rapid establishment of the ghetto. Those skittles which were set up in September, Vilna. In November, Minsk of 1941 contained only the remains of a battered and bruised community. Husbands without wife, parents with no children. To make things even more complicated, right after the mass murder ended, thousands of German Jews were deported to the Minsk Ghetto to inhabited the empty houses of the murdered Jews. For the local Jews, it was a horrible site. For the German Jews, brought from Dusseldorf, Hamburg, Frankfort, or Berlin, their brutal evacuation from their homeland. The difficult condition of the Belarusian winter. And the primitaveness of the houses in which they were housed were shocking. Referring to ghettos, we often imagine Warsaw Lodge. The two biggest ghettos established by Nazi Germany in which hundreds of thousands of Jews were imprisoned. Yet, most of East European jews numbering millions were not concentrated in Warsaw or Launch but in much smaller places. Their experience is not less important. We're opening a forum in which you could add additional ghettos to this exercise and we will add some of your data to this chart, but I hope that even by now you understand the diversity of the Nazi ghetto's. With no direct and clear German order as shown in the beginning of this unit, the Jewish faith in each and every ghetto was different. To borrow Leo Tolstoy's first sentence of Anna Karenina, all happy families are alike. Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-1/lecture/fDPtd/the-jewish-perspective-and-the-badge-of-shame","The Jewish perspective and the Badge of Shame","[MUSIC] Hello. In previous lessons, we focused on policy, state, and society at large. Yet today, in our last meeting of the first part of the course, I want us to focus on individuals and human interactions. How did various Jewish societies react to their situation constantly getting worse, and what were their major concerns? Moreover, if previously, we have said that in a context of Nazi German ideology and local conditions, this session will be dedicated to Jewish experiences. Jewish hopes and fears, understandings, and illusions. Yet, as noble as aspiration of detecting Jewish life during the holocaust is, we must ask our self, isn't it too ambitious? Is it really possible to describe and understand, human experiences in such extreme conditions? Can we trace today, decades after the tragic events, what is known, felt, or understood during those terrifying days? And what are the sources that can expose those internal worlds? Well, first and foremost, though not only, Jewish accounts. That is to say, documents written by Jews during the Holocaust or after it ended. This defined radically difficult conditions. Jews throughout Europe wrote quite extensively during the Holocaust. We have official Jewish documents such as protocols or newspapers, as well as private ones, diaries, letters, paintings and some unique Jewish photograph collections. There were even a few projects designed during the war for this purpose only, documentation of Jewish lives. The extent of Jewish writing in the midst of the horror is not only impressive but also quite exceptional. Moreover, after the Holocaust ended, all over Europe, Jews were questioned about their experiences. Tens of thousands of survivors testimonies were collected, and many survivors wrote their memoirs. All of this Jewish documentation serve as an important tool for us historians. Yet, just as any other historical source, Jewish documentation also imposes some challenges and problems. One of the most basic questions asked regarding documents composed immediately after the Holocaust, and even those written during the events itself, is what significance can there be to something written by this or that Jew, who knew nothing about the big picture and of the steps planned to be taken against him. Other questions are raised regarding memories of holocaust survivors, especially those written decades after the events. Such as, do they remember correctly, do they really recall each and every detail which occurred 50, 60, 70 years ago? Those are good methodological questions. Question which examine, not the historical reality of a given event, but the way we historians use our sources in order to establish it. But, before challenging those sources, let's experience their usage. Thus, first we will examine different aspects of Jews experience, by using Jewish sources, as well as German or local ones. Only towards the end of our meeting today, we'll return to those mythological questions and assess the value of word accounts or later documents written by Jews to our understanding of the Holocaust. Though it took the Nazi regime time to build up the broad variety of means for the physical removal of the Jews from human society, I mean mass murder. The goal of their elimination from the public sphere was rooted very well in Nazi ideology. Marking of the Jews and their segregation were essential steps on the way, although in different places one came before the other. Stressing Jewish foreigners in the greater German Reich, was carried out even before the outbreak of the second World War. During the 30s, German Jews were not physically marked, many still felt very much singled out. In 1938, this feeling was extremely intensified, due to the imposition of obligatory Jewish names and the stamping of Jewish documents. Yet German Jews would be forced to wear a yellow Jewish star on their clothes, and not only on their souls, only in September 1941, a month before their deportations to the east started. As in many other steps taken against the Jews, this policy of physically marking them, was implemented in occupied Poland much earlier. Days after the occupation of Lodz, Jews were ordered to mark their businesses with a yellow star. Later on, Jews in the annexed areas were demanded to wear a yellow star, and those of the Generalgouvernement were forced to wear a white arm band with a blue Star of David on it. As soon as the USSR would be occupied, the physical marking of the Jews will be rapidly enforced. In the West it took more time, mainly out of policy consideration vis-a-vis the local populations, that that Jews were forced to wear a yellow badge at the end of April 1942, the Belgium Jews and the French Jews of the occupied zone at the beginning of June 1942. And in November 1942, with occupation of all of France by the Germans, as a reaction to the allies landing in North Africa, this decree, first declined by Vichy, France was imposed on all Jews. Marking of the Jews in West, as in Germany, always preceded the deadly depredation by weeks or months. Meanwhile, pocket states such as Croatia, July 1941, and Slovakia, September 1941, also marked their Jews, as well as Allies of the Germans such as Romania in August 1941 or Bulgaria in August 1942. Though the Badge of Shame differed in it's forms, an arm band, a button, or a badge, as well as the ages forced to wear it, it always had the same purpose, marking of the Jews. How did Jews feel when demanded to identify them self for all to see with this Badge of Shame? When those orders were issued, even those who were proud of their Jewishness felt humiliated and terrified. Humiliated since they were not seen anymore for what they were, personally or professionally. They were not observed as parents or people, lawyers or workers, but as Jews. And all of their past achievements were dissolved, leaving only their Jewishness. Moreover, Jews were very worried about the local reactions to their Jewish mark. Will their neighbors mock them? Will their friends turn their backs on them? Or will they show compassion and empathy? Some Jews tried to avoid wearing the Badge of Shame, as Janusz Korczak, The famous Polish Jewish educator, writer and doctor. He saw himself as Polish and not only Jewish, and despised the German orders. Yet Korczak was imprisoned by the Nazis for disobeying the order. Others tried to use a German marking as a protest, such as Helene Berr, a French student in her 20s, who attached to the yellow star the French tricolor. Berr encountered different reactions, carefully documented in her diary. My God, I never thought it would be so hard. I was very courageous all day long. I held my head high, and I stared at other people so hard that it made them avert their eyes. But it's difficult. In any case, most people don't even look. In the street two boys pointed at us and said, eh, you see that? Jew. Otherwise, things were normal. There was a woman on the bus, probably a maid, who had smiled at me in the queue, and she turned around several times to smile at me again. A well groomed gentleman stared at me. I couldn't make out the meaning of his stare, but I returned it with pride. Another working class woman smiled at me on the metro. It brought tears to my eyes, I don't know why. Less than two weeks later, her father Raymond Berr, a scientist and a first World War French hero, one of the 16 French Jews protecting due to their outstanding contribution to the French state in the fields of literature, science, and art, was arrested by the French police and transferred to German hands. He was murdered in Auschwitz. His offence was, that his yellow star was not sewn to his suit as demanded by the decree. The marking of the Jews made them a visible target for abuse, not only for the Germans, which could now easily distinguish between Jews and non-Jews, but also for the local population. It is well mentioned throughout Europe, west and east, mixed reactions were noted. In the Netherlands some non-Jewish Dutch wore the Jewish symbol as a sign of solidarity. Yet the story of the Danish king or other European nobles, wearing the marking of the Jews as a protest against Nazi Germany decree, is nothing more then a legend. Some non-Jewish European citizen gloated, other expressed terror at the tragedy of the Jews, yet most turned a blind eye. Were they ashamed? Were they afraid? Were they too occupied with their own problems? All these answers might be true, but Jews understood it as indifference. While they were forced to wear the Badge of Shame by threat of death, daily life throughout Europe continued. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/lesson-design/lecture/yQJrC/video-3-instructional-design-theory-present-by-staying-present","Video 3: Instructional Design Theory: Present by Staying Present","[MUSIC] Welcome back to teach English now. In the previous lesson, we watched three teachers in action as they began a class and successfully or unsuccessfully managed to perform Gagne's first three events of instruction. Now let's discuss the next three events, and discuss how and when these events should be implemented. The next three events from Gagne's nine events of instruction are, present the content, provide learner guidance, and elicit performance, or practice. Let's talk about presenting the content. Presenting the content refers to the idea of demonstrating, and sharing, speaking, and presenting, carefully constructing a lesson by explicitly giving information that will help learners understand material. In our first course, foundational principles, a lot of time was spent on discussing the use of teacher talk. Here is where you would do a lot of teacher talk, explaining, breaking down, scaffolding and well, to be honest, being front and center. Ideally, a teacher isn't presenting for the entire class period. If you remember, we shared the 80 / 20 rule which informed us of the goal of presenting information only 20% of the time, while allowing students practice 80% of the time. But don't let this ideal goal make you undervalue the instruction because that 20% of instruction is truly vital to the success of your class. Let me add one more thing, use warm language when you present content. Why warm language? Well, in an extensive study of the best college teachers in America, Ken Bain discovered that one of the most powerful shared attributes of the best teachers, was the ability to use warm language. Do you want to be the best? Of course you do and warm language may be a key. So, what is warm language? It is the ability to communicate from the inside out, to share ideas that excite and help students anticipate a future conclusion. Bain explained that being a good teacher is like telling a story. For example, maybe you've heard this one before. >> There was a story about this little girl and three bears, and how she went to their house, and when they were gone, she tried and tasted everything and then they came home and discovered her. >> Sound like a familiar story? Yes, it is Goldilocks and the three bears. But did you feel like you were inside the story? Was there a sense of intrigue or excitement? No, the language was cool and detached. It was informational, but feels irrelevant, like a user's manual, or an online terms and conditions that you just go down to the bottom of the page and accept. Now consider the same story, but told using warm language. >> Once upon a time there was a girl named Goldilocks. She had fine golden hair and was dancing through the forest when suddenly she stopped. What did she see? A large house owned by three bears. >> This story is warm. It brings you in, helps you feel like you are there in the story. In other words, warm language is a bit like story telling and it can be done even when you aren't telling stories. When you're explaining grammar, punctuation, vocabulary or any kind of principle, think about how to use warm language. When you present content, make sure you do so in a lively engaging manner. A way that draws students in, and makes them motivated to learn more. Clear explanations, warm language that invites students to problem solve with you, the use of story and metaphor. All of these techniques can help you to present language in a pleasing manor. After all, like we keep on saying, language is cake. Now, let's discuss the concept of providing learner guidance. At this stage of instruction, the point is to no longer be the sage on the stage, but rather the guide on the side. Your role changes. You move from instructor to helper. And your job at this stage is to provide assistance as learners attempt to recall, use, or apply the information you have given them. In course one of teach English now, we call this guided practice. Benjamin Bloom, another learning theorist, suggest that there are different ways to get students to interact with learning and that a good instructor is able to get students to think and examine critically. In some sense, this is the time for students to play with language, make mistakes, figure out how certain rules work and the words work and interact with each other in order to acquire language. At this stage students may not be able to do things on their own, but in pairs or in groups or with you as a teacher, they are able to work together and accomplish a task. Finally, let's discuss eliciting performance. This, for some teachers, represents the final stage of a lesson. After you have given instruction and provided guided practice opportunities, all that's left is to have students demonstrate understanding of your instruction. This part of the lesson is actually a mixture of practice and evaluation. In course one of teach English now, we mentioned independent practice, and this part of the lesson is where students would be given time to practice independently, and show you that they understand what you've taught them. It is also your opportunity as a teacher to evaluate your learners, and determine if they have learned anything, or not. It is the student's time to perform, it is your time to assess. Now, a performance can be a test, a presentation, a group activity, a question and answer session, there are all kinds of ways to do it. But the point is that when you illicit a performance, you move away from being a presenter, presenting the content or a coach providing learning guidance and now you become an evaluator. In this new capacity you are allowing students to present their knowledge and or competence of the contents you have perviously presented and worked on together. So what ties all three of these events together? Well, at least a couple of things. First, these three events involve direct interaction with the material you are trying to present. Presentation and practice of material when done well can encourage long term learning and acquisition and inspire students to do their best. Second, these events all involve the exchange of information from teacher to student. Think of it as the passing of a baton. First, you are in charge of the information. Then you and students together are in charge of the information. And finally, you let go of the information and give it to students alone. All right, so now that we understand these three events, let's watch teachers in action. In the next video, you'll see three fearless teachers attempt to teach a small lesson. See you there and thanks for watching teach English now. [MUSIC]",""

We will discuss how to create sound learning objectives, lesson plans that consider the end from the very beginning, and give you a general view of how lesson plans are designed. >> We will also give you a little background into theories of instructional design, and give you an overview of ways in which to engage your learners at each step of the learning process. During several videos we will spend time trying to share not only how to plan and teach a lesson, but we will spend time showing you how not to plan and teach. Our hope is that you will avoid some of the common pitfalls of language instruction. We are doing this so that you don't fall victim to the same mistakes that many of us have committed on our way to becoming language teaching professionals. >> I sure made a lot of mistakes when I was a young teacher. You know, what you said reminds me of a saying. Smart people learn from their own experiences, but super smart people learn from other people's experiences.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/qualitative-methods/lecture/AxQWN/1-7-pragmatism","1.7 Pragmatism","The third foundation of philosophy that is really important for quality of research and has really made school, especially in symbolic interactionism for instance, is pragmatism. And pragmatism is another reason why you can spend years and years in library reading all kinds of different views on what pragmatism actually is and what forms of pragmatism we can find. Or do we need to call it pragmaticism rather than pragmatism. But I'll just try to give a superficial overview of pragmatism. What is pragmatism? What is so pragmatic about it? Well pragmatism started in the United States at the end of the 19th century and central figures in pragmatism are Charles Sanders Pierce, William James and John Dewey, and later George Herbert Meade and some would say that the Thomases were pragmatists as well. And the central idea of pragmatism is that researchers try to focus completely on practical issues. Now what are these practical issues then? Well maybe let's define it negatively. What are not practical issues? Well non practical issues are issues that arm chair philosophers were thinking about. And just like pragmatists would focus on, okay, let's look at what is relevant for us. For science, for researchers, for people, and not so much about what is nice to sit and ponder about and have intellectual debates, but are not practical in life, in science, and so on. So where do these pragmatists look at? Well, they look at all aspects of social life that have practical relevance for an investigation. And they try to get everything that is of practical relevance into this research. So there's not a very small focus of the research. And pragmatists have worked a lot, and especially Charles Sanders Peirce, on logic. How do we use logic in order to do empirical science and they've focused a lot on what is called a fallibalist view of science. Which means that they look at knowledge as temporary. They looked as knowledge as useful as long as it is practical. As long as we can use it, and if it turns out we are wrong, well we maybe have to put it aside. Or if we are wrong, but it's still useful, then we maybe should use it. So that was a total pragmatic view of knowledge. We do not have to be right per se. No we can use wrong knowledge as long as it is practical. You don't have to think about the world all the time as a globe. Whereas thinking about the world as flat might be useful sometimes. The central maxim we always read when we read something about pragmatism, and you always hear it when you hear something about pragmatism is this pragmatist maxim. And that says, consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. So consider that. Then our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object. As all maxims in social science or in philosophy, you have to think about three or four times about this one. What does it say? Well, you might remember that other maxim or theorem. If man defines situations as real, they're real and they're consequences. The Thomas Theorem. This says more or less the same. Our conception of the effects is the whole of our conception of the objects. So, if we define situations as real, it doesn't really matter if it's real or not, if we define situations as real, they're real in their consequences. So, if we define Pastoralists turning into elephants? It doesn't matter if it really happened, from a pragmatist point of view. It only matters if we believed it happened. And if we believed it happened, and it's useful for us, then it is pragmatic. Now again, this is pretty hard, and do we need this? Is David Silva right by saying we shouldnt be discussing all these philosophical concepts for a cause on qualitative research or a book on qualitative research? I guess hes right. At least he's partly right. But, many people do so we need to discuss it and we need to know it, but do you need to put it in a research paper? Well, probably not, only if necessary. Maybe, let's give it a pragmatic thought. If it is practical, you would use it. If it's not, you wouldn't.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/qualitative-methods/lecture/PSkna/1-6-phenomenology","1.6 Phenomenology","The second foundational philosophies of qualitative research that I would like to discuss is phenomenology. And again, phenomenology might be a reason never to leave the library again, because there's a huge amount of books that have been written about phenomenology and they are pretty hard to read also. So probably you will spend some years in library, if you really want to grasp the essence of phenomenology. And probably, phenomenology is just about that. Phenomenology started out in the early 20s and century, late 19th century. And it started mainly in German language countries among professors working at universities, philosophers working at universities, such as and later, Edith Stein or and. And what they try to do in phenomenology was some kind of a positive science in the sense that as other contemporaries, they try to place their philosophies against the metaphysical background of 19th century and especially earlier philosophies. So what they tried to do was to have, rather empirical philosophy of science or philosophy and what do phenomenologists do? What is phenomenology? Well, phenomenology tries to get the pure meaning of phenomenon and they say, it can only be understood subjectively and intuitively and then grasp in its essence. So it tries to grasp the pure meaning of a phenomenon in its essence intuitively and subjectively. And some would even say, for instance, Edith Stein would say through, I'm feeling through empathy. So only through empathy, we can understand each other. Whereas other phenomenologists would say no, not at all. We have to use our logic as well and it's not just empathy. So there's a huge range of phenomenologists, but the central idea is to grasp pure meaning in its essence subjectively and there's a second aspect and this second aspect is that phenomenologists study the conscious experience. And not just a conscious experience of anything, not just armchair philosophy. No, they try to study conscious experience of something. When you think, you think about something. And therefor, you are, not just because you think. And they look at how subjects, people, members of societies, actors, whatever you call them as well as researchers experience this phenomena, consciously. So this consciousness is an important word as well as of something, because you're conscious about something. So if phenomenology is about trying to grasp the meaning of phenomenon consciously by using experience. Phenomenology is do this. Phenomenology, do this its protection. Well, there are different strengths of phenomenology. And as a grandparent of many strands of qualitative research philosophies or ideas, such as ethnomethodology or adnofemininology or phenomenography, it plays a huge roll in contemporary qualitative research. But how do phenomenologists do phenomenology? How do they do their interpretations? Well, in general, there are three different methods of interpretations in phenomenology according to Woodruff Smith. The first is a pure description of a lived experience. How does that work? Well, for instance, if your cat has died, then you feel the loss for that cat. Or maybe you're happy about it, I don't know, but you feel the loss of losing your cat. So what you try to do as a phenomenologist is try to describe this lost and this feeling of lost as pure as you can. So, it's a pure description of a lived experience. Now that's one way, it's the first step. A second step or a second method is trying to interpret the kind of experience by relating it to relevant context. So relating it to the loss of people probably or the loss of other animals or other pets that you have and you try to look at it in a certain context. The loss of your cat, it is terrible, but probably the loss of a person near you is much more terrible, so you try to put it in a context. You try to interpret the kind of experience, a feeling of loss, a feeling of losing an animal or person or whatever and then you try to analyze the form of the experience. So you try to analyze, how this feeling of loss works? Probably for different persons, probably for you, as a researcher or as a person yourself. So that's the third step and it's the classical triad between description, interpretation and analysis. All qualitative research has description, interpretation as well as analysis. But then again, how does this work? Because you have this description, this interpretation and this analysis. And you try to grasp the essence of a meaning, but how do you do this? Well, the central word in phenomenology is the word introduced by Husserl and that word is bracketing. How does this work? Well, we take the world around us as natural. And as phenomenologists, what we're trying to grasp the essence of a meaning, we place the naturalness between brackets. So we act as if it is just an appearance of loss rather than loss itself. It's an appearance of loss and we try to analyze this loss for this animal, for this cat as an appearance in order to grasp the real essential part of this phenomenon. Now that sounds pretty vague, doesn't it? And it's pretty hard and it's still philosophy, still a bit armchair philosophy, hypothetical situations. Now, Alfred who was a banker during the daytime was a brilliant philosopher and social scientist at night, because what he did was he tried to apply the ideas of Husserl and Shayla, but also James and he was corresponding with Talcott Parsons at the same time. So he was embedded in social science and what he tried to do was to create a phenomenology of the social world. And what he says is well, if we take this bracketing and if we look at how people in their daily life act towards the world, they act towards the world as if it is natural to them. Of course, because otherwise, you'd go nuts. If you go around and when you meet people, you continuously think okay, this is just an appearance, there's something else behind it, you'll get crazy. So we act towards the world as if it is natural. And in order to do so, we use different typifications of people, but also of situations. So let's say, someone comes up to me and says, well, my cat has died. I will try to support that person, because that is the typical recipe. Oh, my cat has died I am so sorry for you and how old was your cat and there are rules about how to do this, how to give this support. Talk about the cat a bit and why it was such a nice animal or not and it would be really weird, if someone says my cat has died and I'm so happy about it, because he ruined my couch or something like that. That's untypical, but it is a reaction, but it's not the standard recipe. So the standard recipe is to support people and what we call this in phenomenology is first order constructs. So people typify the world and we call these typifications first order constructs and we do this in interaction. Now, says if we use first order construct as lay persons, as members of society, then what do we use as social scientists? So as social scientists, we still use constructs, but we try to use constructs that go beyond denaturalists. And therefore, as phenomenological social scientists, we use doubt and bracketing, continuous doubt. Now if we have first order constructs, obviously, we also have second order constructs. And these second order constructs are the constructs, we as social scientists use. And these are slightly different from these first order constructs, because we use theory and we try to go beyond the naturalness. We try to go beyond the appearances and we put brackets around it and we use doubt. And by doing that, we create constructs that are on a slightly higher level than normal level of typifications, but they're still typifications. And one can discuss whether this a total construction as well and late, r phenomenologists did exactly that.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/qualitative-methods/lecture/inmpr/1-5-hermeneutics","1.5 Hermeneutics","After telling you about ontology and epistemology, I think it's pretty important to tell you something about hermeneutics. But let me first explain to you why I used this very weird title. It's because of this man, David Silverman. He says in his book on qualitative research, I have lost count of the run of the mill qualitative research papers I have come across which find it necessary to define their work in terms of obscure philosophical positions such as phenomenology or hermeneutics. You will not find either of these terms in the glossary of this book for one simple reason. In my view, you do not need to understand these terms in order to carry out good qualitative research. Indeed, if you try to understand them, my guess is that you will not emerge from the library for many years. And that's why, Professor David Silverman, that's why we are going to explain to you a little bit about hermeneutics because otherwise you will spend the rest of your life in library, and I think it is pretty important to know something about hermeneutics. So, how to never emerge from the library again? Well, start reading about hermeneutics, and maybe I can help you a bit by just giving you a starting point. Okay, hermeneutics, where does this term come from? As you all read in any introduction, it comes from Plato, who says that every messenger, messengers such as the god Hermes, every messenger has to interpret the message in order to convey a message. So, hermeneutics is about interpreting messages, and conveying messages. And, Aristoteles was the first one who actually wrote about hermeneutics, or Peri Hermeneias, and what he said was, every text has a part that is called the Elecutio. It detects itself. It's the explanation in a text, and after that you have the interpretation by you, the reader, or by a scholar as a reader. So you have the text as well as an interpretation on top of the text. And then you have the explicatio, the text of the interpreter. Which means that you have the text, you have the interpretation of the text, as well as the explication of the interpreter. That's another text. That's another layer. There are three translations going on there. And in hermeneutics, we try to look at how do we come to these interpretations in such a way that it's clear, that it's traceable, that others could have done it as well? An important tradition in hermeneutics is the Biblical hermeneutics. As with any Holy book, whether it's the Koran, whether it's the Bible, whether it's the Torah, other Holy books, we need to interpret those books. As believers, or as scholars. But at least believers need to interpret those books, because often these books, usually these books give guidance in life. So what is this guidance, and how do we need to interpret this? And, therefore, in these three large traditions, but in other religious traditions as well, we have a tradition of how to interpret these texts, and usually this is done on small verses in the larger context of the complete holy text. And one example I would like to stress is, Augustine of Hippo. Because Augustine of Hippo was an interesting man. He partied and danced and drank for quite some time in his life. And then at one point, while he was sleeping, God called him and asked him to turn his life to religion. And he started focusing on the Bible. Starting reading the Bible and interpreting the Bible. And he wrote about this in his confessions. And, what he says is that, if you study a holy text, let's make it a little broader than just the Bible. If you study a holy text or a text, and you interpret this text, then you have the text itself plus the interpretation. And when you start rereading the text, you have to add up to your interpretation. And you have to reread your interpretation. So what you start to do when you follow the hermeneutics of Augustine of Hippo, you will have to read the text, write your interpretation, reread the text, rewrite your interpretation, reread your interpretation, reread the text, and so on and so forth. And while doing that, he suggests you can strive for divine truth. Now, another very famous philosopher, and actually our best philosopher in the Netherlands, Spinoza, who was very famous for his new view of God. Totally in contrast to all Einstein's ideas but very interesting addition to the hermeneutics, to how to interpret text, because what did Spinoza said. Well, if you look at texts, you do not just interpret the text, so you do not just add another layer. You have to look at the text in its context. And not just diverse, but diverse in its context, and not just in the context of the same book, but probably in the opus of the author, or even broader in a certain period of time and after Spinoza said probably went in a cultural field, and then probably within a certain language. And then going back again. So, from the small verses, go to the text, go to the context, a wider context probably, and then go back again. If we combine the ideas of Augustine with the ideas of Spinoza, what we have is these two very central ideas of the hermeneutic circle, and these are, knowledge can not be considered independently of the knowing person. So, Augustine read the bible, interpreted the bible, re-read the bible, re-read his interpretation. So he played a role in his interpretation. Now that's part one. Going back and forth within the known person, and second, every person and all knowledge is embedded in a certain context. So in order to understand texts, we have to understand them in a certain context. What does this have to do with qualitative research? Well, a lot, because we usually look at the world as text. So even if we've done interviews, even if we did observations, if you imagine them as text, we have an observation with an interpretation within a context, in a certain period of time. And what we have is a circle of data, theory, data, theory within a context.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/qualitative-methods/lecture/fJ6yP/1-3-ontology-for-social-researchers","1.3 Ontology for social researchers","In many textbook, people would only discuss ontology for social actors. But I think it's also important to discuss ontology for researchers. When describing a herd of elephants, we cannot just describe the biggest elephant. Ontology for social actors. We also need to describe the smaller but more angry one. This one is ontology for researchers. Qualitative researchers tend to focus a lot on this part of this graph, on the typology, on the types of pragmatism and constructivism. And why? Because we would say, as qualitative researchers, social reality is a construct. We construct reality. Social actors construct reality out there. They create meaning, and this meaning becomes so important, that sometimes these meanings are locally accomplished realities. Or, in this sense, are versions of a reality out there. But local versions, locally constructed versions. Since the 1930s, we have the famous Thomas Theorem. And this famous Thomas Theorem says, if men define situations as real, they're real in their consequences. Which is a very pragmatist view of social reality. Because it doesn't matter whether or less a reality out there, as long as it's usable and as long as people define it as real, it's real in their consequences. So we do not need to look at whether it's real or not. Now many qualitative researchers agree with this sentence. Because they say, what we're studying is how people create reality. However, there's a serious critique on this view. And the serious critique is that, if we say that if men define situations as real, and they're real in their consequences, we should also consider ourselves. And this is what people tend to forget. People tend to forget that as researchers, we also define situations as real and then they're real in the consequences. So, if we say, social actors construct reality and we, as scientists, can simply come and grab them. Then we tend to forget that we scientists are part of the social world ourselves as well. And if you tend to forget that, Hammersley and Atkinson would say, that you're a naturalist. You believe that you, by participant observation or any other methodology, can grasp a reality out there pretty unproblematically. So, if we make a new graph with new types in there. We still have constructivism, we still have objectivism, but we can say that people that say that they're doing research on the construction of reality or construction of a single reality or a more pragmatist position. They actually tend to view themselves and their own research from a more objectivist point of view. As a researcher, I know how truth works. And what Hammersley and Atkinson suggest is to take a more subtle realist position. So It's not exactly the same as pragmatism, but it's in the same corner where you would say, there is a reality, a social reality out there. But this is partly created by you as a researcher, by me as a researcher. We, as researchers, are part of the social world we study, and we should never forget that. We are also co-constructing by looking at a material, having a certain focus, using certain methodology, we partly construct the data we are studying. But a subtle realist would say, there's still that social phenomena out there. It's not a complete figment of the researcher. There is a reality out there that we study. And I believe this is a pretty sensible way of dealing with both construction as well as reality.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/qualitative-methods/lecture/PCRUr/1-0-introduction","1.0 Introduction","A very warm welcome to this massive open online course on qualitative research methods. My name is Gerben Moerman. And I'm very honored that you are taking time to watch this video, and probably even watch the other lectures. And it would be so cool if you'll also join in with the assignments. Because learning qualitative research method is not something that is done binge watching from your comfortable armchair. But it's a craft that you also learn by doing. I think it's amazing that so many people from around the world are eager to learn something about qualitative research. Thank you for that. And in this course, I will try not to disappoint you. The main objective of this course is to introduce you to qualitative research methods. And in order to do so, I will do three things. First, I will explain about two of the most important modes of data collection. And those are observation and qualitative interviewing. Second, I will try to give you some ideas on different forms of qualitative analysis. And third, I want to touch on important concepts, issues and discussions in qualitative research. So I will introduce you to some discussions in philosophy of science that are relevant to qualitative research. I will talk about the quality of qualitative research. I will also discuss some ethical issues, issues of representation and mixing methods. All topics I touch upon deserve a complete course in itself, so some of my colleagues would say that it's ridiculous to discuss qualitative analysis in just a few videos. But please don't forget, it's just an introduction. So that's the objective of this course. My great hope for this course is that in some way, I can inspire you to do qualitative research yourself. And also to inspire you to get involved in debates on qualitative research. And in order to try to inspire, we ended up not using auto ques. So I simply prepare the lectures, use my sheets to structure and then try to show my enthusiasm and passion. This has a flip side though. Sometimes, I'm terrible messy. I use weird sentences. I have a quirky and inconsistent pronunciation. I have very lame jokes and I will never ever stand still. I'm sorry, that's just the way it is. But do not hesitate to comment on contest aspects, such as unclear parts of the lectures. Then please send us a short note and we will look into it. Qualitative research methods is a highly debated field with different schools of thoughts and people claiming to use completely different philosophies of social science. And I have my favorites as well. I, too ,have blind spots and a pretty blinkered view. And, therefore, I will sometimes reflect on my own position and relate my claims and argumentation to various scholars of qualitative methodology. I will refer to them. Obviously. And all references used in the lectures are added to the readings of that week. And sometimes, additional references will be given as well. We also tried to have open access material as much as possible. Again, video lectures alone and small assignments do not make you a good quality researcher overnight. And my suggestion is to read a lot, discuss, reflect. But mostly do what Robert Park suggested his students. And that is, and I quote, go and sit in the lounges of luxury hotels and on the doorsteps of the flophouses. Sit on the Gold Coast settees and on the slum shakedowns. Sit in the Orchestra Hall and in the Star and Garter Burlesque. In short, go and get the seat of your pants dirty in real research. End of quote. So to get your pants dirty in real research, we devised three rather big practical assignments. The first big assignment in week two is on observation. You're asked to meticulously observe a social situation. Describe it in a very detailed manner. And then interpret what you saw. And we hope that, due to the intercultural backgrounds of all the participants from around the world. We will build up a rich data set that we can analyze as well. The second big assignment will be, that every participant has to do an interview and reflect on it. The third big assignment will be on analysis. You will have to analyze some material. Obviously, there will be peer-reviewed discussion assignments, and a few quizzes to test your knowledge. Now, I want to thank all the colleagues from all over the world, for watching some of the videos and then commenting on them. Thank you for all the discussions. And obviously, all mistakes that are still in the videos are mine. I want to thank the following people here at the University of Amsterdam, Anna Marie for the general project management, her advice, and her great help in setting up this course. I want to thank Marie for her great illustration and especially for her creative thinking about abstract quality of concepts. And then make illustrations out of them. I want to thank and for filming, editing the complete production of the video's in general. And I want to Thank them specifically for the patience they had when filming the 20th take of drama theory, and I started using very bad words. I want to thank Sonya Hoekstra for meticulously going through all the videos, and her advice on the content, her support and general organization of the course. And thank you for joining in. And if you enjoyed the course, we have many more courses here in the University of Amsterdam. For now, enjoy Qualitative Research Methods, and get the seat of your pants dirty in real research.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/soulbeliefs3/lecture/JfvtG/introduction","Introduction","Hi, welcome, my name is Dan Ogilvy and I'm introducing unit three. Of the sole beliefs that causes inconsequence of soul and afterlife beliefs? And this unit is called How Does It End? I think, how does it all end? And I'm asking, how does what end? I mean, how audacious it would be to give a course on soul and afterlife there's just so many questions, and my colleague and I, Len Hamilton, say, well, this is how it ends. Well, obviously, it hasn't end, and won't end. Oh yes, and here's Professor Hamilton's. There's five lectures in this section, I think. And Professor Hamilton, who calls himself a brain scientist, he gives a very nice lecture, and several lectures, on the evolution of the human brain. And you will at the end of his lecture know quite a bit about the what's it's refered to as a Triune brain, the brain stem, and, the mid-brain, which is primarily the, emotional center of the brain. And then the, neommalian brain, which, what we all see when you, the encasement. What the outside of the brain looks like. Then, I'll talk about the human spark. What's the human spark? Well, it's consciousness, awareness. How did we become able to be conscious of things, talk to each other? Language is a very much part of this talk on human spark. And then he deals quite a bit with the trial, the controversy between Intelligent Design and the Theory of Evolution. That runs pretty much throughout units one and units two of the course. And he brings that together and at the end, and then another video on the continuation of the debate against Intelligent Design and Evolution. And then where do we go from here? That completes the five of lectures in this. Now, I mentioned that there's been ongoing and very serious debate between Intelligent Design and Evolution. Briefly. I hope I can really quickly tell the story. This kid goes to the mother and says, how do we get to be here? And the mother said, God put us here. And that kid then goes to the father and says, well, how did we get to be here? And he said, well, several billion years ago, when the Earth began to cool, and these warm pools were developed, a perfect environment for the emergence of molecules, et cetera. The story of evolution. It all started out in the muck. So, the kid goes to the mother, and said, you know, Dad said, we came from muck! And she said, well, that's true, dear, but he's talking about his side of the family. [LAUGH] But it gets to the issue. I mean, it's pretty funny, I appreciate you laughing, but there's an issue, that, did God put us here? And some people desperately believe that, want to believe it, because it's a segue into afterlife. And all religions want that to be. So, at least all that I know of. So, there's this tension between Intelligent Design and Evolution. And Jay Stephen Gould, a very well known paleontologist, died several years ago. Too young, I think he was only in his 60s. But he was a, made a number of archeological paleontological discoveries that really gained a lot of support for a Theory of Evolution. In fact, she flushed out some of the details. But he proposed, that we leave each other alone. He proposed two non-overlapping Magisteriums, or plural, Magisteria. He said, we've got religion and faith on one side and spirituality. And we've got science on the other side. So folks just leave each other alone. They're non-overlapping. We can be on one side and learn all kinds of things on the other side. We can learn all kinds of things that are scientifically definable. But science lead the realm of religion and spirituality alone and was to other side as well. Well, here's some people who didn't buy that. These are all scientists Daniel Dennett was a philosopher, but he was a pretty good scientist too. He wrote a book, Breaking the Spell, and that's a religious spell. But his biggest argument is that let's, not sit around and talk about this. Let's be reasonable. Richard Dawkins wrote a book The God Delusion. He's a biologist, very well known geneticist. Christopher Hitchens. I don't know, he looks like a drunk there, but he was a, he's a scholar. He died a few years ago of lung cancer, but he was the brute on the side. And he would talk he wrote a book quite well known called God is Not Great. And then Sam Harris who still very active writer, he started it all off by saying the end of faith, that religions are getting us in trouble. Let's just give it up. So here we have scientists intruding into the religious magisteria. And I felt well, that's not good. But there's a comeback here. There's a number of books written about heaven. One of the earliest ones was 90 Minutes in Heaven. By Reverend Don Piper who was in a series accident, went to heaven, came back and I guess made a lot of money. And then, the other one that's really popular, probably sold more copies than any of the others that are there Heaven is for Real, and that's about a kid named Todd Burpo. Written by his father and a ghost writer who does a lot of ghost writing for Christian books. Very popular. In fact, it was recently a movie, made of his life. And so it's not really a comeback, but it's like, hey folks, we still exist. And for Heaven is for Real, millions of copies of that book had been sold. And it's, I guess, comforting to the believers who want to make sure that there is a heaven. And to have people go there and come back and report that, it's very comforting. But then we got this guy, Proof of Heaven, and it's such an engaging topic for many people that it made the front cover of Newsweek. And the cover says, Heaven Is Real. So just relax, folks. Heaven is real. Now what makes proof of heaven such a challenge is, let me give you an anecdote. I was in an airport one time in California, and a woman who I didn't know, but who knew something about me, she said aren't you? Yes, I am. She said, this book proves heaven exists. And why does it prove heaven exists? It's because he's a neurosurgeon. He's a scientist, and we've been trained to believe scientists, and he said that, when he was in a coma, his brain died. He was dead, and he went to heaven and, fortunately, recovered and was able to come back and give his story. So you see what's happening here and that is, since hundreds, tens of thousands of people have had this experience of having a coma and hallucinating basically that they've gone to heaven. But it really matters now that we have a scientist who did that. He went into the muck of the universe and then was lifted out of that into a pure white light, music, and on the wings of a butterfly. Went to heaven and came back with a message. You are loved, you've got nothing to fear, there's nothing you can do wrong, and that was his message. Again, sold really millions of copies of that book, and I went to hear him talk one time. I was invited to engage with him, but that was canceled. There was an audience of 300, 350 people. They just didn't come to hear him. They came really to worship him. To say, here's somebody with scientific credentials who now has seen what we all knew was there. All right, so he came back, and I must point out, however, that there's a book that I would very much recommend to people. It's about this phenomenon, of what occurs in the brain. By Kevin Nelson. He talks about these experiences as being a product of the brain in the borderland between consciousness and unconsciousness. Between dream states and wakefulness, the brainstem that sends these messages kind of gets stuck into this really extraordinary part of the brain between consciousness and unconsciousness. It must also involve the visual cortex because these experiences are so colorful. So I had written a book called Fantasies of Flight several years earlier, and I am able to give a psychological account of what's happening. These other people give physiological accounts, but psychologically. He maps right on to what I talk about in this book, including early separation, which is a very important component of this, separation from a parenting figure. And other matters, so that I understand this kind of from both a psychological and the perspective of the body and the physiology. Now, can we ever be certain about something? Well, I'm pretty convinced that he didn't go there. But does that mean that there's nothing like what's been talked about now, in terms of the extension of consciousness, the survival of consciousness. I don't know. We used to think that this was a science in the early 1800s. This phrenology and the shape of the skull, all bumps here and there, would indicate what talents you had. I have a a bump here, and it is related to, where is it? Disagreeableness. Makes sense. >> [LAUGH] >> Makes sense. And extermination, whatever that means. Folks, be careful, but now we think that is so silly, but it was accepted science at that time. I'm sure people questioned it, but it still went down as science. So Professor Kohls was talking about this in his class one time, and what I was thinking was, science is developing so fast, rapidly, development. What in 50 years, or even 25 years, are we going to look back and say, well, that was silly? What assumptions? How come they didn't know that, yeah, there is consciousness out there somewhere? But right now we don't have that. There's another area. I mean this happens all the time in science. What we thought was true turns out not to be true. We used to think that once we had a right amount of or a full package of neurons in our brains, that was it. Maybe even right after birth, you produced no more. And so I've invited Professor here to tell us that that's not true. Yes. As Professor Oglevee just mentioned. We used to think that the brain made all it's neurons through birth or soon after birth. And after that you didn't really generate any new neurons. We now know that that's not true. That the brain does continue to make new neurons throughout the life span. These nodes are very interesting, because they are also very responsive to our experience. So they respond well to changes in our everyday lives, including how we feel, if we're stressed, if we're anxious, if we're happy, if we're exercising and probably most importantly they respond very well to learning. In fact, if you learn something new and challenging, they can be stimulated to survive. So, even though these neurons exist, and everyone of course is very excited about their evidence that they do exist, we still don't really know what they do. Do they have some particular purpose? Moreover, they don't occur everywhere. So I think sometimes when one fallacy gets overturned. So we thought there were no neurons, now we know that there are neurons. Now we want to use them to explain everything. So now they've been used to explain everything from consciousness to schizophrenia to Alzheimer's disease to basically just anything. So I think the important thing is to always keep our minds open, learn new things. So even in the forefront of this research. Does what this mean is that there's more to know about the brain than we actually know? >> [LAUGH] >> Aren't we finished? Now, we really only got started. >> Okay. >> Contrary to popular belief. >> All right. >> [LAUGH] And I think that's because the brain is a four dimensional structure. We know, like a lot, about the three dimensions of the brain. What it looks like, the structure of it, but it how changes across time is very, very difficult to even comprehend, much less define. >> So thank you Professor Shores. So what currently accepted science based beliefs will we be making fun of in 50 years. So I can't say that there is nothing after, I don't think personally, that there's anything that we're going to be left, about me, once I no longer exist. But I'm not certain, not sure. So with every increase in knowledge, occurs a greater increase in our ignorance. And so I want to give you this final thought. For the entire sequence of courses in various units of Sawood's course. My thought, final thought is the time has come for us to rescue soul and afterlife stories from their historical foundations. And become acutely aware of how they have been and are being exploited for the purpose of social manipulation and social control. It's okay with me for you to have your personal beliefs. And they get you through the day. But when we gather together, and say hey, in our tribes, we're right and they're wrong. That can be used for the purpose of social manipulation, social control, and wrongdoing. Thank you. I hope you enjoyed this unit of the course.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-world-2/lecture/uzCWC/on-to-victory","On to Victory?","[BLANK_AUDIO] Hi. Welcome back. In the presentation today, I'm going to try to zoom in on some choices made, especially in late 1916, about whether to continue the war. When we talk about the continuation of World War I, you see theses nightmarish horrors that are going on in 1914, 15, 16, so how could people continue, how could statesman let their countries go on? Well they made choices; it helps to really try to understand their choices. These were not stupid people, so to understand their choices, as we talked very early on, choices are stories. They're stories in which people confront a Situation; they try to make sense of it; they see their problems there; and they try to figure out what's the best way I can solve these problems. Which then may create a new situation. So, then what we're going to try to do is look at how some of the key players saw the situation by the late summer of 1916, in order to understand why their choices merged together so that this terrible war continued. Let's turn our attention back to the United States of America, led by Woodrow Wilson, and its attitude toward all of this in 1916. One of the first things to understand about Wilson's America is that it was neutral. It was out of the war, and it was doing extremely well as a result. The United States was becoming a supplier mainly to the British and French because the British and French mainly controlled sea lanes and could buy and ship stuff from the United States, and American farmers and merchants were making a huge amount of money out of the war. These were good times for American agriculture. Also Wilson doesn't want America to be involved in the war. And Wilson, the American president, really has a firm grip on controlling American foreign policy. Really to an almost extreme degree, American foreign policy in 1916 was the policy of Woodrow Wilson. Who was Woodrow Wilson? The son of a minister. Former president of a university. A high minded intellectual. But also, a very willful and skillful politician. Forceful orator. What were his positions about the war? First, he was pretty scornful of the great power rivalries that had led these countries into the war. He had no sympathy for what they were trying to achieve and would have been happy if the war had just gone back to the territories and situations that had existed before the war started. He didn't strongly sympathize with one side as being right and another side as being wrong. He wanted America therefore to stay out of the war. [SOUND] But here's the rub. He knew that if the war continued, America was likely to be pulled into it. If he wanted to avoid war, he had to look for ways to stop it. Because as the war escalated, the Germans could not tolerate the United States being the supplier of goods and money to only one side. Nor did Wilson feel the United States could tolerate having its trade cut off by either side. The freedom of America to be allowed to trade with the world was regarded by many Americans as something that was just essential to their prosperity. Here's a wonderful photograph of Woodrow Wilson. We have this kind of caricatured image of him today as this somewhat unworldly idealist. He was indeed quite idealistic, but he was also a highly practical person. So if Wilson wanted to bring the war to an end, did he have any leverage over the combatants? He did. First, he was regarded, with some cause, as being genuinely neutral about which side was right and which side was wrong. And there was a precedent, going back to the Russo-Japanese War, of when another American president, that one Theodore Roosevelt, had actually been called upon to serve as an arbitrator in bringing the war to an end. He had a lot of leverage from the German point of view because if they escalated their submarine attacks, if the US goes to war, that would be bad for the German side. He had a lot of leverage over the British. Not because he was going to declare war on the British. That was inconceivable by this time. The British and the Americans had gone a long way toward making up their differences, especially in the 1890s and early 1900s. The real leverage America had over the British: The U.S. was loaning them the money and selling them the means. And indeed, the U.S. was loaning the British the money that they could use to buy the goods they needed from the United States to continue to wage the war. If the United States threatened to choke off that flow of funds to Great Britain in some way, that would be immediate substantial leverage over the British side. And the British, in turn, were the key financiers of the whole Allied war effort. So, in theory, Wilson had a lot of potential leverage. One problem was: Was the US entering the war scary enough to the German? Because Wilson would not build up the American army. So some German generals discounted how dangerous the Americans might be or thought it would take too long for the Americans to make their presence felt if they got involved in the war. And there was some question as to: Were the Americans really willing to use their theoretical financial leverage against the British? Would they have the nerve to use it against the people who are buying so much of their stuff? In 1916, Wilson's foreign policy situation was this: He tried a peace move in the first half of the year; it had Failed, but it had failed because all of the different sides still had their big war plans to try to win in 1916. They weren't going to be interested in peace until those plans failed. Those plans had not clearly failed until the second half of 1916. Until August or September. Internally though, by August and September, Wilson is running for re-election. That will concentrate his attention. He's in a tough election campaign against the Republican candidate: Charles Evans Hughes. The election will be at the beginning of November 1916. The chronology's important. Now, let's swing our attention to Berlin, and look at how the German leaders analyzed their situation by the late summer of 1916. [NOISE] They are feeling great strain at this point. Tactically, their position is okay. Their armies are, after all, on French and Belgian territory, not on German territory. But strategically, they can't see any clear path to how they win the war. The one panacea they can think of is to rely on submarines to cut the ties of Britain and her allies from the rest of the world. But use the submarines, you bring the United States into war. So, a lot of strain, tactically okay but the overall outlook grim. And as the war goes on, Bethmann increasingly feels like if we go into this all-out submarine warfare, all-out war domestically, I'm going to lose control of the situation. We're going to have to become a different kind of country. The military is going to take over. In effect, Bethmann, the civilian chancellor for the Kaiser thinks: If we don't settle this war pretty soon, it's going to escalate in ways in which it's pretty much going to pass out of my hands, and Germany's going to turn into a military dictatorship dedicated to trying to wage an all-out war. He doesn't want to go there unless he has to, but they have to settle it soon. If they don't get something done soon, then by late 1916 they're going to have to start writing their plans for an all-out submarine attack in 1917 that will bring the United States into the war. So the Germans reach out, looking for urgent US mediation to try to end the war. Let's take a look for instance at some of the interesting telegrams that were exchanged between Bethmann-Hollweg and the German ambassador in Washington. The ambassador for example is pointing out that the Americans do not want to get involved in the war. As the German ambassador observes in the summer of 1916, when all is said and done, the American people are pacifistically inclined. It becomes clearer day by day, how difficult it is to arouse a feeling for preparedness for war, et cetera. Whoever has lived here for a long time cannot avoid the conviction that the Americans' aim in life is the peaceful acquisition of wealth. It is only when he believes that a deep injustice has been done him that he allows himself to be carried along in the current of an hysterical war sentiment. Bethmann-Hollweg's answer. Writing from Berlin in early September 1916, he talks about the situation. The fronts are holding fast, but hope to conclude peace before winter, as the exhaustion of Russia or France by the war is lessened by this development. He's referring to the entry of Romania into the war on the side of the Allies. In case no major catastrophe should occur in the East, would peace mediation by Wilson be possible and successful if we were to guarantee Belgium's unconditional restoration? Otherwise, the unrestricted U-boat war, those are their submarines, U-boats, U-boat war will have to be carried on in dead earnest. Bernstorff believes President Wilson will make a peace move, but he's worried that it may be delayed until after the presidential election. That really worries Bethmann-Hollweg, who writes back to his ambassador that the supreme high command of the army is already looking at the unrestricted U-boat war. That situation would change if President Wilson will make his move. But, some action of this kind must occur before long since we are not in a position to remain quiet any longer. That's in late September of 1916. In other words, they're anxious to end the war quickly before matters escalate in a way that will not only take the war in a new direction but maybe be the end of normal civilian rule in Germany, as the military high command gets its way. Now let's switch the scene to yet one more absolutely key player: the British leadership. The British Government in the summer of 1916 is headed by the last great Liberal prime minister, Herbert Asquith. The war's increasingly overwhelming him as a politician and as a person. As he looks at these issues of war and peace in the late summer of 1916, Asquith and his wife are distraught by the news that their own son has just been killed in France. Britain too is under enormous strain, not clear what else they can do to bring the war to a successful conclusion. The British public through the popular press is getting encouraging news about what's happening in the Battle of the Somme, but little can hide that the front line has not advanced and that the cost is simply terrible. This photograph gives you one illustration of the devastation. As you can see that practically every bit of vegetation has been destroyed. When these shells explode, the metal fragments, the shrapnel, shreds anything that's more than a foot above the ground. Here are some of the walking wounded heading back from the front. In this case, what appears to be a German Prisoner, possibly blinded by poison gas, is being helped back by one of the British wounded. This is part of the debris of war. This is simply used shell casings from some of the artillery that's been firing into the front lines. Asquith makes his move, too. In August 1916, he asks all the leaders of his Cabinet to ponder what the aims would be for a continuation of the war. One answer to Asquith's question comes from the most dynamic politician in his cabinet, a Welshman named David Lloyd George. Here's a photograph of Lloyd George. Lloyd George was a Liberal politician, but He had very much seen himself as a man representing the Welsh miners, representing the working class, a spokesman for social insurance, for government help. When it came to war, Lloyd George presented himself as the dynamic man, the man who could lead Britain to victory. And indeed, Lloyd George begins to see this moment as the one when he will become the war leader. He will become prime minister. He's smart. He doesn't see any panacea for a big breakthrough on the Western Front. He's also highly critical of the quality of British generalship. He has some ideas for using a blockade, for trying to attack Germany and its allies at the margins somehow. But he's determined that Britain just has to continue, and his answer is to go public in September 1916, and tell journalists that what Britain needs to do is to plan on a knockout blow and be willing just to fight it all the way through. He sets himself out to the public as the man who is willing to do whatever is needed. In contrast to Lloyd George, inside the Cabinet discussions, Asquith gets an extraordinary memo from one of the senior statesmen in his government, Lord Lansdowne. Lansdowne has held several of the highest posts the British government can give, even going back to the late 1800s. This elder, conservative statesman, this sober stalwart of British foreign policy, now writes a remarkable secret memo to his Cabinet colleagues. Lansdowne puts his views down in a memo to his colleagues in November 1916. I'm actually reading from the reprinting of this memo in Lloyd George's own memoirs, because Lloyd George regarded what he called this courageous memo, as the key opposing view to the one that he was putting forward. Lansdowne argued: I do not suppose for an instant that there is any weakening in the spirit of the people of this country. And that he hoped that the same might be said of our allies. But neither in their interests nor in ours can it be desirable that the war should be prolonged, unless it can be shown that we can bring it to an effectual conclusion within a reasonable space of time. So, what does the prolongation of the war mean? Our own casualties already amount to over 1.1 million. We've had 15,000 officers killed, not including those who are missing. There's no reason to suppose that as the force at the front and the different theaters of war increases, the casualties will increase at a slower rate. We are slowly but surely killing off the best of the male population of these islands. As for the Allies the total must be appalling. Financial. The financial burden which we have already accumulated is almost incalculable. We're adding to it at the rate of over 5 million pounds per day. Generations will have to come and go before the country recovers from the loss which it has sustained in human beings and from the financial ruin and the destruction of the means of production which are taking place. Fundamentally, Britain is about to go bankrupt. You've seen some of the charts showing the scale of British foreign investment around the world. Britain had been the financial hub of modern capitalism. That era is coming to a close, and Lansdowne is feeling it, because Britain is running out of money. Its public and private finances are strained to the limit. Lansdowne even perceives, presciently, that if the war continues, some of Britain's Allies may themselves implode. Looking over at Russia, and remember this is written in the fall of 1916, he points out that already the domestic situation is far from reassuring. There have been alarming disorders both at Moscow and in Petrograd. If the war continues, Britain will change in some permanent, fundamental way that it can never recover and so might the rest of the world. These are Liberal politicians who are seeing the world they grew up with disappearing before their eyes with the continuation of this war. And they hope to bring it to an end. So look at the way the elements have converged in the late summer and early fall of 1916. [SOUND] The USA needs to bring the war to an end to keep it from engulfing them. And it has leverage over the two sides. The Germans urgently want US mediation, and are, for their own reasons, interested in getting a cessation of hostilities before the end of the year. And the leadership of the British government is clearly looking at all their options. So then. Why did the moment pass? For the USA, Wilson couldn't act quickly because he was consumed by his re-election campaign. Just the timing of the American election cycle. He ends up not making his peace move until December 1916. By that time it's too late. In Germany, they're already moving towards preparing their 1917 war plans. The military will have the upper hand. And in Britain, the advocate of total war, David Lloyd George, had already out maneuvered his opponents in the British Cabinet. Lloyd George's policies are going to drive the British approach. By the end of 1916, when the Americans make their move, German domestic politics, British domestic politics have already closed the window of opportunity. Now I'm spotlighting this moment not because I'm sure there was a panacea here. Maybe if you run a counter-factual experiment, you say: Hmm, there are all sorts of reasons this might not have worked out. Even if the Americans had mediated, it might have failed. And there's no sure thing, especially when you're speculating about might-have-beens. But it does seem to me there is a significant possibility that fruitful negotiations might have happened, given the confluence of positions among these critical countries and the alternative they were looking at. As that windows closed, World War I transitions to a new stage. In the winter of 1916 and 1917, the direction of the war took a dramatic new turn. The leading powers have new people in charge. In Britain, the new prime minister is David Lloyd George, determined to lead the British people to achieve that knockout blow he talked about to the press back in September of 1916, when he'd been outmaneuvering his Liberal rivals for the leadership. Lloyd George forms a national coalition between Liberals and Conservatives, who will join together to win the war at all costs. In France, their leadership too was swept aside the new premier is this man: Georges Clemenceau. Clemenceau was a formidable figure. He comes from what I classify as one of the Liberal parties, in France it would be called the Radical Party. Clemenceau has been a strong advocate of liberty, an opponent of the Church, a fierce spokesman for the underdog. He's a tough fellow. His nickname is: The Tiger (Le Tigre). He'd spent some time in the United States in his younger days, and also had been involved in more than one duel. In Berlin, Bethmann-Hollweg's worst fears come to pass. The German High Command decides it'll adopt its approach to win the war. The key figure in the German General Staff, its military master planner, is this man: Erich von Ludendorff. Ludendorff becomes, in effect, the military ruler of Germany. Bethmann-Hollweg will soon step down from the chancellorship. Ludendorff will really run the day-to-day management of the German Empire. As these new teams move into place in Britain, France, and Germany, Woodrow Wilson, newly re-elected in November and by a very close margin, does make his move to try to end the war. Wilson's peace message of December 1916 calls for a peace without victory. But the moment in which the British and German leaderships would have been open to that kind of move has passed. Now Wilson would have to use a lot of leverage. He actually does pull the British lion's tail a little bit by showing just how vulnerable the British are to American financial pressure. But the American army isn't built up to the point where the German High Command is very frightened of it. Instead, the Germans decide that they're going to undertake their gamble. What is their gamble? The German High Command's theory is this: Yes, the Americans may come into the war if we wage all-out submarine warfare. But we'll starve the British and knock them out of the war before America can slowly build up its army, train its troops, get them to France, and really make their weight felt on the battlefield. And who knows whether the Americans will be that tough an opponent anyway. They aren't used to war like we are. The result, then, is a new phase in the First World War, one that'll push some of the countries over the brink. In one case, in the Russian Empire, the war pushes the government of Tsar Nicholas II over the brink. They simply can't sustain the war effort anymore. The Russian people rise up and overthrow the monarchy. At first it's not clear what's going to happen with Russia's role in the war. This protest, for example, features a banner on the left that simply says: Feed the children of the defenders of the motherland. This banner over here, on the right: Increase payments to the soldiers' families, the defenders of freedom and world peace. They just want a better government. So the Russian Empire, one of the last of the old-style governments, Traditional-style governments, cracks. Another factor that helps create some emotional momentum for war is the Germans, anticipating that America might come in, send to the Mexican government an offer that if the Mexicans will ally themselves with the Germans against the Americans, why, the Germans will help the Mexicans get back all that territory they lost to the United States in the 1840s. Texas, California, and so on. [LAUGH] That German offer to the Mexican government was intercepted by British intelligence, which then finds a way of leaking it without their fingerprints being on it into the American press. You can imagine how the American public reacted to that German move. Even so, it's not a sure thing that America's going to come into the war. A lot still turns on what President Wilson is going to ask. Wilson decides that America does need to come in. Why? He is increasingly convinced that to end the war in the right way offers the only hope to really save civilization, that he needs to join with other countries in doing what America can to make the world safe for a democratic future, and that America wont be able to have any voice on the future shape of the world unless it joins in the war to be able to be at the table and contribute. So, Wilson decides that America has to come in. He asks the Congress to declare war in early April 1917, and the United States, for the first time in its history, joins in a full-scale European conflict. The final phase of World War I and its aftermath will be our topic next week. I'll look forward to seeing you then.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-world-2/lecture/1mJ4S/all-the-plans-fail","All the Plans Fail","Hi, welcome back. In this presentation, I wanted to focus on the first two years of World War I. The basic message is that all the really elaborate plans to win the war are failing. Vast plans moving millions of men, huge amounts of artillery and ammunition, careful railway timetables, comes to bloody wreckage. The war starts out, though, with a great sense of social unity, all those terrible political arguments of the preceding 20 years, management versus working class and so on, now seen replaced by a new kind of unity, as countries rallied to their flags. But the war unfolds in ways that none of the combatants had expected. What did they expect? You might ask. Well, mostly what people expect in the future is things that they know have happened in the past. They tend to predict the future with analogies to the past. If they'd looked at other wars in the past: the Russo-Japanese War lasted about a year and a half to two years; the Franco-Prussian War lasted about a year or so; the Crimean War, again relatively short. No one had any experience in their lifetimes of a large-scale war that lasted year after year after year. It was expected that there would be a violent clash of armies, intense warfare, and a quick outcome. That's not what happened. A key decision at the very outset of the war is: What to do about Belgium? The creation of a neutral Belgium had been a linchpin of European politics ever since the 1830s. France and Germany both had to decide who would enter Belgium to try to gain more advantage from that. Principally, it was the Germans that decided that they would really conduct the invasion of Belgium to get the high ground. Knowing that would surely bring the British in, on the French side. The British decision to join the war, after the invasion of Belgium, it might have happened anyway. It was unlikely the British were just going to let the French be defeated, but the German invasion of Belgium, was the pivot point for the British decision. But the German decision to invade Belgium did not bring them success in the West. Let's look a little bit about, how the initial weeks of the war unfolded. I'm greatly aided here by a wonderful interactive map that's been created by the Public Broadcasting Service, in conjunction with some of their work. Let's zoom in on this interactive map. Step one is the Germans break into the Belgian forts to penetrate into Belgium, in order to wheel down in France. The French are launching their own attacks, against the German frontier. Those attacks collapse in bloody failure. The combatants are discovering that the power of modern weapons, machine guns, artillery, are simply devastating, when men in cavalry stand up and charge out in the open. The German armies in Belgium sweep down from the north, heading toward Paris. A lot of the standard works refer to this German plan, as the so called Schlieffen plan. What the German attack was meant to do was to provide an effective offensive move against France, as France had its own offensive plan against the German frontier. Meanwhile in the East, the Russians launched their attack, by two separate armies, against German East Prussia. But the Germans counterattack and defeat the Russian armies. Back in the West, the French rally a defense near Paris, at what would be called the Battle of the Marne, and the French defeat the overextended German armies, who have now outrun their overextended supply lines, because these modern armies now require huge logistical support. In the next months of 1914, the different sides settle into this line. And this line, will define what was called the Western Front for the next years of war. Failures in the West are accompanied by failures in the East. The Russians launch their offensives here, against East Prussia, here against Austria; they don't get very far. The Serbians drove forward into Bosnia, but there's a counter attack from the Austrians, backed by the Germans, eventually assisted by Bulgarian allies. Serbia itself is occupied by the Central Powers; the battle line by the end of 1915 running down here. By the end of 1914, and into 1915, the war begins widening pretty rapidly. Japan, a treaty ally of the British, join in on the British side. They use this as an opportunity to occupy German territory on the Chinese mainland: the whole Shandong Peninsula and Qingdao. The Japanese also occupied German held islands in the Pacific. Meanwhile, the Ottoman Empire, under the leadership of its Turkish ruler, joins with Germany and Austria and Bulgaria to form a united front. The Ottoman Empire and its Muslim rulers declare a holy war, a jihad, against the British and French and all their positions in the Middle East, and the war quickly extends to a battle for colonies: colonies especially in Africa, where both the British and the Germans mount expeditionary forces to fight wars against each other in the jungles. So, to give you some sense of scale of the war in Europe and Southwest Asia: By the end of 1915, Germany and its allies are dominating this whole area of Central and Southeastern Europe, going on into Southwest Asia, with the Russians and the French, with British help, pushing against them on both sides. And the British now especially involved in battles against the Turks in Asia. With the British reaching out for help from potential local allies, like say the Arabs, the war is widening in other ways, too. In 1915, the combatants begin using the new marvels of chemistry against each other in other ways, releasing many tons of poison gas that, when inhaled, will cause the lungs to inflame and asphyxiate people in the thousands. As all the soldiers begin finding that gas masks are part of their standard kit, the Germans are also advancing in their use of submarines to disrupt world trade and offset some of the British naval advantages. So in early 1915, all the sides had realized that their initial plans at the outbreak of war have not ended the war. And they all start developing their war-winning plans for 1915. Okay, they've learned their lessons, they're going to mount huge offensives on the Western Front to now break through and settle things in France. In the case of the Allies, they develop a big plan to break through that German, Austrian, Bulgarian, Turkish combine by attacking right near Constantinople and putting a huge landing force, especially using Australian and New Zealand troops, to land at a place called Gallipoli, then move from there to threaten Constantinople, knock Turkey out of the war. They've all these elaborate plans. And in the spring and summer of 1915, all of these plans fail, too. The offensives in France collapse into bloody ruin, with the casualties lists beginning to amount into the hundreds of thousands after these weeks of fighting. Both sides now realizing that theyre straining their industry to simply produce enough shells to now wage these sorts of modern battles. Then Gallipoli attack against the Turks encounters a quite modern and very determined Turkish army that kills the Australian, New Zealand, and British Attackers in the tens of thousands and eventually hundreds of thousands of casualties. As the powers on both sides realize that they're involved in a prolonged world war, their war aims evolve, too. Again, think back: What was the war initially about? It was initially about this rivalry in the Balkans. But once these countries were fully at war, once so many of their citizens are fighting and dying on such a colossal scale, well you have to develop war aims that will somehow match. The Allies begin moving toward war aims, that will dismantle the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Dismantle the Ottoman Empire. Germans and their allies developed equally vaulting war aims. They're now developing ambitions that are so radical that each side sees this almost as wars for their future existence. Okay, so they had their big plans in 1915; their plans failed. Well, they're going to learn the lessons of 1915. They're going to develop still better plans for 1916 that fully understand these conditions of modern war. Both sides develop huge elaborate plans for war winning offensives in 1916. In the case of both the Allies and the Germans, their plans center on the Western Front. The Germans plant to launch an offensive at a point the French are going to have to defend. The Germans don't think that winning the territory wins the war. No, they deliberately set out to wage a battle in which they will bleed the French army to death. They'll wage such a war of attrition that the French Nation won't be able to stand to continue the war. They pick as their site for that attack, that blood bath, a place called Verdun. Meanwhile in 1916, they plan to greatly expand submarine warfare, including sinking ships that transit in the Atlantic between Britain and the raw materials in America, in the hope that that will help knock Britain out of the war, as well. The Allies, for their part, are developing huge offensive plans of their own. The British will take the lead, focusing on a place called the Somme. The battle for Verdun begins in February of 1916. It goes on virtually the entire year. The hopes for a bloodbath are realized, but the attrition runs both ways. Enormous losses of life within this relatively tiny place. I've spent some time at Verdun; it's one of the saddest places you can visit on the planet. There are places of the landscape that are so blasted by the fighting, that the vegetation still hasn't recovered to this day. To this day, you can still see the way the earth has been re-molded by the shell fire. You can see the gigantic cemeteries and tombs of the soldiers who died there, under nightmarish conditions. About a million French and German soldiers are consumed in the Verdun maelstrom. The submarine war is effective but not effective enough. The United States, which has stayed out of the war, warns the Germans that, if they sink American shipping and interfere with American trade, the United States will join the war on the side of the British and the French. The Germans hold back. So, the German offensive plans fail. The Allies had their offensive plans, too. The lead part was that the Russians were going to launch a gigantic offensive aimed at knocking the Austrians out of the war. The offensive is very successful; it hits the Austrians very hard, but it ends up hurting the Russian army just as bad. The result: another inconclusive outcome. And as for the offensive on the Somme, one of the most famous disasters of the entire war. The British attackers suffered 60,000 casualties, 20,000 British soldiers killed, just on the very first day of the battle: July 1st, 1916. So in other words, every side has tried its grand bid to win the war, and every side has realized that none of it is working. All the plans have failed. In each of the Allied capitals, especially among the leaders, who have the best information on what's really going on, they can feel the strain now. The losses, the costs, are simply enormous. Their economies, their finances, everything is being strained to the limit. They're all thinking about: Where is this going to go now? How can we win the war? And that creates a really interesting moment, between about August 1916 and January 1917, when a lot of things were possible, a crossroads that we'll discuss in the next presentation.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/soulbeliefs3/lecture/DAKPW/npr-audio-interview-richard-leakey-reflects-on-human-past-and-future","NPR audio interview - Richard Leakey Reflects On Human Past And Future","You're listening to Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. If you've even remotely, if you're ever even remotely interested in anthropology and human origins, chances are you've heard about the name Leakey, a dynasty of fossil hunters in East Africa, of whom my next guest is a member. His father and his mother, Louis and Mary Leakey, contributed volumes to our understanding of human evolution with the fossils they uncovered at the old [INAUDIBLE] gorge. Along with Mary Leakey's later discovery of a long trail of footprints left by fatal hominids 3.5 million years ago in Tanzania. My next guest added to the human family tree with many finds of his own including the nearly complete skeleton of Turkana Boy a homoerectus youth. He also has served as the head of the Kenya Wildlife Service in his time there, sparing many elephants and rhinos from being poached for their ivory. And he spent a fair amount of time in Kenyan politics too. So he's sort of led three different lives and he's here with us to talk about it. Richard Leakey is founder of the Turkana Base and Institute in Kenya where he lives, he's a professor at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York and he's here in our New York studios. It's my pleasure to welcome you to Science Friday. >> Thank you very much. >> Thank you for being here. What does it mean to be a Leakey? Is that, is that a name that's been, you know, something you've had to explain over the years or people know who you are? >> Well that's a difficult question to answer. I think there's an awful lot of privilege associated with it, but like anyone who is known, it carries a certain weight with it. And one has to be careful what one says, and where one goes, and what one does once you get that sort of notoriety, but it does carry a lot of privilege and it's great fun, particularly earlier on in life, to be recognized. >> I'll bet, I have to tell you, or share a story with you. Your father was the first brand name, I'll say, big name scientist I ever interviewed, 40 years ago. >> Really? >> I was at a AAAS meeting in Philadelphia. It's around Christmas time in 1971. And he was giving a talk there. And I found myself in the press room absolutely alone with him. And I knew who he was. Like we were alone here in a studio. And I'm saying to myself, this is Louie Leakey. I mean, I'm gonna, he's standing right next to me. What can I ask him that won't make me sound like, I'm 22 years old, I won't sound really stupid, you know? I saw all those National Geographic Films and everything else on TV, and I finally said Dr. Leakey, what is it that sets humans apart from the apes? His eyes lit up, it's one of his favorite subjects to talk about. Started to talk about precision grip and things like that. >> Well he liked young people. >> I'm glad he did! [LAUGH] >> He loved young people who were interested in what he did so you were alone with the right person. >> [LAUGH] Yeah, I was. Now I'm here with you over 40 years later. Tell us what it's like to be out there. One of the things we try to ask scientists is to describe for our audience, what's it like to do what they do. What's it like to be out there, looking for fossils? >> Well I think, like in any branch of science, much of what you do is drudgery, much of it isn't exciting. Much of it is based on one's own conviction that with time youre going to get the answer that you're looking for. So they're not really very many days when you feel youre wasting your time. You just feel frustrated that you havent got what youre looking for. Many of the fossils that I have been associated with finding, been found in very remote parts of Kenya, of very desolate, hot, dry desert areas. I've built up a personal love for the desert and fascination. But looking for human fossils is only part of the story. They're usually part of a extinct fauna in the world. Fossils of other creatures that lived in the same environments. It's really like visiting a new zoo everyday. You go out you find things that you haven't seen before. You're intellectually peaked practically through out the day and so there's nothing In a day that doesn't give you some form of satisfaction even though it may be tough. But, it's an enormously privileged activity to go out and look for things that, if you find them, may change the course of understanding of humanity. >> 1-800-989-8255 is our number, if you'd like to talk to Richard Leakey. But it must be, you say it gives you satisfaction, but it must be incredibly frustrating knowing it could take you years. Took your father decades to find what he was looking for and then your mom found it. >> Well I think frustration is the wrong word. >> Okay. >> I think that I have been very fortunate in my career in that when I went up to Lake Turkana in northern Kenya, turned out to be there were so many fossils that one really had very little of the difficulties that my parents experienced. 40 years later there are far fewer fossils to be found because they've largely been collected. But there are very specific questions and over the last five years, my wife Meave and daughter have been focusing on very specific things they're looking for. And they've zeroed into particular time bands represented in the geology. And they have spent days and days looking specifically for fossils in that particular time zone. They have been rewarded. They have found them. But that is a much more diligent task than simply the exploration I was privileged to have fun doing. >> And what are they looking for, at this point? >> Well they were, last few years, they've been looking for the origin of homo, and trying to find out what more complete specimens would have looked like that relate to the homo habilis story that my parents worked on and maybe look into the whole question of the ancestry of homo and whether homo habilis, which comes before homo erectus, really is distinctive from some of the things that have been called homo habilis but are not. It all gets very technical. But one of the problems with paleoanthropology is that although there's a remarkable story, much of the story is still represented by frustratingly fragmentary evidence and so more has to be found to tie up a few loose ends. But it's so much further along than it used to be even 20 years ago. >> So when you find a fossil, what do you see in these old bones that can tell you whether or not something was our ancestor? >> Well, I guess it's like it's harder today in America where you use paper cups and paper plates. But if you think of your grandparent's cutlery and crockery, if you break up a series of plates of different kinds and different sources and you mix it up with the dirt, and you've studied plates and crockery, when you pick something up, you can say. >> This is the edge of a plate that was probably used for soup, and this was a plate that was probably used for dessert, and this was a piece of a plate that was probably a serving plate. Just from its shape, thickness, and design. If you're familiar with anatomy and you're familiar with the anatomy of fossils that have been found previously, it's relatively easy to categorize what you're finding quite quickly into a broad set of characters. Then, clearly you have the problems of you haven't found enough of the specimen, what it actually compares to, but you can look on the specimen, see if it's got any evidence of being recently broken. You then determine whether to excavate, whether to screen the area, and you can gradually build up a picture. It's like when we found the Turkana Boy. I didn't find Find it, but Kamoya, one of my assistants, discovered a little piece of skull. It was clearly a little piece of a hominid skull. But whether it was going to lead to anything, I didn't know. In these cases, you always look further. Within a few days we'd found enough of the skull, to know that the front of the skull was represented with a fragment. The back of the skull was represented with a fragment. And so, presumably, the middle of the skull was, too. So we had to then start a much more extensive excavation. And we started to find bits of ribs. Well, skull and ribs mean there's probably something connecting them. And it was then we found that we had an almost complete skeleton. But that took three months to uncover. >> Yeah. And, actually, are you down with the toothbrush, and a pick, and- >> I was, then, yes. >> Yes. >> It was enormously exciting, because every day, practically, for the first six weeks. We were finding things that have never been seen before by modern humans. And we were the first to see them, and realize that we had things in our hands that were going to answer questions that people had been worrying about. For years. >> So you must keep these very secret when you find these spots. I would imagine. You don't want somebody else coming by [CROSSTALK] >> No, no, no, no one doesn't suffer from that. [LAUGH] It's no problem at all. >> [CROSSTALK] Yeah, I've seen it. >> People can work anywhere in Kenya if they get the right permits. >> But if you've got, you're there all day and you're eager to get back the next day to keep digging up something- >> Well these are pretty remote areas. I mean, the worry is sometimes when you preserve a bone with a preservative. And in the night a hyena will come along, and like the taste of the glue and chew it. >> So you hate it when that happens. >> Well worse than hate. Much worse than hate. >> Does that happen often that kind of thing? >> We never lost a human fossil, but we lost some wonderful other creatures fossils that had been left over night. To dry from the hardener, and in the morning there's just been a crumpled wreck. When hyenas chewed on it to get what it thought might be good tasting. After three million years it chews up a skeleton. >> Yeah, you've exposed it for him and he's taken it away. >> Very irritating. >> Yeah. Talking with Richard Leakey. I know that you've had a few scientific feuds in your life. Notably, with Donald Johanson over the discovery of Lucy. You don't think Lucy was an ancestor? Would I be summing that up correctly? You don't think that Lucy was ancestral to Homo? >> Well, we had a big sort of, discussion. >> Frank exchange of views, as they say in Washington. >> Frank exchange of views, yes. Back in the mid 70's. And I felt then that the story was probably a little more complex than was being presented. I confess that I was largely acting on hunch. We had a few fossils, but they were not particularly convincing. And we disagreed, and chose to disagree, over what this represented. But I think over the last 25, 30 years. So much more material has come in, that the picture is much clearer. It's perhaps fortunate that over the last 30 years, I have been focusing more on consolation, and more on politics. I haven't kept abreast of some of the discoveries. But certainly at 3 million years, there is more than one candidate for homo ancestry. I think that's probably the best way to leave it at the moment. >> Yeah, you know a lot of Creationists do not believe in human evolution. They liked to say that no human has descended from a monkey, or an ape, or a chimpanzee, and that's exactly correct, isn't it? It's not that we were descendants from them, but there's common ancestries. >> Well indeed, and I think if we were very fair. Which humans aren't. And one did have the classifications of primates done by a non-primate. There would be six great apes, and not five because we are just an ape. We just happen to be the more intelligent one, and did the classification ourselves. I think this added to the whole idea that god created us in his image. Makes changing our image very difficult for people intellectually. And I think that's truly what it's about. And I'm quite sure, had Charles Darwin not suggested that we too had evolved. Evolution would have been perfectly acceptable to everybody. But it wasn't thus. And all the evidence today, and there's abundant evidence, and very clear evidence, is that we have evolved. And, if you go back far enough, our ancestors don't look anything like we do today. But people didn't like the idea that the world wasn't the center of the universe. People didn't like the idea that the world wasn't flat. Given time and evidence people learned to accept these things if they're true. And I think there's no question of the truth of human evolution, none at all. >> 1-800-989-8255. You're listening to Science Friday on NPR. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Richard Leakey. Let's see if we can get a few phone calls in here. Let's go to this line, let's go to Anne in Adrian, Michigan. Hi, Anne. >> Hey, Ira, how are you? >> Hey there! >> Good, I just want to say hello to Richard. Richard, it's Ann Cooksey Sherman. >> Hi, Ann. How are you? You used to work with my mother. >> [LAUGH] >> And you worked with me. And you were there when Turkana Boy was found. >> That's right, and I also worked for years with Mary, of course. >> Indeed. Well, nice to hear from you. >> Yes. >> See, we bring people together on this- >> [LAUGH] Thank you, Ira. >> Send me a note. >> What's up? >> Send me a note so I know where you are. >> And I want embarrass Richard now. I want you to tell me a really good story about him that no one knows. >> Well let's see. According to his mother, I saved his life once. I was studying to become a nurse at the time, and was working and visiting Turkana. He was very, very ill. Couldn't keep anything down, and I had some codeine tablets. And I gave him a couple of those. And before too long, you were feeling better weren't you? >> Well, I didn't know my mother told you. I told you that you saved my life. And I'm forever grateful, Ann. And you know that. [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH] Oh, your mother said she was very against me becoming a nurse. And so she said I'll never complain again. >> Maybe we should leave storytelling there. [LAUGH] >> All right. >> [LAUGH] Thank you Ira. >> Thank you Ann, thanks for calling. We never know who's gonna call in on this show. >> Well that's a pleasure. >> That is, that is a pleasure. 1-800-989-8255. Before we go to the break, tell us a little bit about your change of career. Why you left the fossil hunting business, if I call it a business. And went on to other things. >> Well I was running a museum, a natural history museum. Fossil hunting was a part time activity. The museum had grown into a bit of a beaurocracy. I had about 600 staff. I was attending meeting after meeting with government officials. Spending half my life raising money for things that were perhaps important, but didn't seem that important at the time. In this sort of run of important things in Kenya. And I was probably a little bored. And I thought it'd be more fun to look for something else to do. And the President of Kenya offered me the chance to train a new wildlife organization. And take over the management of wildlife conservation in Kenya. Which at the time was in very bad shape. And I thought that would be a good challenge, and so I took it on. >> How long did you do that for? >> For an initial four and a half years. And then I fell out with the government, and the president. Over matters concerning corruption, and their unwillingness to help me deal with corruption that was effecting what I was doing. So I decided to go into opposition politics, and fight corruption. And I formed a new political party in opposition to the government. Ended up in parliament, and got reasonably bored with that after awhile. >> [LAUGH] We have a scientist who we follow, who started as science and went into congress. And he said the difference between science and congress is that In science, facts mean everything and illusions mean nothing. And in politics, it's just the opposite. >> I think that's very fair and then I went from that to head the Kenyan government's civil service and sit through the cabinet. And there it's a good cross between science and politics. And you're very selective of what you want to believe and what you don't. And facts don't play that much in valuing your judgments. >> Do you find more scientists in politics over there in Kenya? >> Very few. But there are very few scientists in Africa. Science education has been sadly neglected for far too long. >> Is that your next mission, to help science education programs? >> Yes, it is. And that's why I have the strong association with Stony Brook and why we've developed the Turkana Basin Institute through Stony Brook, to try and develop the opportunities for science education, particularly in paleoanthropology and geology and related sciences. >> All right, we're gonna take a break and come back and talk lots more with Richard Leakey. Our number 1-800-989-8255. He is founder of the Turkana Basin Institute in Kenya, where he lives, and professor at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York. Our number, as I say, 1-800-989-8255. You can tweet us @scifri, at S-C-I-F-R-I. Go to our Facebook site /scifri and get in on the discussion going there and maybe do some questions and answers for Richard Leakey there too. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this break. You're listening to Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about hominids and human origins this hour with my guest Richard Leakey, founder of the Turkana Basin Institute in Kenya, and a professor at Stony Brook University, in Stony Brook, New York. And I'd like to bring on another guest now to talk about evolution. And this was the evolution of language, because just like species, languages evolve. They pick up new words and new rules and eventually languages diverge from each other to the point where they can no longer communicate. People speaking different languages. In a recent count of the world's languages, that number has hit nearly 7,000, 7,000 different languages. But did language originate only once? Was there an original language before branching off into all of those modern varieties? If so, where did it originate, and when? These are some of the questions addressed in my next guest's study, out in the journal Science this week. Quentin Atkinson is a senior lecturer in the department of psychology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, and he joins us by phone. Thanks for getting up early this morning, Dr. Atkinson. >> You're welcome. >> Tell us about the study. The idea is that you were able to track the origins of all language to one spot? >> Yeah. So my background's in evolutionary biology and so the approach I took was really a similar approach to what population geneticists have done to look at our genetic origins and trace that back to Africa. So one of the key lines of evidence there is that genetic diversity is highest in Africa and decreases as you go out further from Africa. And that sets with a model called the Serial Founder Effect, where an ancestral population will have a lot of diversity and then, as you go out from that during an expansion, populations will break off and take a subset of the diversity with them. If that happens over and over again, then the further you get from the origin, the less genetic diversity you expect. >> Well, in genes we track the genes backwards. What do we track backwards, what are the building blocks in languages that we're looking to track? >> Right, well, one of the fundamental, or perhaps the fundamental unit of language is the phoneme, the smallest unit of sound that we use to differentiate meanings. So the word cat and the word bat are differentiated by the k and b sound, so that's a phoneme. And what I was interested in doing was looking at these phonemes all around the world to see if the geographic distribution could be used in a similar way to the way geneticists have looked at genetic diversity. >> Mm-hm. >> So I was looking at the number of phonemes in different languages. And there's good reasons, a priori reasons, why we might expect phonemes to show a similar kind of founder effect to what we see in genetics. Smaller populations of speakers are known to have fewer phonemes. And also, theoretical models of language learning and computer simulation predict that smaller populations should lose phonemes. So based on that theory and background, I decided to go to the data, to a dataset of over 500 languages around the world, where we had information on the number of phonemes in the different languages. And put them on a map and then get a computer algorithm to go through a whole lot of potential origin locations around the world, and ask where do we see, if anywhere, a gradient of decreasing diversity from some potential origin? And if you can choose any origin what would be the best one to fit that pattern? And it turned out that Africa had the highest diversity and showed the best fit with this model, much better than anywhere else, which, of course, fits with the genetic picture. >> Interesting. Let's see if we can give our audience a little taste of how diversity starts being very diverse and then sort of culls down. We have an example of first the Nama from Namibia in Africa. Let's listen to that. >> [FOREIGN] >> And so there are a lot of phonemes in that one. >> Mm, yeah, incredibly diverse. And a lot of clicks that you would have heard as well, which is something that they're not really used much outside of Africa. >> Okay, so let's go outside of Africa and go to a second example, of the Hawaiian language. >> [FOREIGN] >> And a difference there. >> Yeah, so you might have heard, well, far fewer sounds, but also one of the ways that meaning's encoded when you have fewer sounds is you tend to repeat the sounds you've got over and over again. >> Now that you say you're pointing to Africa as the origin of language, can you tell from your study when the language evolved? >> That's a good question. The method I've used is looking just at the geographic trends and can't date the origin independently. But looking at that pattern, you obviously wanna find an explanation for it. And it seems like the clearest explanation is that language would've spread with our genes when we expanded from Africa, which we can date through looking at gene trees in human species and also through the archaeological record to 50 to 70,000 years ago when we started to expand from Africa. >> And did the evolution of language influence the evolution of our species, do you think? >> Well, I think I think it could have been incredibly important. The advantages conferred by being able to communicate complex information. I think maybe would have been most useful for allowing groups of humans to coordinate and cooperate. >> Mm-hm. >> And could've given us a real competitive advantage over other dominant species at the time. So in the paper, I suggest that language could've been one of the catalysts for that expansion from Africa. >> I'm gonna ask Richard Leakey who is sitting here with us, to comment. Do you think language is, was important? >> Yes I do. I think this work that's just been published by Dr. Atkinson in phenomenally important. And one of the big mysteries to me, and to many of us. Has been why the last great expansion to which we can all directly relate. And if you look at the the unraveling of the genome. When you look at the genetics of modern humans. Clearly, we have a point of origin between 60 and 70,000 years ago. And yet, anatomically and archaeologically, nothing that really explains any dramatic change. And I have long postulated, as have others. That it's perhaps language that you wouldn't find anatomical evidence for. That might have given the advantage to that population of homosapiens. That basically out competed every previous population of homosapiens that had all ready spread over much of the old world. And I think the fact that this correlates more or less. It really is very exciting. And I think that we're beginning to see a picture emerge that is consistent, and understandable. What we've now got to do is find a lot more evidence of the fossils themselves in the archaeology itself. And, that Turkana Basin Institute, which we've set up in Northern Kenya. Is probably fairly close. I mean, could be hundreds of miles from the epicenter. But there's an enormous range of deposits that carry evidence from about 10,000 years to back, to about 100,000 years. And I think we will find the fossil remains, and the archaeological remains, that cover this period. And if we get enough good material, maybe all this will come together in the next decade. And we'll finally understand what we are, and when we came. >> What do you think Doctor Atkinson? >> Well yeah, I think it would be great if we could synthesize some early archeological, and paleontological evidence. With the kind of echos of it we see in cultural diversity today. And really kind of tell the cultural story alongside the genetic story. >> We usually don't think about linguists handling these language questions. We usually think that that's what they do, they compare languages and so on. But you're now getting picked up by evolutionary biologists, like yourself, is this whole idea. It's interesting to see how this has evolved, so to speak. >> Yeah, well, those parallels between the evolution of language, and change in species that you mentioned at the start, at the introduction. Mean I think that linguists and evolutionary biologists are often asking the same kind of questions of their data. And so can use similar methods to answer them. And I guess that's how I've ended up with this paper. >> Well, we want to thank you. Wish you luck and thank you for taking time to be with us today. >> Thank you. >> You're welcome. Quintin Atkinson is a senior lecturer in the Department of Psychology, at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Stay with us here as Richard Leakey. Founder of the Turkana Basin Institute. And Professor at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, NY. Our number's 1-800-989-8255. Let's see if we can get a lot of people with lots of interesting questions. Let's go to them right now. Let's go to Larry in Sheridan, OR. Hi, Larry. >> Hello and thank you for taking my call. >> Youre welcome. >> Question Ive always wondered, is as you look at a modern population of living beings. And you look at the extreme variation say in skull size or shape and as well as height and all that. How many specimens do you need to find of the same age, to determine that youve indeed found a definitive stage of development? Is it 10? Is it 50? 100? Or do you just find one skull and say hey, here's a- >> Well let's turn it into a different sort of question on the same issue. If you look at domestic animals. And I think humans are a domestic animal, and have been since we got, developed a strong culture and different behavior patterns associated with being a cultural animal. But let's leave humans aside for a minute, and go to the plains of Africa. The national parks of Africa, or North America, or Europe. If you get a brown bear skeleton, or you pick up a mandible, or lower jaw, or a femur of a brown bear. It is going to be a brown bear, and no anatomist is gonna to tell you it could be anything else. The remarkable uniformity between the anatomy of different species. Is striking, even for the poorly informed. And, so when you find a fossil that's two million years old, the chances of it being abnormal and not characteristic. Are very, very remote indeed. So I think when you find several skulls that are almost identical to each other. And at more or less at the same point in time. The chances of this not being representative of that species, at that time are simply discountable. I don't think you should be diverted by that. And I think the difficulty is to pick up a Pekingese skull, and compare it to the Great Dane, and the domestic dogs. And say well, these clearly are different species. Yet you know perfectly well they're not different species. They're simply being bred by the human culture. And I think take modern humans out of the story for the moment, and look at wild animals. And you'll find that these pre-cultural hominids were behaving just as wild creatures do today. And every fossil you find is going to be distinctive, and diagnostic of the species from which it's coming. >> Talking with Richard Leakey on Science Friday from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow. In the few minutes we have left, I wanna give you my blank check question I give to scientists sometimes. And they start drooling early when I mention that. And that is, if you had all the money in the world, and all the resources. What would you do? What question would you like to answer, and how would you go about spending that money to find it? >> Well, I funnily enough, I think this conversation has pointed to an area that I think is now absolutely critical. I think for a long time we in paleoanthropology have tried to persuade people of our evolution. And we've started at the wrong end. We've been looking for the oldest fossils which are least like us. And people have had an easy time discounting them and saying, no, that's an ape. I think we need to turn it round and start with us and look at the genetic story. Look now at the language story, and then look at the fossil story. And you will We'll find fossils at 30, 40,000 years. That are identical to the skeletons of the two of us sitting here, and everybody listening to us. You then go back in time. And I think if we had started that way at the beginning, we'd have gone a lot further with dealing with acceptance of human evolution. I personally believe that if we could accept human evolution and evolution, science would be much more acceptable. And, I think the only way out of the mess this species is in today, is for science to get greater currency value in the world. And I think a lot of biological natural science has been discounted because of the fear of evolution. Evolution is nothing to be afraid of. And if we could get a lot of money, and a lot of attention. And look at the last 100,000 years. Which I think we can do now. I think we could clear this up once and for all. And it's late but there's still time. >> Are you saying it's a world wide fear of evolution? Or is it mostly in the United States? >> I think it's growing. I think it is worldwide. I think it's much more the case in areas where Christianity and Islam have had a lot of influence and I think the fundamentalist approach to religion that you're seeing both in those two great religions, it's making this worse. But you find it in Europe, you find it in England, you find it Africa. In fact, there are very few African leaders who believe in human evolution and science. >> Is that right? >> And it's very, very worrying because Africa's problems will only be resolved by African scientists working on these bones. And if we don't teach science from early on, we're not gonna get out of this hole, because nobody's gonna pull us out of the hole because they're in one themselves. >> Does it make it hard to excavate in these African countries if they don't believe? >> Funny enough it doesn't, because if they don't believe we're looking for human ancestors they don't care what you're doing. >> What an interesting answer. [LAUGH] You could be digging on the moon. >> Exactly, for something else. >> Whatever you find is not gonna prove what you think it's gonna prove. >> That's exactly the attitude, and so thus far it's been beneficial, if you like. >> And what about the disruptions in the world that are going on now, the wars and things like that, the famines. Is global warming going to affect anything? >> I think global warming's going to have a huge impact. It's like evolution. I think that if we could accept that there is evidence for climate change, forget who caused it. Let's not worry about that. But let's look at the prehistoric record. And recognize that climate change has happened before, and it's because it's happened before, we know the scale of possibilities. And the change that we're looking at is not unlike changes we've had before. The difference is, we're now 8 billion people, before there were less than a million. This is going to impact. Rising sea levels today will be a very different impact to rising sea levels 500,000 years ago. >> So if you look back in time, you can see what a tremendous influence it will have on human society, and appreciate what might happen now even more. >> Appreciate what'll happen now is very clear if you look at the past record. And when homo sapiens appeared between 50 and 70,000 years ago, Lake Tacoma where I work rose 70 meters. >> 17? >> Seven zero meters. >> Seven zero meters, wow. >> In a moment. >> Wow. Wow, can't end in a better place than that. Thank you, Richard Leakey, founder of the Turkana Basin in Kenya and Professor at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook. Thank you very much for taking time. >> Thank you. >> I know how difficult it is for you to get here and thank you very much for being here today. That's about all the time we have for today.

"https://www.coursera.org/learn/soulbeliefs3/lecture/oU6nS/the-evolution-of-the-human-brain-part-c","The Evolution of the Human Brain Part C","The human can do some remarkable things, and what we're going to see is a brief video on a volunteer person who put on goggles that turned the whole world upside down, and let's see how she responded to that. [MUSIC] >> For another clue to the brain's remarkable adaptability, consider Susanna Fines, a London art student who has agreed to undergo a curious experience. In order to appreciate this, we need to review how the visual mechanism operates in our normal everyday encounters. For example, when an object appears in our visual world, the image passes through the lens of the eye and in that process, it is inverted on to the retina. The image is then passed along the visual pathway to the visual cortex at the back of the brain, where it is perceived as being right side up. >> If I could have a look at these most unusual spectacles on you. >> For one whole week, she will see the world upside down, inverting once again, what the lens and the eye does anyway. Our brains correct for this inversion. Now hers will be forced to make yet another correction. Will she be able to make sense of an upside down world? >> [INAUDIBLE] God, that's really weird. I'm sure I'm holding the cup up. >> At home, an hour later, the world is still bewildering. >> Got it. It's funny, I just suddenly do it. [SOUND] Lost it again. Oh, yeah. Extraordinary. >> On the third day, Susannah tries to write her name without looking. [INAUDIBLE] trying to stop. It seemed worse and worse, I could read that end but not the rest of it. Shall I try and write it? Now, if I can draw. >> Once she looks, she is able to invert the letters completely. Clearly, in three days, she's made progress integrating upside down seeing with upside down moving. >> There now, I can read that quite easy. >> On Susannah's final day, she tries to draw. With a week's practice, she can now sign her name to the drawing right side up while looking. The seeing part of Susannah's very flexible brain has somehow matched the unchanged world to her altered vision. >> All right, I've been wearing them for a week, I'm going to take them off and try and walk across the room. I don't dare do it. This is terrifying. Oh, goodness! It's red, surely. That is just so incredible. I just feel everything all around me, it's amazing. >> And now, Susannah Fine's brain has managed yet another inversion of the image. >> An extraordinary feeling. >> And this time, it's taken just one hour. >> And then suddenly, I just feel as though nothing ever happened, if you look around. >> [SOUND] >> Everything just seems completely normal again. [SOUND] >> This basic pathway of vision is therefore flexible, plastic. It's ready to help us adapt to a world that changes. >> Now you didn't need me to tell you that our brain is better than a chicken's brain but this is amazing, to have one creature that just cannot adapt to some simple change in its visual world, and humans who can switch back and forth from upside down back to where they were before and do all kinds of complicated things. Now what that means is that the whole evolutionary process has pushed the processing and the plasticity back into the brain. So, our visual system, the eye part of it is pretty complicated but compared to what we do with our visual system, it's just the tip of the iceberg. Most of our seeing and visual processing has just taken the basic raw information and pushed it back into the big computer where it can make all these adjustments as we go though a changing world. Okay, so let's step away from that theme for a moment and go to childhood and ask whether the human childhood is special in any way. Again, I think the answer is yes. The data support that. Certainly, nearly all of our cultures think childhood is important. Poets think childhood is important. The childhood shows the man as morning shows the day. 'Tis education forms the common mind. Just as the twig is bent, the tree's inclined. The child is the father of the man. All different ways of expressing the idea that our childhood is a very important part of our life cycle. I'm going to talk to you about three evolutionary advances that are related to this. One of them, a longer lifespan, the other, neoteny. And the final one, the importance of a very long childhood. Before we move on to the next slide, I want to make sure that you understand the term lifespan. It is different than life expectancy. Our life expectancy now is somewhere in the 70s. At the time our Constitution was being written, life expectancy was probably somewhere in the 50s. Back in the Middle Ages in certain parts of the world it was probably, down in the 20s and 30s. Yet, in each of these historical periods, where life expectancy was very different, lifespan remained constant because there were always people who would live to about 100 years of age always. No matter what the life expectancy is because some of them just basically, dodged all the bullets. The lifespan of the white-tailed deer is somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 to 12 years. The life expectancy of the white-tailed deer in New Jersey is about 18 months. They are really bad at crossing the street. So, let's look at lifespan. A few years ago, my daughter got married, and her now husband gave her a diamond as an engagement symbol because diamonds last forever. I don't know how strong the relationship would have been if he had given her a hamster, instead of a diamond- >> [LAUGH] >> Or a gerbil because they don't last very long. >> [COUGH] >> They don't last very long. So- >> [COUGH] >> You see a gerbil, their lifespan is about three years. A cat, about ten years, sometimes more. Elephant 75 years, a whale 200 years, and biologists have been kind of interested in that, trying to come up with some sort of a reason for it. And one reason that seems to work fairly well, lot of variability, but it works fairly well, is heartbeats. And mammals live for approximately, 800 million heartbeats. So, if you take your little gerbil, and hold it up to your ear to listen to its heartbeat, he's probably going to bite your ear, but you're not going to be able to count his heartbeats, anyway, because it's going to be turning along at 8, or 10, or 12 beats per second, faster than you can count. Cat, heartbeat going faster than yours, but not nearly as fast as a gerbil. Elephant has a very slow heartbeat, and if you want to listen to the heartbeat of a whale, it might take a little patience because it's going to be going lub Dub. >> [LAUGH] >> It takes a long time to reach 800 million. And probably, make a pretty good engagement gift. You'd need a large apartment. So, you might want to get on a spreadsheet, or something and figure out, how long it takes you to reach your 800 million heartbeats. Something on the order of maybe, 70 per minute, 60 minutes per hour, and so on and so forth. You can do that calculation. You might want to sit down, when you get to that final number, because I hate to tell you this, you're almost there. You will reach your 800 million about the same time you graduate from Rutgers. It's about 22 years, yikes. For reasons that still remain unknown, we end up having a lifespan about three times longer, so when you draw that chart of a whole bunch of different mammals, and how many heartbeats they tend to live. It's a pretty variable graph, but even with that variability, humans are off the chart. For some reason or other, we are given a good bit more time, a good bit more heartbeats for our lifespan. Eubie Blake, once said, on his 100th birthday that if I had known I was going to live so long, I would have taken better care of myself. That we do have the ability to live for a long, long time, and there may be some evolutionary reasons why that works. Let's look a little bit at childhood, is that the beginning of each of these lifespans. There got some yearlings being show there. A horse that's a year old, galloping around the paddock. A dog that's a year old, looks a lot like an adult dog, but still has a kind of youthful appearance, can do all sorts of complicated dog-like things. There's a little chimpanzee there, swinging on a rope in a zoo from one rope to another. A moose, it's a year old, wading out into the lake to eat something of the bottom of the lake. Little year old lion there, sleeping, having a little nap on the rock. But still, a magnificent creature, if you were to wake him up would be able to do all sorts of abilities, even though technically it's a cat. And then There's humans. Happens to be my granddaughter. Oh, she's as smart as she is cute, but at one year old, pretty much just sat around, and about a month later started taking a few steps and walking, like a all year olds tend to do. Pretty pathetic compared to all of these other creatures. >> [LAUGH] >> So, we're off to a very, very slow start. With our childhood, just from a purely physical standpoint. You all kind of reacted to these creatures, especially the little one, oh, cute. Well, that gets us to neoteny. Even these little line drawings here, you probably would all agree that they're cute. We've got the cute little person there, cute little bunny rabbit, and the puppy, and even the little bird is kind of cute and psychologists are never happy just with a report from people that oh, yeah these things are cute. We want to know why, we want to measure it, we want to have it be replicable, we want to make science of it, and it turns out that was pretty easy to do. Just show a whole bunch of people all kinds of line drawings that differ in one dimension or the other, run the results through a computer and you can find out that cuteness has three main variables. One of them, a round head, tends to be somewhat spherical. Big eyes. Now, actually, the eyes are not big. It's just that, because of some of the detailed structure of the eyes, the eyes of infants tend to be about the same size they're going to be in adulthood. Relatively speaking, they're large compared to the remainder of the head and a receding chin, it's not so much that it's receding as it's not yet protruding and those three things make up cuteness. That's in childhood early development of all of these creatures and it's pretty common across most of the species that we're familiar with but then something happens as we age. Not so cute anymore because the head is not as round, and the eyes have gotten smaller relative to the head and the chin has grown up. Look at what happens to our close relatives, here. The infant on the left and I do not know if that is mom or dad on the right but lots of cuteness has been lost from childhood into adulthood. We can measure how much cuteness was lost because we have a mathematical formula for it and what we find is that some creatures differ in terms of how much cuteness they lose and humans remain cuter in adulthood than these other creatures. Mathematically proven, we remain cuter, even in the most challenging cases. >> [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH] We remain cuter and it's not really just that we think we remain cuter, we've got the math to prove it. And that's called neoteny. >> It's the progressive maintenance of child-like, call that cute, child-like features into adulthood. So we look more like babies in adulthood, than other creatures do, is that important? Well, it probably is. If you're walking across campus and see a dog running across the street in front of a campus bus, if it's a little puppy, you will probably foolishly go running out and try to snatch it from in front of that bus. If it's some old dog with its jaw protruding and its beady little eyes, and its non round head, you'll say, well, I hope he makes it but I'm not going to run out there. We tend to be more nurturing and helpful and nice to cute creatures and that probably contributes to human's ability to be social creatures and live in tribes and things like that. Now, obviously, it doesn't always work. One can only imagine how vicious the human race would be if we weren't cute to have something to mute it down a little bit. We're plenty willing to maim and kill our fellow humans, as it is but cuteness plays a role in the way we interact, and just think about some of the language that goes into romantic situations. Full grown adults call each other baby, and it's kind of sickening. >> [LAUGH] >> But it all feeds into this neoteny thing. So now, start to think about what we've got here. We've got the brain doing the bulk of the processing of our information. We have, for reasons unknown, a very long period of time to live. We have a very slow and long childhood that may go on for as long as 30 years. Seriously, a 30 year childhood? Most of our other mammals are dead by then and we're just getting out of our childhood. That is probably one of the single most important evolutionary advances, the long childhood because what happens is that it gives us all of that time to really put our personal stamp on our brain. So all of our experiences that we have throughout this long childhood changes and molds and adapts the detailed circuitry of the brain, so that we build into our brain, the experiences of our individual lifetime. Now a parallel to that same thought experiment, turning the clock back on evolution, 40,000, 40 million years, whatever, and letting it start over again, it's going to be a different result. The same thing can happen with ontogeny, with your own individual life. If you could turn the clock back to the time of your birth, or even more importantly, to the time of your conception, if you could turn that clock back, have everything the same at that time, and then turn it loose, your brain today would be a very different brain than the one you actually have because your brain has depended on the precise experiences that you have had every day of your life. Most other creatures do not have the luxury of that childhood and the building of brain, they get an off the shelf brain that doesn't care if they circle lights, doesn't care if they never get the seed, pecking off to the side here, and doesn't have the processing and the plasticity that the human brain has. So the 30 year childhood to allow that to happen is indeed, a very important gift that humans have with their human brains. Thank you. [APPLAUSE]",""

In trying to understand the cognitive representation of the soul, what I've done in my work with Professor Oglevee and some of his students has been to think out what exactly is the soul all about? Well, many cultures say the soul is immaterial, right? It's not made out of matter. It's not somewhere that you can see it which is exactly what we had described with agency. It is the center of agency or the source of our animacy, the thing that makes us alive. The things that makes us want to do things, and have intentions, and beliefs and desires. In many cultures the soul is the center of our morality. We say that, if a person does something immoral, they have harmed their soul, or they have damaged their soul, and they need to fix it. Many cultures will say that a soul is the essence of a living being. It is the essence of who you are. It is your identity. And finally, many people write about the soul as indivisible. Every person has one soul, you can't have two souls. I'm thinking of a Simpsons episode where Bart Simpson sells his soul, right? We don't think that's actually possible. And so [COUGH] this is the cultural concept, obviously I'm not accounting for all cultures here, but what many people would say if they recognized these things is say yeah I've at least heard that idea somewhere. So we can ask ourselves, these are all things, we can't see a person's morality you need to remember it you need to remember that this person does X or my sense of morality is Y. We can't see those things we say oh okay they are located in the soul. The soul is the thing that drives a person. That is their agency. That you don't know where it is but it's unique to every individual and it describes that person. It's very important to be able to describe and predict other people. And so we would make inferences based on our concept of the soul. So, one of the things we did in trying to understand this, was describe certain sentences about the soul and see how people responded to it. And I'm only going to give you a brief explanation of this, but I think it's useful. So if I told you that Sandra rolled down the hill because she wanted to get to the bottom, and you would say to me, well Sandra is a person. So Sandra is part of the category person. Now Sandra has agency so she can roll down the hill because she wants to. Sandra has what we call a belief desire psychology. She does things because she has certain beliefs and she has certain desires. And Sandra's also subject to the laws of physics. So Sandra can roll down the hill because Sandra is a physical person and when she rolls down the hill, she'll keep rolling. If I told you that the rock rolled down the hill because it wanted to get to the bottom, well you would say to me that's absurd because the rock doesn't have agency. A rock doesn't do things because it wants to do it and a rock doesn't have beliefs and desires. A rock is subject to the laws of physics, but that's where it ends. And so, to say that the rock rolled down the hill because it wanted to get to the bottom that doesn't really make sense. Similarly if I told you Sandra's soul rolled down the hill because it wanted to get to the bottom. Well, you would say to me that yeah, the soul has agency. Probably. The soul has beliefs and desires, probably. But the soul's not subject to the laws of physics. So Sandra might be able to roll down the hill, but Sandra's soul is not able to roll down the hill. So we predicted that this sentence would be absurd. So as I said before, we predicted that the soul was immaterial. Its source of agency, center of morality. And so let's just look at the center of agency. So we asked college students, does a plant have a soul? Does it have a mind? Those two questions. And does a horse have a soul, and does it have a mind? And what we found is that, if we look at the top of this scale means it's absurd and the bottom means it's very reasonable. We would say that people thought it's not really reasonable to say that a shrub has a soul or a mind, but a horse much more reasonable to say it has a soul than a plant. And people were pretty much across the board willing to say that a horse had a mind. But something about uniqueness of individuality makes the soul more a human concept than an animal concept. And because a horse has agency and animacy, because a horse moves around, it's more likely to have a soul than a shrub. Another example that we used was the soul being the center of morality. Not much in this talk is focused around morality, but one of the things we asked was can the soul experience certain emotions? And so we asked can the soul experience disgust, and we thought of two forms of disgust. You see roadkill, you get disgusted. And moral disgust, disgusted by Hitler. And we found that people would say it's much more reasonable to say a person's soul was disgusted by Hitler than a person's soul was disgusted by roadkill. Because a soul is more relevant to morality than to physical symptoms of disgust. So, these are two brief examples that research is still ongoing, but the point that I'm trying to drive home here is that the concept of what we consider reasonable and describe bribing a soul is influenced by these factors of agency, that we think are very important to identifying people in the world and to understanding and predicting the world around us. So if we go back and say the evolutionary context influences our thinking, right? The goals and trials and tribulations of human kind as evolution has it's strongest effect as we were developing those are going to influence how we think. And our modern, our explicit or conscious ideas, may have their roots in evolutionary problems, or evolutionary modes of thinking. We have a certain mode of thinking, that says this thing is important to us. It is important to predict how somebody's going to behave in our environment. And therefore, through that we develop a concept of the soul, that helps us identify the source of that prediction. So the soul is one type of idea that can be relevant in the context of our evolutionary development. And so we can say that religious and cultural concepts build on challenges of our environment. Our environment had a challenge. We needed to describe agency. We needed to put words to it. We needed explain how and why it's happening. We needed to identify moral behavior because we needed to kick the people out of our group if they were acting immorally, if they weren't contributing to our group. We need to keep track of people's essences. We need to know if that person is a good person, or a bad person, or type of person who takes risks, or the type of person who reacts well in situations. I need to know that. And, I can say, there's nothing about looking at that person that tells me. Oh, looking at this person, he reacts well in difficult situations. I don't know that. So, I identify a place, I say that person's soul, that person's essence. That's a person who is quick to jump in an emergency. And so. When we think of a cognitive explanation of the soul, we think of this as taking our unconscious inferences about the world and about other people, and putting them into words. And I'll just leave you with a question to think about what this means about how the concept of soul came to be. Where this came from, how it developed over time, and how it solved useful problems in our environment. So a cognitive approach to religion attempts to understand the mental processes that are involved in thinking about religious concepts. We are not trying to explain away. We're not trying to say, because I've got an explanation, ha-ha, religious concepts are totally illegitimate. It's not trying to make that claim. Although, I'm sure people on both sides of the argument would be able to take those concepts and say, if there was an atheist who was trying to prove his atheism, might take these and use them as proofs. But I think the people on the religious end would also take them as proofs to prove what they were talking about. And this leads us to the notion of doctrinal versus intuitive beliefs. And this is the kind of the last point that I want to make here, that we have well thought out philosophies about how the world works. We have explanations of human behavior. We have explanations of the world, and those are thought out and they're philosophical, and we also have intuitive beliefs. We have our natural gut reactions to how things happen. I'll give you an example of this. At Rutgers University a couple years ago, we sampled students and we found out about 60% of Rutgers students were believers, believed in some God, some religion. 30% were agnostic, and 10% were atheists. But over 95% believe in a soul. So I wouldn't say that the soul and religion are necessarily comparable. They're not the same concept that we're talking about here. But this suggests that whatever your doctrinal beliefs, whatever philosophy you have of the world. Whether it's a specific religious practice, whether it's a specific atheist belief, whether it's somewhere in the middle or some point of indecision, the soul describes an aspect of reality that you find compelling. Or that most people, at least at Rutgers University, rather non-believing place when you compare it to the rest of America, though not many other places in the world. That the soul is compelling, and I'm going to argue here that it's compelling to people who believe and don't believe because it describes an aspect of our experience, and we find that useful. We find that useful in the common challenges and the role that it has in our environment. So thank you very much. >> Thank you, Aldrin, that was very interesting. I was especially interested in one of the examples you gave about not being able to not see something in color because we are wired to do that. And so there are a lot of these things which are coded into our brain. But at the same time, you talked about the long childhood which we've also talked about in a couple of other context in the class. And I'm wondering if you've given any thought to how some of these more complicated ideas, like cheater detection and things like that, might be a part of what we acquire during childhood, that we may have the basic template there. But then have a belief system or some sort of an intuitive analysis that gets developed through social interaction. >> That's a fascinating question. And I think it's very relevant because when we talk about soul beliefs, we're talking about conceptions that are learned, a lot of them. At least the explicit form is learned. And you're really asking the question about a lot of developmental psychology and questions of, well, is the ability their and then it's evoked when the child comes into contact with whatever teaching is necessary? Or is this something that is entirely learned? I think that the argument that the evolutionary psychologists would make is that, no, cheating detection is something that's there. It's not something that's learned, it's something that kids know naturally, and they're very attuned to it from the very early ages. But I wouldn't throw the baby out with the bath water in that sense. I'm not a devoted evolutionary psychologist, though I do spend a lot of time studying it. But I would say that it's certainly possible for a lot of constructs to be things that do emerge through education. >> Yeah, so some of the details of that in terms of a particular set of religious beliefs or cultural beliefs. So it's really just setting the fine tuning on a module that's already there. >> Right, and that would go back to the concept of a meme that I was talking about that there are certain things that we're ready to believe, so to speak. That just because our parents teach us something, doesn't mean that we believe it, although many of us do. But the notion that a lot of this cognitive approach looks is to say, well, these things are things that are easy to believe. Given the way that the mind is structured, this makes sense, it fits our framework. And so it would be kind of talking about a brain that is ready to then take on certain learned concepts. >> Yes, but I think one of the things that's also become apparent as we've gone through this syllabi in this course is there must also be some sort of a, for lack of a better term, defense module in there. >> [LAUGH] >> Because once people have their set of beliefs, it is just very, very difficult to make any change in that. And we almost have an intuitive ability to accept information that is compatible with that, and to automatically reject information that's not. Whether it's a religious belief or a political belief that we really have a lot of easy shorthand ways, which is what you said, that it makes life for successful and simpler if we can do a lot of this quickly and intuitively. >> Right, and I think a lot of recent research, I'm less familiar exactly with this research, but I've read a few things, dabbled in a few things here and there that have made suggestions that the ability that we have to argue has kind of developed not to come to conclusions but to prove that we're right. And so that we've kind of developed a way to argue any point as long as we've dug our hills. >> I love your discussion of memes. I like the whole thing, but memes I wish you been able to bring that into the class because it was something I would have built upon. The soul or the term soul is such a wonderful name because everybody has an intuitive sense of what we are talking about. Most people have different things in mind. But it's there. So I can see how that it's adaptive. It enables us to communicate about a whole bunch of ideas. And it's so easy, convenient, to assume it exists. >> Right. >> Now. There's another assumption that's interesting to me, that it's going to continue to exist. So when I think about the soul course, I describe it to other people and even in my mind, it's soul and afterlife beliefs. >> Mm-hm. >> And that's where religion comes in so strongly, that you not only have a soul, but it's going to go somewhere. And lots and lots of people believe that. It's not just a belief, it's turned into an assumption, which then is turned into a fact. It's just going to happen. There's no questions about it. What are your ideas about how is that adaptable? >> How is belief in the aftermath? >> The belief that it's going to go somewhere. >> That's a very interesting question and so much of my own work has focused on more of the here and now. What is God now? What is the soul now? And I know that the course spent a lot more time emphasizing the afterlife beliefs. >> Over time, we've done that because it- >> Right. And it's a crucial aspect of the soul that isn't really involved in this lecture and, the first thing that strikes me is the notion of episodic memory and the episodic future thinking. That we're constantly, to take a step back, I'm a memory researcher and one of the ideas which is very prevalent in episodic and autobiographical memory research- >> What do you mean by episodic? Episodic memory, being memory for events that are occurring, and when I remember them, I remember what it was like, as opposed to remembering facts, which we would call semantic memory. And so a lot of what people are saying nowadays in episodic memory is that memory is there to guide the future. And the concepts that we hold now exist for the sake of planning future behaviors. And to me, that just seems like that's, the afterlife makes so much sense, because if our memory is constantly about planning for the future, what happens when we get to the point where we don't really envision a future for ourselves? Where we come up against the reality that we're going to die. >> Right. Face into the death. >> And forget the emotional, forget the terror management theory stuff, forget all the reasons why that's scary. But we've got this system that's functioning. This system that's planning our future based on our memory. And so we could again talk about how afterlife belief really makes sense because I was planning for the future and now I don't have to stop planning for the future, and so it would fit in the way of a similar meme. That it says okay, well here's my planning for the future activity and here's how I'm going to apply it. >> I like your response. And there are some occasions when I have the sense that along the line, in some respects, religions have usurped that idea. And said, yes it's true. And that's increased the social control. I mean it's a very powerful mechanism, social control. You're not only behaving yourself because you've got to be a non-cheating member of this tribe. But you're also behaving yourself because you've got forever to live after this. And you better be good because if you're good, you go to a good place, if you're bad, you go to a bad place. I mean, that is so powerful, I mean so dominating part of my thinking right now about the whole matter of afterlife. And it's so prevalent today. We just had a horrible thing, a massacre of little kids in Connecticut and I tuned into a couple of the statements. I mean, you can't get away from them on television. You can't even watch a football game because it's always interrupted with this horrible thing that happened. And there is an upsurge of talk about the soul, it's a very common issue of people trying to deal with this matter. And the notion from variety of religions that these kids now are being, they're in heaven, they're being protected, nothing like this is going to happen. Human beings resonate to that idea. It's becoming so prominent in the in the news that it's, almost for this guy who deals with this, you know like thinks about it, it's shocking. >> Mm-hm. >> To see the power of this thing. And probably has to do with comforting and this sort of thing. But as we progressed, evolved in humans, afterlife has become such a powerful idea. >> Right. And there are so many different perspectives that we can look at it. What you're stressing now is more of a social perspective. I mean you mentioned it as control, and you also mentioned it as comfort, and all of those things factor into it. And I think that's the beauty of a course like this, of saying well, let's look at all the different perspectives because this matters in so many realms our life, and it's not just about anyone of them. It's not just about the evolutionary psychology approach, it's about what these ideas mean for people in their day to day lives. That's what makes it such a fascinating idea, you can look at it from so many different perspectives and get so much. Just so much inference and so many different perspectives that can feed into understanding this concept. >> Well, that's what I like about the course, too. Particularly the idea, once it's in there, it kicks in automatically. This idea and as Len said, it sorts the incoming mail, if it's compatible it'll stay around, if not it pushes it away. This course gives students the opportunity to maybe take a peek and it's automatistic. And once you bring something to mind, it becomes less automatic. And once you think about it As far as I'm concerned, you could put it back in the same place. But at least you thought about it and it increases the possibility. You might think about it again and then maybe, a little bit differently. And that's, I hope, it is a power of this course. >> And I would even argue against this assumption that you're making. Not an assumption, but describing how people are defending beliefs in the face of challenges to the contrary. I would say that the perspective that I'm trying to bring is I'm not trying to deny the fact that that defends a belief. But to say well, maybe they're not defending their beliefs. Maybe it's just that evidence to the contrary seems so nonsensical to them. >> That's great. I like that. Thank you. >> I think one of the somewhat surprising things to me about this course, going back to what you said a minute or so ago. Is that here we have a concept that the vast majority of people believe in and to a large degree, design their lives around. This ought to be a very boring course, but apparently it's not. It has just caught fire and has just become, I think, the most popular course on the Rutgers campus. So there's some sort of an intrigue in having the opportunity to step outside the automatic portion of it and to look at it. And I think that's clearly not what people normally do. Or this course would not have any interest. So I think just the opportunity to examine these beliefs and where they come from and how they're defended seems to be something that holds a lot of attraction to the students. >> I love what you said, because I love anything that makes me think about something differently. But in some instances, it is defense against belief. But your idea that something that goes counter to your automatic beliefs it's counter-intuitive. >> Mm-hm. >> I think one could go a long way with that. It's just counter-intuitive. Yeah. Instead of what I'm thinking, that >> Right. [CROSSTALK] Because you're talking about >> I mean, it fits in perfectly to your lecture. >> Right. And you're talking about people defending their beliefs in your course, as if you're trying to ram a different approach down their throats, which you're not doing. >> No. I try not to. >> Right? I mean the course tries very hard not to be in your face about it or push people to- >> Even Mussolini was backed off. >> Oh really, and it's not about making people think differently it's about making people think. >> Yes. >> And that's why I would say, well, yeah defensive maybe. You know, in some moments, there's a need for defense, but in many other moments, it's just a moment of reflection and then to say, well, these are automatic assumptions. [CROSSTALK]. >> I think this pretty much wraps it up. Thanks again, [CROSSTALK] >> All right, thank you.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/holocaust-introduction-2/lecture/K6VfY/last-unit","Last Unit","[MUSIC] >> Welcome back again. After exposing some aspect of daily life in the camps, and the dreadful meaning of the many prohibitions and death threats, I want us to refer to some more important realities of the camp. One of the elements of dehumanization in the camp and an endless source of suffering for the prisoners was the terrible sanitary conditions. In his book, The Survivor, An Anatomy of Life in Death Camps, Terrence Des Pres wrote about the filth that had become an imminent part of life in the camp. He says that in effect this was also part of the terror the Germans used in order to humiliate, degrade, and weaken the prisoners. It began in the trains. From the beginning, subjection to filth was an aspect of the survivor's ordeal. In Nazi camps, especially, dirt and feces were permanent conditions of existence. The constant presence of filth and bodily waste joined a harsh terror regime that tightly controlled even their basic needs. In the second half of 1943, Bella Rosenblum was deported from Radom ghetto in Poland to Auschwitz. She was 18 years old. In her testimony, she talks about the hygienic condition in the camp, and about the feeling of humiliation and suffocation. We rarely bathed. It was extraordinary to bathe in Auschwitz. We didn't know what tooth brush was. There were no undergarments, not a single item of underwear. Women lost their periods. Under those conditions, we didn't regret it. It was even a good thing, because there was no basic hygiene. No underwear, no sanitary pads. Imagine conditions in which a woman can't take care of her hygiene. It was suffocating. Living in filth, which was a constant physical aspect for the bodies of the prisoners, deeply wounded the psyche as well and highlighted a lack of distinction between body and spirit, a fusion that symbolized the experience of life in the camps. Willie Breller, who was born in 1918 in Czernowitz in the Bukovina region, was prisoner in Auschwitz, Gross-Rosen, and Buchenwald. In talking about the world of the camps, he emphasized the world of death and the dehumanization he was deported to. He realized that in the eyes of the Germans, he's no more than a body. The first thing I learned when I reached the camp is that we're no more bodies. The person in the next bed who died overnight, your fellow worker who was beaten to a pulp by an angry capo, this man is no longer a man but only a body. A body that in an instant becomes waste. These bodies, shriveled, lined up along the path leading to the crematoria, have become unidentifiable waste, raw material. Because I'm no longer a person, my body will be burned, all according to plan. As we have seen in this course, the Germans were well aware of the destructive power of humiliation and use it intentionally for two main reasons. The first, and this was a result that came up mainly in psychological and psychiatric research, was that humiliated people don't resist or rebel. The cognitive abilities narrow to a minimum, and they tend to withdraw inwards, shocked and defenseless. The humiliated foul smelling body, while even its most basic needs have come under complete totalitarian control, has been neutralized of any independent ability to think and mainly to resist. The second reason was that the life forced upon the prisoners by the Germans helped the Germans carry out the violence and murder, because of the sense of distance that these bodies raised in them. These people underwent such a radical dehumanization that their extinction was made to feel natural. One would expect that among prisoners, people who are oppressed, we will see support networks and alliances form. But it was also overturned in the camps. The initial encounter between new inmates and the prisoners who were already in the camp was also a difficult experience. Primo Levi wrote that, one entered hoping at least for the solidarity of ones' companions in misfortune, but the hoped for allies, except in special cases, were not there; there was instead a thousand sealed-off monads, and between them a desperate covert and continuous struggle. This sudden revelation, which became manifest from the very first hours of imprisonment, often in the instant form of aggression on the part of those in whom one hoped to find future allies, was so harsh so to cause the immediate collapse of one's capacity to resist. For many it was lethal, indirectly or even directly: it is difficult to defend oneself against a blow for which one is not prepared. The relationship between the prisoners were complex. They range from terror and hostility to indifference, but there are also examples of solidarity and friendships. In those cases when alliances did form, these were usually based on having similar origin or family relations. We can generalize and say that when alliances form among prisoners, they formed a kind of narrow sphere of existence where the prisoners tried to have a joint struggle for survival. In 1961, Auschwitz survivor Raya Kagan gave her testimony at the trial of the Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann, and she spoke about friendship. Answer. In this hell of Auschwitz, we, for our part, remained alive owing to the fact that there was friendship between us, however strange that may seem. In this place, there was friendship, and there were many instances of solidarity. This was not the case everywhere. The differences were considerable. Question. But within the unit that you knew? Answer. In our unit, we dragged typhus patients with high fever. We dragged them to the office, so that they should not remain in the camp, so that they should not be included in a selection. Question. Is that what kept you going, a solidarity of human relationships, friendship and mutual help? Answer. And devotion which knew no bounds. Still, there were prisoners who never managed to form or simply couldn't form connection to a group, and so had to struggle alone for survival. We see in daily life in the camps a range of relationships and behaviors, ranging from extreme social, moral, and human animals to expression of humanity. I would like to end this lesson on a more optimistic note. Despite the living condition I described, the process of dehumanization, extreme cold, and hunger, despite the terrible loss and fear, most of the survivors managed to return to normal life, even if the scars of the past couldn't be erased. Elana Cohen, born in Slovakia, was sent to Auschwitz at the age of 13. In her testimony she gave to Yad Vashem at 1944, she talks about her life after the holocaust. One thing I thought, that I will never know how to cry and how to laugh. But life has its own power. I laughed a lot and I cried. In this part of the lesson, I focus on daily life in the camps. Of course you cannot discuss or sum up this subject in a short time frame. I hope you've managed to get to know a little about the enormous difficulties of this life. I also hope you have managed to understand the fact that the world of the camp was an essential part of Nazi Germany and its racial ideology. And especially, I hope you will remember the fact that we are talking about people. Those who built the world of the camps, and those who were imprisoned in them. >> Thank you Dr. Shik for trying to open a window for us into this incomprehensible world of a systematic and fundamental destruction of the human soul. As always, more can be read in the excerpts provided to you below, or in our recommended list reading. By now, we not only try to understand, as much as one can, some of the horrifying meaning of death camps, but also try to expose the complicated decision process which led to the final solution. I want us to end our meeting today with a broader perspective, and by applying similar questions regarding the decision making discussed before, this time focusing on a specific place, Auschwitz. When and why did Auschwitz become Auschwitz? When was it decided that this camp would serve as a death center for Jews from all over the continent? At first glance, it seems that's a simple question. We have a document with some specific orders. Rudolf Franz Hoess, who served as Auschwitz commandant for years, and not to be confused with Rudolf Walter Hoess, Hitler's deputy Fuhrer who ultimately landed in England in May 1941, was caught after the war, tried, and eventually hanged in a former camp. Hoess testified in the Nuremberg trials and even wrote his memoirs while in prison, in which one can find the following. In the summer of 1941, I cannot remember the exact date, I was suddenly summoned to the Reichsfuhrer SS Himmler, and said in effect, the Fuhrer has ordered that the Jewish question be solved once and for all, and that we, the SS, are to implement that order. The existing extermination centers in the East are not in a position to carry out the large Aktionen which are anticipated. I have therefore earmarked Auschwitz for this purpose, both because of its good position as regards communications and because the area can easily be isolated and camouflaged. Again, you have the full version below, but by now you must know that documents, all documents must carefully be examined. Do you have any questions regarding those lines? We know Hoess visited Himmler in Berlin in June 1941, yet how could he tell Hoess that the existing extermination centers in the east are not enough? In the summer of 1941, there weren't any death camps. Give me a minute to introduce you briefly to ten dates of Auschwitz camp history, and I hope to show you what could be concluded from Hoess' interesting mistake. On June 14, 1940, 728 Polish political prisoners arrived at Auschwitz. On the 1st of March, 1940, Himmler visited the camp for the first time. And on June, as said, Hoess visited him in Berlin. Between the 3rd and the 5th of September, 1941, Zyklon B was tested on Soviet POWs. In October 1941, construction work began in Birkenau. The first transport of Jewish prisoners, young Jewish women from Slovakia, arrived at the camp on the 26th of March 1942. And on the 30, a transport of men from France. Those still alive and capable were taken to work. During April, May, and June 1942, some Jewish deportation arrived at the camp, mainly from Slovakia, but also a few from Poland, Germany, and France. Some transport were murdered in full, some fully sent to work. In July more transport from France and Slovakia, as well as the first from the Netherlands arrived. Yet the first selection took place on the 4th of July, 1942. On the 17th and 18th of July, Himmler had his second visit at the camp. And starting in August 1942, massive deportations from France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Yugoslavia, the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Greece, Germany, Poland, and Italy arrived, joined in mid 1944 by massive deportations from Hungary. So when do you think Himmler told Hoess that the facilities of the east are not enough? In the summer true, yet in the summer of 1942. Only after this visit, Auschwitz became the main destination for Jews' deportations. Interesting, but not enough. What orders were given during Himmler's first visit, and why was Hoess called to Berlin in the summer of 1941? First, shortly after Hoess visited Berlin in June, 1941, the IG Farben Industrial Corporation start using the camp prisoners as cheap forced labor, enriching the SS and strengthening Himmler. Second, different documents, which could not be presented here, implies that on the first visit Hoess was ordered to prepare the main camp for 30,000 prisoners, and build a new camp, Auschwitz II, for 100,000 prisoners. Why so many? Since Himmler, like many other high-ranking Nazis believed that millions of Russian POWs will be captured soon, he designated Auschwitz as a sorting station where weak prisoners could be killed. This explains why the gas experiments were done on Soviet POWs and not on Jews. When those millions never arrived, the camp got a new mission, the key role in the mass murder of the Jews. History is true painstaking work, and only a careful critical reading of sources can enable us to reach established historical conclusions. This is a fascinating and challenging process, even when dealing with indescribable horror of the mass and sometimes industrial murder of millions of Jews. Many horrible aspects were exposed to you today. Many old questions still remain, and many new ones for sure appeared. In our next meeting we'll try and answer some of them, including how was it humanly possible, and how did Jews and non-Jews react to those atrocities. [MUSIC]",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-middle-east-1/lecture/SCtZh/1-5-the-eastern-question","1.5 The 'Eastern Question'","These are the years in which the so called Eastern question developed. The Eastern question is a question that preoccupied the European powers. But it was really a question about the fate of the Ottoman Empire which had a very critical impact on the European balance of power. The fear of the European powers was that a decline or disappearance of the Ottoman Empire. The collapse of the Ottoman Empire could lead to a European struggle for the remnants of the empire that would upset the balance of power in Europe and create a huge European war. That is what most European powers sought to prevent. The European powers generally speaking, therefore had the collective interest to preserve the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, despite its weakness. So as not to have the disintegration of the empire cause a destabilization of the power relations in Europe. At the end of the 18th century and at the beginning of the 19th, Russia posed the greatest challenge to the Ottoman Empire. And there were two components of this Russian challenge. The religious factor. Russia's support for Orthodox Christians in the Middle East, and the strategic factor. Russia's desire to advance southwards to the black sea. Hence the importance of the straits, the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, in order to eventually reach the Mediterranean. Britain also became an interested party in the affairs of the Middle East. As a result of her acquisition of empire in India, the so-called Jewel in the Crown of the British Empire. To maintain connection with India, Britain obviously required safe passage which went through the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Britain therefore acquired a very great interest in the preservation of Middle Eastern stability. But things were not always easily manageable. Bonaparte's expedition to Egypt in 1798 is a typical example of these kinds of difficult management. Napoleon occupied Cairo in July 1798. A month later in August, the French fleet was destroyed by the British in the battle of the Nile, severing Napoleon's communications with France. In September of 1798, the Ottoman's declared war on France and entered into an alliance against France with both Britain and Russia. Bonaparte set off into Syria but was stopped at Acre in May 1799, and he returned to France. In 1801, the French force in Egypt finally surrendered to a British expeditionary force. Britain and Russia were now firmly allied to preserve the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. But a new reality had emerged in Egypt in the meantime. In the aftermath of the French Occupation, Muhammad Ali an Ottoman Officer of Albanian origin who was posted by the Ottomans to Egypt, gradually assumed control of Egypt as the local ruler de facto. Muhammad Ali became the creator of modern Egypt, essentially separating Egypt from the Ottoman Empire, instituting military reforms after which followed a whole host of other reforms in other spheres. Actually moving ahead in reform, ahead of the Ottoman Empire. Mohammed Ali established his own autonomous control of Egypt in the early 19th century. And thus he, Muhammad Ali and Egypt also became a part of the famous Eastern Question. A cool component of this Eastern Question during the 19th century, was the conflict between the Ottoman Empire and its Christian subjects. In the Balkans in particular. Christians in the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans were eagerly discussing and adopting modern European ideas like nationalism. And it was with European support that they were eventually succesful in their struggles for independence. The Greeks were the first in the 1820s, followed by others like the Serbs, the Romanians, and the Bulgarians. There was a dominant religious element in these nationalist movements. It was after all, always Christians fighting against Muslims. And thus the natural support of the Europeans for these newly emerging Christian independent movements versus the Ottomans. European support for Greek independence was also motivated by a romanticized image of ancient Greece related to this new struggle of the Greeks for their independence. As the Ottomans seemed to be losing in this struggle with the Greeks, Muhammad Ali now the de facto ruler in Egypt was called in by the Ottomans to help suppress the Greek uprising. But the Turco-Egyptian fleets were defeated in Navarino, by a combined British, France force in 1827. Muhammad Ali was promised Syria in return for his assistance, but the Ottomans did not keep their promise. And Muhammad Ali invaded Palestine and Syria in 1831, and defeated the Ottomans in Konya which is deep inside Anatolia in 1832. Muhammad Ali was now really threatening the integrity of the Ottoman Empire and in their despair, the Ottoman sword held from Russia and they signed a defense pack with the Russians in 1833. The Russians were interested in preserving the integrity of the Ottoman Empire against other threats, but this gave the impression to other European Powers that Russia was acquiring a de facto protectorate over the Ottoman Empire. Britain therefore became committed to removing Muhammad Ali from Syria, not because she cared so much about the Near East, but because of Britain's concerns about the balance of power in Europe. Muhammad Ali defeated the Ottomans again in 1839. And Britain and Russia cooperated to remove the threat posed by Muhammad Ali, forced him out of Syria and back to Egypt. But Muhammad Ali was now given the hereditary possession of Egypt in exchange for his removal from Syria. That meant that Egypt was no longer only under the rule of Muhammad Ali, but it was promised as an inheritance to Muhammad Ali's sons, and their sons after him. Thus creating a dynasty which ruled in Egypt all along until 1952 when overthrown by the Egyptian officers under General Anagib and Colonel Nasser. Matters were destabilized again between the powers in 1854, with the outbreak of the Crimean war. This was a war that the Russians fought against the Ottomans and the Ottomans now backed by Britain and France against the Russians. The trouble was ignited at first by conflict between France and Russia on the protection of Christian holy places in Palestine. The Russians demanded concessions from the Ottomans who refused, resulting in war, eventually brought to an end by the Peace of Paris in 1856. The Peace of Paris again, guaranteed the territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire by the European powers. But in return for this European guarantee of Ottoman integrity the Sultan promised reforms and better treatment of Christian minorities. What this meant in conclusion, was a growing European interest and interference in the lands of the Ottoman Empire. Which had also led to the promotion of nationalists movements threatening the empire. Made it absolutely crucial for the rulers of the Ottoman Empire to engage in urgent reform to save the empire. Reforms did not save the empire in the end but they eventually helped to create the modern Middle East as we know it. In our next lesson, we will engage in these reforms that changed the empire and introduced the modern Middle East.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/history-israel/lecture/qZ8dW/the-non-promised-land","The Non-Promised land","But it was not that the British had promised the same territories to different players. As some people say, Palestine, the twice promised land. In fact, there was no substantial discrepancy between the documents and the British had generally been quite consistent. The British could not have promised Palestine to the Arab state without consulting France, their ally. And therefore Palestine was not promised to the Arabs, but Palestine was not promised to the Jews either. In reference to Zionist demands, what the British did do in the Balfour Declaration was to express their sympathy for a national home for the Jews in Palestine. So let's look at the Balfour Declaration. The war itself had its impact on the impending dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. This offered the Zionists the opportunity they were looking for to possibly obtain Palestine for themselves. The British themselves had their own interest in Palestine, particularly in connection to the protection of the Suez Canal and the passage to India. Prime Minister Lloyd George certainly recognized this British imperial interest. Lloyd George however also had a religious upbringing and because of his knowledge of the bible the appeal of a British protected Jewish colony in Palestine made sense to the British Prime Minister. In 1917 the Allies were in a sorry state in the prosecution of the war. And the British believed issuing a declaration on behalf of Zionist aspirations in Palestine would improve the position of the Allies in the war. They believed that the United States could become more involved in the war. And that Russia would stay in the war thanks to Jewish influence that would be exerted on these great powers to participate more actively in the war because of Zionist aspirations that would be promised by the British. That the support for Zionist aspirations would help propaganda in the U.S. and Russia and thus the war effort thanks to the great effect of Jewish influence. However exaggerated this British opinion of Jewish influence may have been, and exaggerated it definitely was. This was a factor in their decision to issue the Balfour Declaration. So what did the Declaration say exactly? In this letter by the British Foreign Minister, Lord Balfour, to the leader of the Jewish community in Great Britain, Lord Rothschild, the British government declared its sympathy for Zionist aspirations in Palestine. The British government in this expression of sympathy viewed with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people. It is interesting to note, view with favor, sympathy, somewhat less than outright express support and endorsement. Secondly, it was not entirely clear what a national home really meant. And thirdly, what ever this national home was to be it was to be in Palestine. Not the conversion of Palestine into a Jewish national home. These are two very different things. Furthermore, the Declaration noted that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine. That is, whatever the Jews did establish in Palestine could not be damaging to the rights of the Arab people who already lived there. This was all in a letter as we have seen by Balfour to Lord Rothschild, a rather low-key expression of British policy. It was not, for example, a declaration of policy given in Parliament. But nevertheless, for the Zionists this was understood to mean support for a Jewish state. But as the British historian Malcolm Yapp has summarized, the Declaration was virtually meaningless and committed Britain to nothing. When the war came to an end in the Middle East, Britain was by far the superior power in that part of the world. This, as the British historian and journalist Elizabeth Monroe has written, this was Britain's moment in the Middle East. The Ottoman Empire had come to an end. The French were completely preoccupied at the front in France and they could only spare token forces for the Middle East. Russia was preoccupied by revolution and her opting out of the war. So British occupation forces took over most of the Arab areas of the empire in Syria, Iraq, and Palestine, and there was only a small French force in Lebanon. So the great powers and especially Britain could shape the region more or less as they wished. And the drawing of the borders of the future Arab states in the Middle East were very much part of British-French trade-offs. And it was the French, the weaker party, who made concessions to the British in both Palestine and Mosul. As you may recall from the Sykes-Picot Agreement, Palestine was shared by the French and the British. It was now given over by the French solely to Britain. Mosul became part of British-ruled Iraq rather than French-ruled Syria. These areas of the the Sykes-Picot Agreement were now divided up by the victorious powers into mandates that were handed over to the French and to the British. At the Conference of the European Victorious Powers that was held in San Remo in April 1920, the mandates were delivered to Britain and France. Lebanon and Syria became French mandates. Britain controlled Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq. In this creation of the mandate system there was a very significant upgrading of the British commitment to the Zionists. The British mandate for Palestine as published officially in July 1922 transformed the commitment made in the Balfour Declaration to a British commitment to the international community, to the League of Nations, much more than a letter to Lord Rothschild. Moreover, the formal document of the mandate also recognized the historical ties of the Jewish people to Palestine. So while the mandate upgraded the British commitment to the Zionists, the mandate also determined finally that the area lying to the east of the Jordan would become an Arab state, that is Transjordan. And that area would be from the very outset excluded from the British commitments to the Zionists. Therefore, Transjordan as an Arab state would not be a zone of Jewish settlement or creation of the Jewish national home, which was now restricted to western Palestine only. And eastern Palestine now became Transjordan and destined to become an independent Arab state.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/history-israel/lecture/aVQxR/wwi-british-interests","WWI & British interests","World War I brought about the end of the Ottoman Empire and the end of 400 years of Ottoman Turkish rule over the Arab parts of much of the Middle East. From the ruins of the empire, the modern Middle Eastern state system was created. Before the war, the European powers sought to preserve the integrity of the Ottoman empire for the sake of European peace. The belief or the fear in Europe was that if the Ottoman Empire were to fall apart the European powers would find themselves very quickly in a disastrous war in the fight for the spoils of the Empire. After the outbreak of World War I, that logic was no longer relevant. Once there already was a war in place, there was no longer a fear of having to fight for the spoils of the Empire. The Ottoman decision to side with Germany and Austria sealed the fate of the Empire. The Western powers, Britain and France, and initially the Russians too, had every reason and interest to seek the Empire's defeat and dismemberment. And secret talks began between the powers on the carving up of the Ottoman Empire after the war. The Russians wanted the straits, the Bosporus and the Dardanelles, to enable them to get into the warm waters of the Mediterranean. The French wanted Syria, especially the coastal area and Palestine too. The British wanted Iraq because of the Persian Gulf in India and the connection from there to the Mediterranean which created a challenge to the French demands in that area. So there was a negotiation, a secret negotiation between the British and the French which led to the signing of what became the notorious Sykes-Picot Agreement. Signed between the British representative Mark Sykes and the French Franois Georges-Picot. The French were given a free hand in Cilicia, which is in southern Anatolia, and in coastal Syria and Lebanon, as well as a sphere of influence stretching eastwards all the way to Mosul. Britain got a free hand in Iraq, including Basra and Baghdad, and a sphere of influence going westwards towards the Mediterranean. Britain got the ports of Haifa and Acre in Palestine and much of the rest of Palestine too, under an international administration, to be shared with France and with Russian agreement. Russia was soon overtaken by the revolution and opted out of the colonial spoils. In the meantime, the British also conducted negotiations with the Arabs. Britain, because of her Indian interests, was deeply concerned by the sultan's appeal to the Muslims to join the jihad against the enemies of the empire. And as a result, the British were in a desperate search for an Arab-Muslim ally to join the war against the Ottomans. The connection with the Arabs was made through the Hashemites. Who were the Hashemites? The Hashemites were an Arab family, an Arab-Muslim family of very prestigious lineage, as descendants of the Prophet, who was himself of the House of Hashim. In the summer of 1915, in their negotiations with the British, the Hashemites under Hussein Ibn Ali who was the administrator of the holy cities Mecca and Medina on behalf of the Ottomans. Hussein Ibn Ali demanded a caliphate under Hashemite-Arab rule. The demand was for the Arab provinces of the empire from the southern border of Turkey to the Indian Ocean, and from the Mediterranean to the border with Iran. North Africa, including Egypt, were not seen as part of the Arab nation. There was an element of realism in this due to the fact that North Africa then was in the hands of a variety of colonial powers, France, Italy, and Britain. But also, the belief that the North Africans were actually not really part of the Arab nation. The correspondence was conducted by Sir Henry McMahon, who was the British high commissioner in Egypt. McMahon agreed to the Arab demands with a number of important reservations. But the question is, why did the British agree in the first place, albeit with various reservations? The British believed that cooperation with the Arabs would lead to an effective contribution to the war effort that would be made by an Arab uprising against the Turks. The British also believed that siding with Arab nationalism would serve Britain's post war interest in the Middle East in their competition with the French. And furthermore, the Middle East was critically important for British imperial communications. After all, the passage to India and oil for the great British fleet, the backbone of their imperial power, were all connected to the Middle East. So what were the reservations? These were mainly two. One was that certain areas were excluded on the grounds that they were not purely Arab. The second was that British promises related only to those portions of the territories wherein Great Britain was free to act, without detriment to her ally, France. These reservations were cause for great controversy after the war, especially over the question of Palestine.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/history-israel/lecture/14nMS/the-impact-on-the-jews-in-europe-the-yishuv","The impact on the Jews in Europe & the Yishuv","The war that started in Europe in 1914 and spread to the Middle East severely impeded the Zionist activities in Europe and in Palestine. Two coalitions fought each other, England, France, Russia, and later the United States on one side, and Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire on the other. Europe was divided between fighting enemies. Officially, the Zionist leader declared neutrality. But on a practical level, Zionist institutions ceased to operate. The Zionist headquarters was in Berlin, its financial and operations center in England. The potential manpower for immigration came from Russia. And the land was under the Ottoman control. All lines of communication stopped between these places during the war. Vast immigration stopped, money could not be transferred. Sea transportation became unsafe, trade diminished and the annual Zionist meeting was suspended. The war also tragically challenged the Zionist's assumption about the Jewish nation. Most Jews supported their countries. German-Jewish soldiers fought against French and British-Jewish soldiers and even killed each other. No real Jewish solidarity surfaced during the war. Despite these obstacles, some prominent Zionist figures became famous due to the participation in the war effort of their country. This was the case of Chaim Weizmann, a Russian-born Jew who immigrated to England, and became a famous scientist. Working as a chemist in the British war office, he improved its ammunition and developed coded relationship with British top leaders and officials. Another figure was Joseph Trumpeldor, a Russian Jewish officer and Zionist leader that organized Jewish battalions that fought in the British Army. A third figure was a Zionist intellectual, Zeev Jabotinsky, who worked in London and helped forming another Jewish battalion within the British Army. These three figures became, during the war, the unofficial leaders of the Zionist movement. Thus despite official deadlock, Zionist activities during the war continued from London. For the Jewish community in Palestine, the war was a real tragedy. The Ottoman rulers viewed the Jews who came from Russia as an enemy, a fifth column, and forced them to become Ottoman subjects. They declared their compulsory enlistment to the Ottoman army. And those who refused were forcefully imprisoned, or expelled from the country. Out of 80,000 Jews, more than 11,000 left, most of them to Alexandria. The Ottoman feared collaboration between the Jews and the British forces that approached from the south. A small underground Jewish espionage network, which provided intelligence to the British was found and increased the Ottoman suspicion. At a certain point, the Ottoman exiled hundred of people from Tel Aviv, and the center, to the north. Family were devastated. People lost their means for survival. Hunger, flu, and locust epidemics amplified the suffering, increasing the toll of death and starvation. The leader of the Jewish community tried to cope with the disaster. They raised some money from American Jewish relief organizations, organized emergency measures and formed many support organizations in order to endure the hard times until the end of the war. When the British forces entered the area and conquered the southern part of the land in 1917, many hoped for British victory. It took the British forces almost another year to gain control over the entire land. British and French victory over the Ottoman Empire in the Middle Eastern front, Led to a tremendous change all over the Middle East. This change had an enormous impact on the Zionist movement and on Jews and Arabs who lived in the area.",""

Professor Shapira was awarded the Israel Prize of 2008. She specializes in history of Israel and history of the Zionist movement. Anita, hello and thank you for coming. >> Hello. >> The member of the first and second waves of immigration came from the Russian empire. To what extent they brought with them the Russian culture that they grew up with? >> First of all, they read Russian. The books that they adored, the books that actually educated them were in Russian. Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Turgenev, these were the symbols of the first and second Aliyah. What's more, they absorbed the ideology of the Narodniks, of the people who went to the people. The young students who saw their duty to devote their life to the betterment of the situation of the masses. So just like the Narodniks went to the villages and tried to educate the peasants, so the first and second Aliyah people came to Palestine with the intention to better the faith of the Jewish people. They had the ideology that they had to devote their life, to dedicate themselves to the future of the Jewish people. >> How did they implement this kind of world view in the new surrounding of the Middle East, and have they any attitude towards the native people that they encounter in Palestine? >> First of all, they certainly kept the Russian culture, which was the only European culture they knew. Apart from that, they absorbed the Jewish culture, but none other European culture. So, they kept on, because it symbolized to them, their being part of the enlightened world. On the other hand, they met the native Arabs, and they were certainly influenced by them, again in contradiction with race. They were very much influenced by the Arab way of life. They saw the Bedouins in the image of the ancient Hebrews that lived in the country, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob. And they believed that the Arab villages, in a way, implied the way of our forefathers. On the other hand, they were threatened by them, there were all the time skirmishes. And there were, I would not say attacks, but there were clashes around the questions of water, and around the question of land, and around the question of the right of passage, grazing and so forth. So it was a mixture. On the one hand, a wish to come near and to create understanding between Jews and Arabs. And on the other hand, fear and resentment at the clashes. >> I see. Do they transform themselves by this new experiment in the Middle East? Did this new environment really had effect on their own identity or the identity of their children? >> There were groups that were very much impacted by the Arab culture. For instance, the group called Ha-Shomer, which was an clandestine Jewish militia, and they dressed like Arabs. They rode the beautiful horses like the Arabs. They also had in their homes what the Arabs call medodphe, which means the place where they host guests. So, in a way, they were influenced by them, but as I said before, there was a reticence. There was a feeling of fear in the air. As one of their famous writers Reno wrote, there was a feeling that we were living on a volcano. >> Thank you very much for this insight.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/history-israel/lecture/xRU60/the-2nd-aliyah","The 2nd Aliyah","The second wave of Zionist immigration started at the turn of the century, and lasted until the break of the Great War in 1914. About 35,000 immigrants came from the same area of eastern Europe as the former immigrants. They joined similar Zionist association. They belonged to the same social cohort of young, educated, urban, Jewish low-middle class of the small towns. However, most of them had the socialist ideology, striving to create the socialist, just, classless, secular society in the new place. These aspirations clashed with the situation they found in the settlements in Palestine, where farmers who owned land and property, employed local Arab laborers. Members of the second wave of immigration organized themselves in socialist labor collectives and struggled to get jobs in the few existing rural settlements. Most of the effort ended in failure. It reinforced their belief in class struggle and in the necessity to fight for a new society built on collective socialist foundations. The establishment of the Palestinian Office of the Zionist movement by Arthur Rupin, a German-Jewish expert on demography and agricultural development, partly helped these socialist pioneers to carry out their ideas. The office allocated money from various donors and contributors and purchased lands from Arab landlords who legally owned the land under the Ottoman regime. Most of these landlords never visited the area but sold this land for money. The office lent portions of it to group of settlers as collective national ventures. First, the office established a training program for agricultural farmers, male and female, whereby new immigrants learn to become farmers. Then they got the land to build an agricultural settlement. As a result, new form of collective and semi-collective agriculture communities were developed primarily in the northern part of the country. The most well known collective community evolved to become kibbutzim, a community without private property where all form of ownership was shared equally by all members. And where all activities such as work, health, education, culture and leisure were common. Most members of the second wave of immigration, despite the rural collective beliefs, lived in towns and cities. They established national institutions and promoted socialist ideas. They even formed socialist parties such as and the Workers of which would later unite to become the leading labor party of the Zionist community. They embraced and participated in the revival of modern Hebrew culture, above all, by using Hebrew as their first language. They built a new school where the instruction was in Hebrew and founded the Teacher's Association and the professional trade union committed to education the young generation. They engaged in a language war in the Technion, the first institution of higher education that was established in Palestine, forcing it to change its language of instruction from German to Hebrew. A few members of the second wave of immigration founded the French militia in order to guard the field and protect the property against robbers and thieves. They trusted neither the Arab guard nor the official Ottoman police, thus creating the first organizations of Jewish self-defense. The phenomena of a Jewish warrior, holding a rifle and riding a horse, became one of the new images of the Hebrew pioneer. These few militia people laid the ground for the upcoming Zionist organization of defense,1909 is the founding year of both Deganya and Tel Aviv. Deganya was the first collective community that later spread into a whole network of hundreds of kibbutzism. Tel Aviv was the first modern neighborhood outside that rapidly developed into the urban center of modern Israel. Deganya represented the rural collective, socialist nature of Zionism. Tel Aviv, it's urban, individualistic, capitalistic face. Yet despite these differences, both places have a lot in common. They both demonstrate the modern, secular, basically European character of the new Hebrew society that began to grow at the turn of the century. In sum, the early Zionist settlement in [INAUDIBLE] began in 1882 and lasted until the break of the First World War in 1914. By the end of this period, about 80,000 Jews lived in the country that was under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Most immigrants came from Eastern Europe, and a few thousand came from Yemen. The immigrants of the first wave came to settle the land and a new productive life. The immigrants of the second wave aspired to realize their socialist and Zionist ideas and to revolutionize the personal and collective life. This period laid the ground for Zionist Jewish life in the country, for the creation of economic and social institutions, political parties, and new language and culture",""

It was an area in the Eastern Mediterranean under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. Lacking clear geographical boundaries, this place stretched from the coastal line in the west, to the Jordan River in the east. From an unclear desert land in the south to the Lebanese mountain and southern Syria in the north. The reason was located at the periphery of the empire and it had no modern infrastructure. Based on various sources, an estimated 300,000 inhabitants populated it in the late 19th century. Most of the population were Arabs from various tribes and origins. About 20,000 Jews resided in this badly defined territory. Half of them lived in Jerusalem, and the rest in other ancient holy towns such as Safed, Tiberias and Heberon. These were traditional communities whose ancestors immigrate throughout many centuries to the Holy Land, driven by messianic dreams and religious aspirations. Some came from Europe and belonged to the Ashkenazi ethnic group, but the majority came from Mediterranean origins, and considered themselves as part of the Sephardi, later defined as Oriental ethic group. These Jews were not Zionists, and identified themselves through religious beliefs and ethnic affiliation, and not through national character. The Zionists called them the old community. Without any source of subsistence, these Jews were supported by Jewish philanthropic money from abroad. Poor and overpopulated in crowded old cities, some of them began to leave their neighborhoods. Striving for more productive life. They built the first Jewish neighborhoods in Jerusalem and Jaffa outside the wall of the old quarters. Few even tried to look for land away from the city but failed. When the first Zionist immigrants arrived in Palestine in 1882, they encountered some of the members of the old community. Around 25,000 immigrants came to the area during the first wave of immigration that lasted until 1903. Most of the immigrants were young practical Zionists from Russia, suffering from riots and persecution they decided to immigrate to Palestine in order to become pioneers and productive farmers. They build about 20 settlements on the Coastal line in the Galilee. Most of them completely failed after a year. Harsh weather, no infrastructure, economic insecurity, physical vulnerability, lack of agricultural knowledge, malaria epidemics, and an absence of financial resources cause death and misery, agony and despair. Unable to overcome the difficulties these young pioneers reach a verge of starvation. They plead for financial support, which was given to them by Baron Edmond De Rothschild, the rich Jewish banker and philanthropist. He gave money to the settlers and practically save them. However for a few years, they were under his custody and control. He managed the settlement through a French bureaucracy that he appointed over the farmers who found themselves to be superfluous and redundant. Only a decade later he sold his shares and released his hold over the settlement. Despite their minor achievement, the first immigrants built small agricultural village, cultivated the soil, and grew a bit of crop for the shiel providers. As farmers who leased the land, they slowly managed to own small property using Arab manual work and family resources to hold on the farm. Most of them kept Jewish tradition and modes of religious worship. Other immigrants failed to build rural communities and found themselves in cities like Jerusalem, Jaffa, or Haifa. One-third of the immigrants could not face the difficulties and emigrated back to Europe and to North America.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/history-israel/lecture/yikud/other-versions-of-zionizm","Other Versions of Zionizm","Many Zionist leaders and thinkers envision the Zionist purpose far beyond its practical and political aims. For example, Asher Ginzburg, better known by his theatre name, Achad Ha'am, one of the people who participated in the first Zionist conquest claimed that both practical and political Zionists say nothing about the essence of the new nation of revival. He longed for a cultural and spiritual center in the land of Israel that will guide the movement. Giving it values and direction beyond the material solutions of sanctuary and refuge to persecuted Jews. Ha'am and his follower focused on revival of the Hebrew language, Hebrew education based on tradition and modernity, Hebrew values and Hebrew culture. It was hard to translate such an approach to a practical experiment. However, spiritual and cultural Zionism made an enormous impact on Zionist writers, poets, artists, and teachers who strove to revive Judaism and adapt it to the modern world by building schools, writing books, printing journals, and creating art. Another faction of Zionism can be found within the socialist movement. Few socialist Jews integrated the revolutionary passion with their nationalist aspirations. They viewed Zionism as a Jewish revolutionary movement. Envisioned the creation of a just society on the land of Israel. And dreamt of socialist, classless communities without expectation and without private property. Some were Marxist, and other adopted social democratic version of socialism. Their vision was a just society was translated to communal socialist experiments such as the kibbatine. They also hoped to form a socialist party, socialist youth movement, trade unions, and other labor organizations. David Ben-Gurion, Israel's ultimate founding father and its first prime minister, viewed himself as a socialist at least till the furtive. And gain his power through the leadership of the labor camp throughout his political career. The Socialist ideology permeated Zionism and provide the movement with many ideal symbols and images of a utopian exemplary society. A classless society and a nationless sovereignty are the only means of solving the Jewish problem completely, wrote Nachman Silke, one of the early socialist Zionist thinkers. One interesting brand of the movement was religious Zionism. Initially marginal within the movement, some religious leaders advocated the revival of Jewish nationalism on the basis of Jewish faith. They argued that the complete Jew had to practice Jewish mitzvah that are related to God. To other men, and to a particular place of the land of Israel. Only then, the prophets of messianic redemption can start. Therefore, Zionism is not an affront against God, but rather the first step towards culminating the divine plan of messianic redemption. They were condemned by most of the religious Jews who oppose Zionism as a form of heresy and blasphemy. But the religious Zionists joined forces with nonobservant Zionists to promote their particular fusion of Jewish religion and Jewish nation allegiance. Today, these groups of nationally religious families are moving from the periphery of the movement to the center and even to hegemonic status in various Israeli institutions. To sum up, various Zionists view differently, the Jewish predicament, and suggest a diverse solution. Yet they view these differences as controversies within a family since they were accustomed to the old Jewish culture of debate and disagreement, they couldn't most of time reach common ground from which they could overcome their internal disagreements. Chaim Weizmann, the head of the World Zionist organization and the Jewish agency from 1920 until 1946 called this synthetic Zionism. It meant to him basically, the challenge to enhance and promote both practical and political Zionism, with an ability to incorporate various branches of the movement in order to achieve its goal of creating a viable Jewish national community in Palestine.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/history-israel/lecture/jkSZP/political-zionism","Political Zionism","Despite these early attempts of Practical Zionists, the founder of the Zionist movement, as a political movement aiming to establish a state for the Jews in the land of Israel, was Theodor Herzl. Originally, a secular assimilationist Jew from Central Europe, Herzl was a liberal journalist that resided in Vienna. He converted to the Zionist idea following his experience as a journalist who covered the Dreyfus Affair. This event took place in France, whereby a Jewish officer was falsely accused of treason against his country and sent to years in exile. Based on anti-Semitic sentiment and right wing allegations, this judicial travesty opened the public debate in France that ended with acquittal of Dreyfus only ten years later. Outside the court, the mob shouted, death to the Jews. And this event convinced Herzl that if such incident occurred in France, the most emancipated and progressive country, Jews have no future in Europe. Since that event, he devoted his life to find a new place outside Europe for the Jews. He met with kings, ministers, and officials all over Europe in order to convince them to support the Jewish mass immigration from Europe to the land of Israel. He tried to persuade the Ottoman officials who controlled Palestine that they will benefit from such a mass immigration. But all these attempts that exhausted Herzl's capital and health failed. In vain, he tried to grant an official charter from a European great power that would recognize and support the Zionist goal of creating a state for the Jews in Palestine. On the other hand, Herzl succeeded in building Zionist institutions. He founded the Zionist Congress and created permanent political, financial, and cultural institutions in order to spread the Zionist idea to Jews all over Europe. Herzl also wrote two important books on the issue. The state of the Jew, the depicted, the future of the state that will materialize out of the Zionist vision and Altneuland, a Utopian fictional novel on the life of such a futile state. Hertzl's wish was to secure and create a state for the Jews as an official and formal project recognized by international law and international consent. The first Zionist Congress in 1897 that took place in Basil declared that Zionism seeks to establish a home for the Jewish people in Palestine secured under public law. Unlike practical Zionists, Herzl and political Zionism sought to establish a state that would precede the creation of the Jewish society. Following the establishment of such a recognized and formal state, the Jews would immigrate and start to build a sovereign society. Therefore, Herzl criticized the immigration and settlement of practical Zionists from eastern Europe as premature and viewed this whole endeavor as futile and useless. Except for the new institution, the effort of political Zionism did not take off in Herzl's time. No great power support his ideas. Most of the Jews rejected Zionism. And Herzl failed to convince rich Jewish philanthropists to financially support the Zionist vision. A late offer by Great Britain to allocate land for Zionist settlement in Uganda evoked some hope in Herzl and his supporters. However, it was rejected by the Zionists who could not accept any idea of Zionism without Zion at any place other than the ancestral land of Israel. Herzl is known to utter the proverb, if you wish it, it is no dream. But he died at the age of 44 in 1904 without any concrete achievements of his goal. However, he laid the foundation of Zionism as a political movement, and created its institutional framework. Therefore, he is perceived in the history of modern Israel as the founder of Zionism and the prophet and seer of the State of Israel.",""

The arch of Titus commemorates that event, and has continued to commemorate that event for nearly 2,000 years. An object that became central to Christian understandings of Christianity and its relationship with Judaism and with the Roman Empire. And an object which continued to be a sore for Jews into the present, and in fact, provided the symbol for the modern state of Israel, the lamp stand, the menorah, brought from Rome, illustrated on the arch, and now the emblem of modern Israel. And so objects like these provide a window into the past, which is also a window into our present. And that's what we're here to study. [MUSIC]",""

Modeled on the house of Julius Caesar's father-in-law at a place called Herculaneum which was destroyed together with Pompeii, it's just close by. Underneath the place that we're standing is a parking garage. We're in a place of fantasy, and so part of the art is taking the text and taking the artifacts and putting them together and projecting into space imaginary people. People who have been dead for 2,000 years but whose lips we can make move and whose bodies we can make move if we take everything we know about them, put it together, and are willing to dream just a little bit.

This is one of the great collections of Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art in the United States, probably the third largest. >> Well in 69 there was a major upheaval in the Roman Empire. They call it the Year of the Four Emperors. And in that Year of the Four Emperors, there was a succession of instability after the fall of the emperor Nero. Until one of them managed to take control, a fellow named Vespasian. And Vespasian spent the rest of his reign legitimizing his sons, Titus and then Domitian. And one of the ways that they showed how Roman they were, how essential they were to the culture, was by building. They built a thing called the Colosseum. Right? Using, we now know from an inscription. >> Extraordinary. >> Extraordinary. Using funds from the war, meaning the Jewish war, probably funds from the temple in Jerusalem. They built two triumphal arches to Titus, they built theaters, they build baths, they built palaces, they built a new city. Sort of what Getty was doing in his canyon and what all of Los Angeles was doing in the 20s and 30s and 40s and 50s, just building up something brand new. Except they were taking over Rome. And the Arch of Titus was just one of those. Which is what I find so interesting about it. So, the same people who are living in houses like this were witnessing that kind of process.",""
"https://www.coursera.org/learn/archoftitus/lecture/I6QMA/objects-depicted-on-the-arch","Objects Depicted on the Arch","So, the Arch is this archaeological, important artifact in the center of Rome, but how is it part of art history? It represents the emperors, Titus and his state of Rome at the time and the subjugation of Jews can be interpreted. But how would an artist or an art historian look at this archaeological object? >> Well, the reason it's part of art history is because art historians put it in the textbook that create this canon, this measured in of what's important and what's not, right? First of all, any time you have an ancient artifact that big, it's worthy of paying attention to. I mean, if it were the, and particularly if it has human images, we tend to like human images. If an artifact's had larger meaning than it's own period, we tend to like that. For an artifact like this one that deals with empire, which means it deals with nationalism, which means it deals with power and military and deals with the emperors, it has everything good. It has all those things you'd want if you were a good 18th or 19th century modernist forming your modern cultural ethos. And so it's significance as an important cultural marker for Christians, not so much for Jews. No one cared much what Jews thought, but for Christians and for Romans, gave it that status. Now from a strictly sort of formal standpoint, it's important because of its sleekness. We have lots of Roman triumphal arches, but there are very few with this very, very clean set of lines. And this very simple, single arch at its center with a high attic with an inscription. We don't have that many that are preserved from antiquity. When you add to that for the bas reliefs, the imagery of the temple spoils of Titus and his chariot of Titus on the back of an eagle going into the heavens, and the state of preservation, it's really very impressive. Now we know why it's preserved so well, because it was of interest to Christians over a very long period. And so it didn't get dismantled, and it wasn't turned into chalk, and it wasn't made into cement. It was kept and so it's unique in that it's preserved. It's preserved because it was of continued, usable history. Right. And it is significant in the amount, the level of movement that is preserved in stone in this artifact. And so from an art, straight art historical formal perspective, it gives you a real sense of the majesty of the Roman Empire. Of the imperial procession, in a way that very few artifacts do, from this moment, from the first century of the Common Era. We have a lot of stuff from the second Century. In Asia Minor there's a lot of second century material. In Rome there's a lot of second and third and fourth century material. But there's not that much first century material that's so whole. Now remember that it was reconstructed. It was the archway into a private residential complex. So the arch on the inside is well-preserved. The arch on the outside is reconstructed. And they did a really good job of reconstructing it in the 19th century, but they were so careful on the reconstruction, and this is something for us to remember. They were so careful on their reconstruction that they used a different kind of stone for anything they were adding. So that would be very clear ,people ask me sometimes now that you found the color are you going to paint it. No because we could be wrong.",""

We're going to be having a colloquium. [MUSIC] A few words about the Arch itself. The release of the Arch of Titus are among the best preserved and most famous examples of this kind of art to have come down from antiquity. This is undoubtably owing to their subject matter, the triumphal parade that the General, soon to be Emperor Titus, son of Vespasian, that traversed this area of the Via Sacra, the Sacred Way in the summer of 71. The release of the Arch of Titus commemorates the victory of the Flavian Dynasty in the Jewish war of 66 to 74, which John's very nicely described previously. Josefa describes it as a war caused by radicals, and there's no reason to think otherwise. In fact, other Jews writing it just a few years later, said exactly the same thing. With the resulting destruction of Herod's spectacular temple in Jerusalem, they were part of a grand rebuilding of Rome under Vespasian and Titus, was continued under Titus's far more problematic brother Domitian, who not only built the arch, but was the last of the Flavian emperors. In fact, our arch is one of two that is known to have existed and that is dedicated to Titus in Rome, and it was part of a whole Flavian building process that included the nearby Temple of Peace, the Flavian amphitheater, otherwise know as the Colosseum, the baths of Titus, the Flavian Palace, and a rebuilt temple to Jupiter of the Capitoline. Iconography remembering the victory in Judea was central to the Flavian program, including wide distributions of coins celebrating Judea Capta. The expert on these coins claims that there are more Judea Capta coins than any other kind of coin from this period. This was serious propaganda. And the use of the tell-tale Judaean palm tree as symbol for the captured land. Even in the declaration of the Colosseum, and this is a coin that just came about. These things do happen in ancient history. New things show up. [INAUDIBLE] You can see it right there, little palm tree between the arches. The Temple of Isis, all of which is known is this relief. A little palm tree up above with a prisoner next to it. And the Flavian Tombs, which you can visit at the University of Michigan if you'd like. The Arch of Titus was a piece of this celebratory project. It was a huge construction made of imported marble from Greece. It contained three, this is a reconstruction drawing on the left and a model, a tourist piece, bought by, that's now located at Windsor Palace, from the turn of the nineteenth century. They're very similar actually. A bit too much gold if you've been to Vienna. This looks more like the Palaces of the Hapsburgs than ancient history, but at least it's not white. It contains three major reliefs. One showing Titus on his chariot. A second, Titus' ascension to the heavens. That's our scaffolding in 2012, there he is. He's very cute. Very well preserved, cuz it's way up there, where he becomes a god, of course. And finally, the famous relief of the spoils of Jerusalem. The second triumphal arch built for all to see in the Circus Maximus, the racetrack of ancient Rome, provides a really interesting inscription at least if the monk in the eighth century quoted it is to believed. This monk says as follows, the Senate and people of Rome dedicate this arch to the Emperor Titus, because with the Senate's advice and counsel and with help of others, he conquered the nation of the Jews. And destroyed Jerusalem which all of the general's kings and nations before him had either failed to do or even to attempt. That's patently wrong, but it makes no difference. He's making a claim for power for this upstart dynasty. The Arch of Titus bas reliefs and the long description of the triumphal parade of Titus in Josephus are the most significant evidence for Roman triumph in existence. Even as they are the most important visual testimony for the forms of sacred vessels of the Herodian Temple to have come down to us. They together are the most important sources for the study of the triumph. [MUSIC]",""

If we're Romans, in the first century, we'll see the glory of Rome. We'll see a city rebuilt after a crisis that precipitated with the death, the suicide, of the Emperor Nero in 69 CE. We'll see a year known as the Year of the Four Emperors, where one after another, different individuals took the reins of leadership and were deposed. We'll see a city that survived thanks to a dynasty led by a Roman general, named Vespasian. He would've brought back to Rome from the battles in Judea that began in 66, when the Jews revolted against the Pax Romana, the Roman Peace. We'll see the glory of Rome, the glory of the Emperor, a manifestation of our deepest religious and communal sentiments. If we were Jews, however, we'd see something very different. We'd see an imperial power that had taken our country beginning in the 60s BCE, that maintained its presence and tightened the vice. The result being that our culture splintered. And different sects within our culture had to figure out how to live under an imperial regime. Some choosing accommodation, some choosing rejection, and many stages in between. We'll see a revolt that erupted because of corrupt Roman governors, and because of Jews who couldn't find a way to live with the Roman reality. We'll see zealots who brought us to the edge of destruction and to destruction, and Romans who facilitated that destruction. We'll see the end of the temple in Jerusalem. And those are the two views that one would have seen in the first century looking at the Arch of Titus. Looking up at the beautiful marble of this triumphal arch. One of many buildings built by the family of Vespasian, his son Titus, and his second son Domitian, known as the Flavian Dynasty. The most famous of them we call the Colosseum, which we now know from an inscription was built with funds taken from the Jewish war. We'd see temples rebuilt. Two arches to Tidus, one of them just discovered in June of 2014. We'll see a place where Jews would see something very different from what Romans would see. Romans would see their triumph and Jews would see their destruction.",""

At the center of that empire was Judea. A unique kind of province in that Judeans, Jews, had a unique religious experience different than most others. This monotheistic notion and a sense of their own centrality to the divine plan. At the same moment, the Roman Empire was beginning to fall apart. The Emperor Nero, with great selfishness, was building pleasure palaces to his own glory, and in the year 69, committed suicide. The next year, known as the Year of the Four Emperors, was a moment of havoc in Rome, during the midst of which the Jewish community in Palestine continued a revolt begun in 66 against Rome. For both it was a disaster, the Jewish war of 66 to 74 pitting Jewish zealots who pulled the rest of the community into revolt against Rome into a death dance with Rome. Ultimately leading to the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in the year 70. The hero for Rome of that thwarted revolt was the general who was sent by Nero to fight in Judea, Vespasian, who was appointed emperor at the end of the Year of the Four Emperors, 69 AD, whose son then came forth and destroyed Jerusalem. In the summer, a vast triumphal parade took place in Rome commemorating the greatness of the new dynasty, the greatness and the renewal of Rome, and the destruction of Judea. For Jews, it became a period of mourning that really has not stopped to the very present for many.",""

Christians relatively early looked to the Arch of Titus, which has images of the parade of the artifacts of the Temple of Jerusalem into Rome. Look to the Arch of Titus. And in the Arch of Titus they saw confirmation of the prophecy that appears in the gospels in the mouth of Jesus, that for lack of belief in the coming transformations. Not one stone of the Jerusalem Temple will remain upon the other, which of course, soon after Jesus's crucifixion actually happened, the temple destroyed in the year 70. Jews continue to look at the Arch of Titus as a continuing sore, and in the modern period the Arch became for Jews, particularly after World War II, the equivalent of the arches that were at the entrance to concentration camps. The Arch of Titus as a place of horror, but also as a place in the modern world where Jews can claim that they came to Europe. And that they are among the earliest people in Europe, or alternately for Jews, fed up with Europe after a century of deep and difficult relations, culminating in the Holocaust, who are off to Palestine, who could say, all right we were brought here, and now, we're going home. Once an artifact becomes the symbol of a nation state however, the state of Israel beginning in 1949, it takes on a life of its own. The Arch of Titus, an artifact 2,000 years old, continues to spark emotions up to this day. And that's why it continues to be important. Yes, it's an important Roman artifact, it's an important Roman vowel relief but it continues to exist because Christians cared about it in the middle ages and it continues to be important because Jews and Christians continue to see in it a statement to a metaphor or an object that can help in their self understanding in the present.",""

And she said something they wouldn't say today, that's not art. Then I looked at her and she said, why don't you do something Jewish?

I like to say that I spend a lot of time figuring out what the ancient rabbis were like, what they looked like, what they smelled like, what they ate.

This monument has been a place where Romans celebrated their great victory, Jews lamented their horrific defeat and their exile. But in an astonishing turn, in the modern world, this arch became a place where Jewish identity looked to itself and said, look, we came to Europe. You can see us here coming to Europe. And then as Europe turned and life became less pleasant for Jews at the end of the 19th century, we're going home and taking our menorah with us.
