"AE4463","Advanced Aircraft Noise Modeling and Measurement","The course aims at providing the students with a solid background in the modelling and measurement of noise, with a focus on aircraft noise.
To ensure a high level of understanding of the matter taught the students will implement the majority of the techniques in dedicated assignments. The resulting suite of modelling and analysis techniques will be applied for realistic scenarios.

Introduction:
Introducing the students in the state-of-the-art capabilities, research issues and challenges in the modelling and measurement of aircraft noise.

The aircraft as a noise source:
The students will be taught about the basic mechanisms behind the noise produced by the aircraft engines and airframe.

Methods for simulating the aircraft noise:
A variety of methods exist for predicting the noise produced by aircraft. They range from high fidelity to empirical, each suited for their selected application. The students will be introduced in these approaches with a focus on the semi-emperical prediction methods and examples of applying the methods will be given.

Applications of methods for predicting the aircraft noise sources:
With the increasing pressure to reduce aircraft noise, huge efforts are put in ways to design quiet aircraft and flight procedures. The students will be provided with background and examples of such design efforts.
Within assignments, the students will implement models for some of the aircraft noise sources.

Theory of sound propagation:
For deriving the sound levels as received on the ground, the propagation through the atmosphere needs to be accounted for. The wave equation, governing the sound propagation will be introduced, together with other phenomena influencing the sound propagation such as the interaction of sound with the ground and sound absorption in air.

Models for sound propagation through the atmosphere:
Propagation models are developed in both the time as well as the frequency domain. Students are provided with examples of the theory, as used by these models, together with the implementation and its results. These models range from Transmission Line Matrix (TLM) methods, through Parabolic Equation (PE) methods and Ray Tracing (RT) methods. The atmospheric influence of wind and temperature gradients will be explained and higligthed in every model.
Throughout the lectures, assignments will be given in which elements of the noise propagation are implemented. The goal is to have a full propagation model finished at the end of the lectures.

Auralization:
Knowing the noise emitted by the aircraft and the propagation of the sound through the atmosphere, allows for a detailed assessment of the received signals. Auralization of the predicted signals provides the real experience of aircraft noise during a flyover.

Implementation in daily life:
For regulation purposes, the high-fidelity methods described in the course are approximated. The underlying merits and shortcomings of these approximations are briefly treated.

Noise measurement techniques:
Whereas a single microphone provides the total noise level, microphone arrays can be used for imaging the individual nosie sources, each contributing to the total noise level.
The basic technique for noise imaging is beamforming. The students will be introduced in the theory behind this technique and will implement their own algorithms. Noise measurements will be provided for testing the algorithms.","The course aims at providing the students with an understanding of:
- Theory and modelling of the aircraft as a noise source
- Theory and modelling of the propagation of sound through the atmosphere

"GEO1005","Spatial Decision Support for Planning and Crisis Management","Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) provide computerized assistance to decision-makers in development, evaluation and selection of alternatives for policies, plans, scenarios, projects or interventions where the problems have a geographic or spatial component. This refers to both long-term decision-making (e.g. planning for sustainable places, mitigating hazards, infrastructure management, and strategic business planning) and short-term time critical decisions such as emergency response and resource logistics. This course provides a basic knowledge on theoretical aspects of SDSS and concentrates on SDSS for two representative domains: urban planning and crisis management. While in urban planning the time span is months and years with the general goal of sustainable development, crisis management requires information and decisions in hours and the goal is saving human lives and limiting damages on property.

The course consists of three parts:

Space Syntax allows to analyse how the layout of the build environment influences the social, economic and environmental performance of places from the scale of the entire city to the scale of the individual street and building. Space syntax allows to measure the strength of spatial layouts, both existing and proposed, and to interpret how spatial layouts impact the way that people move, interact and transact in streets and buildings.

A geographic information system (GIS) is a tool that integrates hardware, software and data for capturing, managing, analysing, and displaying all forms of geographically referenced information. The GIS session focus each on different spatial aspects: demographical distribution, different forms of density and accessibility. Spatial research questions for all these aspects are developed and the students are introduced to the different tools that are provided by ArcGIS to investigate them.","The aim of this technology-based course is to underpin strategic design scenarios through using and developing representation and evaluation models.

The final project can be carried out within the framework of ongoing research at the university, within a company, within a research institute or at another university.
See also http://www.dcsc.tudelft.nl/Education/--> Graduation Guide.

This project also encompasses 2 formal colloquium presentations (Literature colloquium and Final Graduation colloquium) and 2 less formal MSc Workshop presentations. Next to these presentations the students have to attend 15 other student colloquia and 7 MSc Workshops (including those where they give their own presentations. Attendance is monitored.
MSc workshops are organized on the morning of each last Friday of the month (excl. July and August) and consist of 5-8 student presentations (10 minutes + 10 minutes discussion). Occasionally a presentation of an external speaker from industry with a systems and control background, is included. Colloquia sessions are organized throughout the year and are published on the DCSC website and communicated to 2nd year students by email.

The student will be supervised by a DCSC staff member, a company supervisor (if applicable) and often also by a PhD student.","The overall objective of this assignment is to demonstrate a sufficient academic level in the field of Systems and Control.

"SCP4510-11","Literature Assignment","The literature study is typically the initial phase of an MSc Thesis project (SCP4530-11), with the purpose to get acquainted with the scientific publications within the realm of the MSc-thesis project, and to prepare for the specific topics to be investigated. The student will need to search for recent publications (i.e. articles, theses, books) that are relevant for the particular thesis project. It is important to be very careful in judging the literature, since not everything written even in high-standard journals is useful - or even correct. In other words, one should be very critical and selective of which publications to use, and one should try to fully understand those that are relevant. See also
http://www.dcsc.tudelft.nl/Education/--> Graduation Guide for guidelines to perform literature searches.
Moreover the student needs to identify the current issues in his research area in order to avoid performing research on questions that have already been resolved in the literature.
Once some well-motivated choices have been made on what is planned to be to investigated, these are summarized in a report. This will then form the basis for the subsequent MSc-project work.
At the end of the literature survey period the student has to orally report on the findings of the survey, by means of a formal 20-25 minutes MSc-colloquium presentation (see also SCP4500-11)","The study goals of the literature study are:
o The student is able to search for/identify publications that are relevant to a specific research question
o The student is able to create an accurate overview of the state of the art for a specific research question

"UD1017","Innovation Lab","Create a vision and idea for the happy city of the future. That will be the brief of the InnovationLab for 24 honours students from Leiden University, TU Delft and Erasmus University Rotterdam. The InnovationLab is set up as a weekly open studio session in workshop-setting in which researchers, students and famous thinkers come together, and thus bridge the gap between students, PhD's, professors and start-ups. The Lab co-operates with the Delft Institute for Positive Design (www.diopd.org).

To meet the basic human needs such as shelter, medical care and safety, contemporary cities are looking for collective solutions. Higher, more abstract needs like appreciation, meaning and creativity, however, are merely seen as ones own responsibility, for which you can seek help from a psychologist or coach if desired. In the InnovationLab we experiment with collective ways to facilitate happiness in the city of the future, whereby we rely on research in sociology, economy, psychology, philosophy of technology, urbanism, industrial design (positive design) and socio-economic transitions.

Are you ready for this multidisciplinary challenge? Do you master the Dutch and English language? Do you look across borders and do you want to meet students, innovative start-ups, professors and PhD's from other universities and work together on a feasible idea for the happy city of the future? Then send a letter of motivation with your picture attached to robbertjan@hpinnovationlab.nl and stella@hpinnovationlab.nl. Describe in max 500 words what challenges you see in the current city and with which type of solutions you think the happy city of the future could be realised.

"WM0820TU","Responsible Innovation, introduction","Today technology has become a main determinant of the quality of life of individuals and the quality of society. New technologies contribute to human well-being, but they may also introduce considerable risks to humans, the environment and future generations. We therefore have every reason to ascertain that the new technologies we develop as a society respect the values we hold dear. Various governments, companies and research funding agencies have now recognized this need for responsible innovation. Responsible innovation can, as a concept, be understood in a more substantive and in a more procedural sense. As a procedural notion, responsible innovation refers to a process of innovation that meets certain procedural norms, like accountability (to stakeholders and to society) and transparency. As a substantive notion, responsible innovation refers to a process of innovation which results in certain products, i.e. innovative technologies, which reflect important moral values. This includes values like, health, safety, human welfare, sustainability, justice, inclusiveness, democracy, privacy, trust, and autonomy.

In this introductory course we will use the MOOC 'Responsible Innovation', which is created by the Ethics & Philosophy of Technology section of the department of the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management of Delft University of Technology. In 7 weeks we will discuss the different chapters this MOOC offers. Each week different students will prepare a presentation and discussion for the whole group.
Next to the MOOC, students are introduced to a collaborative research platform on which all students have to publish a column each week. This platform is available throughout the minor for students to share research and collaborate. In a special workshop collaborative research using the Ginger Platform is offered.","After this course, students should be able to:

- understand and be able to explain the various theories on -and dimensions of- responsible innovation
- recognise instances of responsible and irresponsible innovation
- discuss and assess (the ethical and societal implications of) real-life cases at the hand of theories pertaining to responsible innovation
- apply tools and approaches to responsible innovation, like Value Sensitive Design, to their own innovation efforts.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35073&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"WM0927TU","Intercultural Internship","The internship takes place in a developing country preferably in a company, NGO or any other international or intercultural context. The questions to be dealt with can relate to design problems, policy decisions or, in general, Science, Technology and Society issues. The students are required to connect their experiences in their practical assignments to Technology Dynamics approaches, especially in terms of socio-technical systems, technological regimes and/or innovation systems. They should in addition be able to assess the influence of cultural differences on the management of technology and policy issues. There should be a mutual exchange and influence of TPM approaches and the actual problems and tasks, which the internship implies. The internship aims at the integration of knowledge and experience in the personal capacities of the students and the integration of a diversity of theoretical tools in view of practical problems and situations. Such an exchange between theory and practice should both fine-tune conceptual and theoretical approaches and put practical questions in such a perspective.","The students are able:
1. to work on sociotechnical problems,

"WM0369TU","Philosophy of the human being and technology","The nature, possibilities and limitations of the human greatly affect economy and law, as well as technological developments. Technology takes over ever more 'higher' functions of the human. In the past mechanical devices and electricity saved on physical labour and human energy. Today computers increasingly are replacing routine aspects of thinking; and in laboratories researchers are investigating whether also 'higher' functions of the mind, such as cognition, consciousness and morality, can be replaced with the help of the life sciences, ICT, pharmacology and nanotechnology.

This course addresses certain philosophical questions that have consequences for technological development, economy and law, questions such as: What is a human being? What is (personal) identity? Which cultural (including technological) and/or natural features constitute human nature? How is the human being different from (other) animals? How do technological developments affect the autonomy of humans and the way they shape their life? These questions will be investigated from different perspectives, such as classical ontology and epistemology (Aristotle, Descartes), German Idealism (Kant, Hegel), historical materialism (Marx), existentialism and phenomenology (Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre), and philosophy of technology (Ellul, Gehlen, Ihde, Clark). Philosophers who believe that the human is an autonomous being with inherent capacities such as rationality and freedom often warn against the destructive influence of technology on the human mind and its products, i.e., on culture, science, morality, self-determination. Philosophers who understand the human as a being who throughout history has always constituted him or herself by virtue of technical aids and artefacts often see in emerging technologies new opportunities for the human. The German idealism of Hegel, for example, conceives autonomy and emancipation as a challenge that cannot be met on individual level but rather only by virtue of active participation in a society that has to secure social, economical and political conditions. From this perspective also technologies could contribute to realizing freedom.","Learning goals: insight in
 different perspectives on the nature and condition of the human
 implications and consequences of those perspectives for the evaluation of the influence of technology on humans and their capacities, values and norms

Competences:
 explicating and critically analysing arguments in theories and debates (for example the human enhancement debate) on the influence of technology on humans and society
 recognizing and identifying (new) problems and (new) opportunities that (emerging) technologies accompany for humans and the way they interact with one another

"WM0629TU","Integration economics, law, philosophy and technology","How can one design effective public policies that are intended to modify the behaviour of persons and firms? What does it mean for a firm to make the best investment decision if it does not have complete information about what its competitors will do? The present course aims at introducing mathematical and logical tools for analyzing these and other situations, and at putting them to use for clarifying and making explicit the key notions needed for this analysis. Strategies, epistemic game theory, judgment aggregation, dynamic and probabilistic updates are among the specific topics covered by this course. They will be introduced in the context of concrete case studies arising in the study of the economic and legal aspects of technological innovation.


- Lectures, tutorials, literature and exercises will be in *English*.
- This course will be challenging, given its interdisciplinary nature, its mix of conceptual and technical topics, and its draw on high-level skills such as abstraction, analysis, synthesis and conceptualization. Because of this, *class attendance* is of the essence, and is made *obligatory*. It is permitted to students to be absent to only one session of the course without justification.
- All specifications of the format for the final assignment are to be abided by.
- The *deadline* for the final assignment is *strict*. Final assignments are to be handed in via Blackboard.","This course aims at familiarizing the students with the use of formal tools in the analysis of economic and legal aspects of technological innovation. These tools clarify and make explicit notions (such as strategic thinking, aggregation, dynamics) which are key both to the economic and the legal side of the analysis, and hence provide the common ground for the integration of these disciplines. By using these tools, the students will gain a formal and mathematically grounded grasp on concepts which are very influential to the real-life thinking patterns in law and economics.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35071&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"SPM5710","Integrative regional development","Regional development is understood as the overall socio-economic and spatial development of a region. It results from a complex interplay of a variety of socio-economic, cultural, environmental, ecological and spatial processes as well as policy making at a variety of scales. Hence, the development of a region can only be understood in terms of multi-actor and multi-level processes in specific institutional contexts. Therefore the effectiveness of dedicated governance strategies depends on, amongst others, governance models, available instruments, measures, regional characteristics and contextual developments. What works in one region is not necessarily effective in another.
A main challenge lies in the coordination of various interests, both public and private, and the creation of synergies. It is about mobilising stakeholders and creating shared identities. Finding the right balance between formal and informal approaches and between coordination and involvement on the one hand and leaving development to the market on the other is a key aspect.
A complicating factor is that it is often unclear what exactly constitutes a region. Political delimitations usually do not correspond with functional boundaries. In a functional sense often one cannot speak of one region, but rather of several overlapping and intersecting functional spaces, such as, for example, water systems or labour markets, each of which having its own spatial scale.
This course will address a variety of integrative regional development strategies. In addition several techniques and approaches, both technological and non-technological, will be offered to design integrative regional development strategies. Students will be offered a range of theoretical and practical knowledge and will by means of various assignments and tasks be challenged to apply and reflect on this knowledge.","The central objective of this course is to be able to assess the appropriateness of integrative regional development strategies in a variety of territorial and institutional contexts and to be able to develop approaches and recommendations for developing such strategies.

"SPM9750","Environmental Sustainability in the Built Environment","The course is aimed at students, who want to deepen their knowledge of sustainable buildings (zero-energy buildings) and the processes involved in their development.
The course is based on a system modeling approach, in which the relationship between energy needs and energy conversion, environmental impacts and health impacts, life cycle costing and process management are treated.
The course starts with the building process, its organization and the role of different actors in master plans and pre-design phases. It includes:

 asset management and life cycle costing,
 'sustainable' contracting and participation of diverse stakeholders,
 governance and regulation items important for the process

After that, design strategies for the reduction of the environmental impact of buildings are discussed and two main aspects are deepened: energy and environmental impacts. It includes:

 how to influence the energy need in buildings by smart designs,
 the options for sustainable energy conversion and how it relates to building design,
 the environmental impacts of energy consumption,
 the environmental impacts of material consumption and how it relates to the impacts of energy consumption and to the building design,
 the ways buildings can positively or negatively influence the health of occupants.

The course id organized around a group project with a real client, generally an housing association or a municipality. The project is about the sustainable renovation of a building. The theoretical knowledge acquired during the classes is applied in order to make the building as sustainable as possible within predefine budget constraints.","At the end of the course, students:
- know what design and process-oriented strategies can be applied to come to sustainable buildings
- know how to apply these strategies in building design (costing, contracting, participation)
- understand the 'building system' and are able to identify the main relationships between construction, energy use, building use and environmental impacts
- know how to make well-founded estimates (calculations, simulations) of energy use and environmental impacts
- know how to come to low/zero energy buildings, energy producing buildings and low or zero environmental impact buildings.
- are able to design a program of requirements for the (re)development of an environmentally sustainable building and to assess policy reports, master plans and pre-design studies in this field.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35206&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"SPM4710","Design of spatial concepts","This course focuses on spatial concepts as a design tool for regional integrative development. Examples of common spatial concepts are brainport Eindhoven, greenport, mainport and development corridor. Spatial concepts, visions and, more generally, conceptualizations of the spatial surrounding play an important role in policy design and implementation. Spatial concepts give direction to place-based development policies by connecting multiple stakeholders, processes at various spatial scales and evolving developments in time. They help in aligning policy instruments and assist in creating favourable institutional conditions for effective policy implementation.
Spatial concepts are applied at all spatial scales: from local (i.e. Amsterdam South Axis, business park, water front), to regional (i.e. ecological connections, urban networks, Mainport Schiphol), national (spatial main structure, ecological main structure) and even transnational or European (EU Transport corridors, global economic integration zones, Rhine river basin).
Another example of the use of spatial concepts concerns spatial positioning, i.e. conceptualising one's own position within a wider spatio-economic or socio-cultural context, which provides a rationale for local place-based development policies.
By systematically addressing the five dimensions of spatial concepts, i.e. the cognitive, communicative, normative, institutional and instrumental dimension, this course will outline a variety of techniques and strategies, both technological and non-technological, in order to achieve desired spatial and institutional structures. Students will be offered a range of theoretical and practical knowledge and will by means of various assignments and tasks be challenged to work with spatial concepts and reflect on them.","This course enables students to recognize, operationalize and apply spatial concepts, as used in integrative regional development strategies.

After this course the student
- Knows the main functions of spatial concepts and can identify and interpret the impact of such concepts in planning and design;
- Is able to explain the historical context for the Dutch policy framework for spatial planning and the key spatial concepts through time;
- Is able to analyse spatial plans in terms of the spatial images used, the concepts applied, the related (hidden) agendas, and the relevance for stakeholders;
- Is able to analyse and conceptualise existing or desired spatial structures through interpretation of maps and data and do so on different levels of scale;
- Is able to reflect and discuss interactively in a group setting on academic literature and to individually write reports.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35186&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

In this project, students combine and apply theory on design, on systems engineering, institutional design and process design.

The main purpose of this project is twofold.
In terms of content, we aim for an integrated design,including
 the technical structure of the system, in relation to its environment
 the institutional structure, in relation to the technical system and institutional environment
 game rules and time-line to be followed in decision-making processes as related to either planning, implementation, or operation of the technical and institutional structures.
 a process design to organize stakeholders involved with one or more phases of the system's life cycle.

In terms of design process, we want students to complete the full cycle of a design process, from idea to basic design and including the making of a 'proof of concept' and reflection. A final report discloses the results of the project and is submitted for grading.","To fulfill the requirement of the course, a student has given proof of being able to conduct and reflect on a series of design activities, starting with an initial problem statement and completed with presentation of a basic, integrated design.

"SPM4133","Designing MAS from an Actor Perspective","Designing for interventions in multi-actor systems requires a deep understanding of the behaviour of the actors, the games they play, the processes they are in and the institutions that guide their behaviour. This course draws on four main theoretical domains.

First of all, we study decision-making in multi-actor systems (i.e. networks). What is their nature? What kind of actor behaviour can be found in these networks? What rules and strategies can deal with the nature of networks?

Second, we look at process management and process design as a way of managing actor behaviour within the networks, in particular contrast to a traditional 'project approach' for decision-making. We also discuss the nature of strategic behaviour in processes.

Third, we focus on games and game theory. What does a more formal analysis of actors and their decision problems teach us?

Fourth, we focus on institutions and institutional design. How do institutions shape and constrain behaviour of actors? What is the nature of institutions? How do they evolve? Can we design institutions? Institutional design is aimed at influencing the institutional setting of multi-actor systems. We explore institutions from an economic and a socio-political perspective.

After lecturing on theory, analysis and design of networks, processes, games and institutions, what has been learned will be combined and applied to real-life problems in multi-actor systems. Students will set foot in practical application by means of four ways: interactive workshops on a real-life case, an essay assignment, a design assignment and simulations in which students negotiate and manage multi-actor systems in socio-technical context (see also SPM7020).","The general purpose is to learn about the dynamics of multi-actor systems within complex socio-technical settings in order to influence these dynamics. Different but complementary theoretical perspectives are taught to analyze and influence actor behavior in networks. The course thoroughly discusses theories on networks, games, processes and institutions. These perspectives are used to understand actor behavior on a deeper level and to design for processes, networks, games and institutions that enable decision-makers to improve collective performance of multi-actor systems.

At the end of this course, students will be able to
 explain why actors in networks behave as they do and how their behavior may evolve
 describe different network structures and their practical implications
 identify what institutions are at work and how they change over time
 select what theory to use for what type of design problem in multi-actor systems
 combine an analysis of actors, networks, games, institutions & processes
 organize for a design process based on design requirements and design principles

Because of the internet's global and apparently borderless design, complicated legal issues arise. For example, whose laws apply in cyberspace? Which country has jurisdiction over crimes committed on the internet? And how do we attribute actions to users on the internet? Both end users, law enforcement, governments and businesses are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations on the internet, but the needs of each are different. Hence, technology designers must be aware of the legal frameworks within which they create new services and infrastructures for each of these parties. What's more, each technological design also has legal consequences  it may affect existing rights and freedoms in a positive or negative way. Think of, e.g. the protection of privacy or freedom of speech.

"SPM9730","Sustainable Innovation and Transitions","The course Sustainable Innovation and Transitions takes as starting points:
(1) that technology and innovation on the one hand and society and users on the other hand mutually influence one another and evolve in a co-evolutionary way;
(2) that sustainable innovations, as well as system innovations and transitions towards sustainability are strongly needed to bring about sustainability, and;
(3) that stakeholder involvement and participatory intervention instruments are needed and required to enable and realise implementation in a socially responsible way.

The course evolves in particular around the concepts of Functions of Innovation Systems, Strategic Niche Management, and Socio-Technical Regimes, Sustainability Transitions and sustainable business models. These frameworks and instruments can be applied to sustainable innovations, which can be a technical innovation (e.g. metal biogas), an organisational innovation (e.g. car sharing), or a bottom-up grassroots innovation (e.g. energy cooperatives, urban agriculture) in both industrialised and developing countries. In addition, intervention instruments like transition management and backcasting are part of the course.

The course consists of three parts:
(1) A theoretical part consisting of lectures, readings and discussions.
(2) A group assignment focusing on a self-chosen topic. Examples of systems that can be studied include regional eco-industrial parks, organic agriculture, sustainable mobility systems and renewable energy innovation systems in both industrialised and developing countries. In the group assignment (i) a brief technology assessment & stakeholder analysis is made before (ii) conducting a more elaborate analysis of the system with either the functions of innovation systems approach or the strategic niche management approach, and (iii) making recommendations how to extend the current niche.
(3) An individual assignment in which an implementation proposal can be made using one of the intervention & implementation instruments dealt with in the course.","By the end of the course students have:

"SPM9239","Responsible innovation","Today, technology has become a main determinant of the quality of life of individuals and the quality of society. New technologies contribute to human well-being, but they may also introduce considerable risks to humans, the environment and future generations. We therefore have every reason to ascertain that the new technologies we develop as a society respect the values we hold dear. Various governments, companies and research funding agencies have now recognized this need for responsible innovation. Responsible innovation can, as a concept, be understood in a more substantive and in a more procedural sense. As a procedural notion, responsible innovation refers to a process of innovation that meets certain procedural norms, like accountability (to stakeholders and to society) and transparency. As a substantive notion, responsible innovation refers to a process of innovation which results in certain products, i.e. innovative technologies, which reflect important moral values. This includes values like, health, safety, human welfare, sustainability, justice, inclusiveness, democracy, privacy, trust, and autonomy.

In this course we will discuss the concept of responsible innovation and how it might be understood. We will discuss tools and approaches to responsible innovation, like Value Sensitive Design (VSD), Constructive Technology Assessment (CTA), Midstream Modulation (MM), and Network Approach for Moral Evaluation (NAME). We will address the possibilities and challenges for responsible innovation at four different levels: 1) the level of specific R&D projects, 2) the level of companies (and the relation between responsible innovation and corporate social responsibility (CSR), 3) the level of technological sectors and 4) the activities of governments and funding agencies.

"EPA2942","Master thesis EPA","The Master's Thesis Project takes place at the end of the second year and covers a period of approximately half a year. Students have to carry out an individual project to round off the EPA program. The subject for the project may be chosen in respect to, or independent from, a specific area of technology and possible elective profile, though students are stimulated to find some connectivity in their choices.

Within this project, students must demonstrate their capacity for academic analysis, synthesis, design, reflection and written communication on a particular issue in the field of engineering and policy analysis.

The student can start the Master's Thesis Project after at least two members of the thesis committee have approved the (draft) project proposal.

The student starts with an orientation phase that will lead to a detailed Master Thesis Project Proposal. After 3 and before 5 weeks of orientation the student presents this Thesis Project Proposal to his/her graduation committee during a kick-off meeting. The Master Thesis Project Proposal should give information on the goal of the project, the main research/design question, a set of derived sub questions/goals that give meaning to the project, data to use/collect, methods planned to be used, and a detailed project planning. After a successful kick-off meeting the student may start with the actual execution of the Thesis Project. During the kick-off meeting, the kick-off form has to be filled in, signed by the members of the graduation committee and handed in at the service point.

During the project the student will work towards the results of the thesis project and a compilation of project documents that the student will use to write a thesis report. The thesis committee or the student may organize one or more mid-term meetings to guide the progress of the project.

When the project is almost finished a green-light meeting is held [green light meeting]. During this meeting the student can get a green light to organize his or her final thesis project defense. This means a formal approval from the administration for graduation office (100% of the courses completed except for the graduation project) and approval with respect to the contents of the work (compilation of project documents in which research questions are addressed, and a high level draft version of thesis report). The work should at least be sufficient to pass without any adjustment, but of course expected improvements on both thesis project results and the masters thesis report as suggested by the thesis committee should be considered to be incorporated.

The student finalizes the thesis project in respect to the agreements made during the green light meeting. During the final defense meeting the student gives a presentation to defend the final project results. If all results, including the defense and presentation, are sufficient the diploma and final grade for the thesis project as a whole will be handed out. Students are required to make the thesis report available in both paper and digital copy.

More detailed and essential information about the Master's Thesis Project can be found in the TPM Graduation Portal, where all administrative procedures and requirements for the master thesis project are presented.","The EPA Master's thesis project has the following four objectives:
1) The student has to plan and fulfill a Master Thesis Project on their own;
2) The students passes through all phases of academic research and/or design;
3) The project is a bridge between the EPA curriculum and working as an EPA engineer;
4) The project is an orientation on the labor market and the field of work of the EPA engineer.

The work reports on improving the quality of decision-making in policy processes regarding large-scale technical systems e.g. for transport, ict, enery, water and industrial innovation, while taking into account the socio-economic and/or political environment in which they are embedded.
For EPA the following criteria would be considered to indicate a 'typical' EPA thesis:

"WM4003TU","Additional Entrepreneurship Annotation Final Thesis","The specific content of the Entrepreneurship Annotation Final Thesis is to be defined together with the student and his/her supervisors in advance off the thesis period. However, a few guidelines for the structure of the work to be undertaken are:
1. The thesis theme should be directly related with the subject of the student's Master Thesis. The relevance of the Entrepreneurship Annotation Final Thesis to the overarching Master Thesis should be clear;
2. The student should choose a clear focus on either 'Starting your own Company' or 'Corporate Entrepreneurship'. The final product of the thesis should embody this focus (business plan or feasibility report);
3. The subject of the Final Thesis should reflect the ambition of the student and his/her interest in entrepreneurship;
4. In the case of a 'Corporate Entrepreneurship' focus, thesis themes should be directly linked to the context of an existing company. Ideally, the entrepreneurship thesis should be performed within the company;
5. In the case of a focus on 'Starting your own Company', thesis themes should be directly linked to the context of starting a new company. Ideally, the student should place himself as the entrepreneur willing to start a company with the technology at hand either right after graduation or later. The thesis could also be conducted as part of an already existing start-up, in cooperation with YES!Delft;
6. Students need to prepare a plan for their Entrepreneurship Annotation Final Thesis, including the timing and work to be developed for the phases of literature review, field research, analysis and reporting. This plan should be reviewed by both the Entrepreneurship supervisor and the Master thesis supervisors. Students will be assessed on basis of this planning and its execution. A template for this plan is available from the DCE supervisors;
7. Some examples of thesis themes are:
- Technological feasibility and integration. This includes a feasibility study for implementing and using the technology in a practical setting;
- Business incubation. Developing a business case for creating a new business unit within an existing company, based on the technology at hand;
- Business improvement. Developing a business case for adjusting the product offer or business model of an existing company, based on the technology at hand;
- Market study. Conducting an in-depth analysis of market potential for the technology;
- Licensing analysis, which includes the valuation and associated business model for a technology within the context of a licensing deal for a particular company;
- Investment analysis. The student conducts an investment analysis for a given technology, including investment needs for development, prototyping, testing and manufacturing;
- Intellectual Property (IP) due diligence. This encompasses a due diligence analysis on existing IP potentially in conflict with the technology at hand;
- Competitor analysis. An in-depth analysis of existing alternative or substitute solutions potentially competing with the technology.
- Life Cycle Analyses (LCA), with a view to evaluating products for their ecological sustainability. The emphasis is on carrying out an LCA in practice and demonstrating the practical use of this method.","The Entrepreneurship Annotation Final Thesis aims to develop and apply the skills and knowledge on entrepreneurship of students enrolled in the Master Annotation Entrepreneurship Program. The student applies all the knowledge and skills that he/she learned during the Annotation Entrepreneurship to a business problem related to the overarching Master Thesis, and shows an entrepreneurial attitude in tackling this problem.
The Entrepreneurship Annotation Final Thesis should be seen as a complement to the overarching Master Thesis. The underlying idea is to make a bridge between the technical aspects, examined in the student's Master Thesis, and business aspects of the technology/subject of the Master Thesis. The ability to make this connection is at the heart of technology-based entrepreneurship. Together with the supervisors of the overarching Master Thesis and the Entrepreneurship Annotation Final Thesis, students should clearly understand the application context and the reasons for bringing the specific technology to the market.
The thesis, like the whole annotation program, can be focused on two main areas: 'Starting your own Company' and 'Corporate Entrepreneurship'. By the end of the Entrepreneurship Annotation Final Thesis, students should be able to:
 Understand the practical business aspects of bringing a technology to the market (in either a corporate setting or in a new start-up);
 Estimate a (potential) market and derive pricing strategies from this analysis.
 Draw up the cost structure of a product or service and translate this into the accompanying financial statements.
 Further develop their insights into what their motivations, ambitions and objectives are as entrepreneurs (in either a corporate setting or in a new start-up);
 Be able to report their findings in a well-readable and attractive format, which should be easy to understand for decision makers;
 Present their findings in the form of a short 'elevator pitch', so that decision makers understand the value of the concept and are motivated to know more about it.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=34737&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"WM0944TU","Sustainable Innovation in Practice","The course 'Sustainable Technical Innovation in Practice' is designed for students that really want to have a sustainability impact and want to get something done.
The main aim of the course is to design, build (a model) and pilot sustainable innovations based on research or education projects from TU Delft; or based on concrete questions from practice. Knowledge and experience from different disciplines has to be translated into designs that have to be put to the test, evaluated and presented to a wider audience.
The course is originally created for the design and building of D-exto at a Day of Wonder, the Green Village, MadNes, Welcome to the Future, the MooiWeerSpelen and potentially other festivals that are triggered by the concept of D-exto: https://www.facebook.com/TUDelftDuurzaamPaviljoen.
You can also use the course to perform projects on the TU campus for example as part of a student association (Energy Club; Ecolution; Sustainability Community; etc.) or companies such as Schiphol (theGrounds). Or just compose your own interdisciplinary group and join any time during the year.

TU Delft strives to play a prominent representative role in presenting sustainable innovations to the public, with other universities, scientific institutions and business enterprises as collaborators. The goal is to create a appealing technical designs or applications that invite visitors to interact, thereby provoking thought and motivating change in lifestyle  not forced but positively triggered.

SECOND or THIRD quarter (of if you have a team, any time a year).
From 2015-2016 on the course is condensed into 1 quarter (instead of 2 or 3). This means
The FIRST month you will translate the concept of sustainability together with a chosen challenge into a concept and design
The SECOND month you will build your first prototype(s)
The THIRD month you will build the product you want to bring with D-exto to festivals and test whether it works.

The product you build or activity/workshop you design to interact with visitors on festivals will have to be tested and evaluated on at least two festivals. One in Delft  like a day of Wonder of MooiWeerSpelen - and one outside Delft  like MadNes or Welcome to the Village.

SUMMERSCHOOL 2015
From 2015 on we will organize a pressure cooking summerschool directly designing and building solutions for the challenges the festivals face. By traveling 4 different festivals and working together with professionals. So, if you have most of 25 June to 20 July free this summer join the course and have the most creative and fun festival ever. This means you will be prototyping on the spot and join D-exto on MooiWeerSpelen, MadNes, Welcome to the Village and Over het IJ.

NOT JUST FESTIVALS

"WM0804TU","Project Safety Science (6 ects)","This module is designed for students who wish to plunge more deeply into a study of a particular safety issue or risk control problem than is possible with the module wm0801. It is normal to combine this module with work in preparation for a final graduation project, or to link it to work for an industrial internship period, a design project from the student's own faculty, or other part of the degree course which throws up a specifically definable safety issue requiring study.

Based on a proposal from the student the course leader assigns a staff member from the Safety Science group who assists the student in defining the topic and approach to be used and the questions to be answered by the project report. This person also guides the student in finding appropriate literature and other material or access to it. The central objective is that the student gains experience in defining and (re)solving a specific safety issue and in presenting and defending the findings against a cross-examination by the responsible lecturer/assessor.

The topic of the study can be freely chosen within the areas of knowledge and competence of the members of the Safety Science Group. The following is an illustrative, but not necessarily limitative, list of topics on which the staff and PhD students of the group are currently working:
1. Risk Modelling for design and management
2. Incorporation of risk criteria into the design process
3. Disaster prevention and management
4. The learning organisation as manager of risk
5. Risk regulation
6. Disaster management and security

More details on the possible topics can be found on the wm0804 blackboard site. You can otherwise contact the module manager.","After this study the student possesses:

* A deep insight into the safety (and/or health) of one specific area, activity or system, chosen in discussion with the course team.
* Practice in presenting an analysis of the chosen safety aspect in a coherent, well-argued and critical report, which can stand the test of an oral examination.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35227&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"EPA1412","Project Management","Management of Public Projects

This course is about the Project Management (PM) of public projects, which are large engineering projects, often about infrastructure, with government and the public among the important stakeholders. Government will often be the client. The course covers generic PM, in a series of lectures in Q3 shared with two other PM courses, and the specifics of PM in public projects, such as the public as stakeholder, decision making in a political context, public-private partnerships and the transition phase (the deployment of the project result) of public projects.
The specific part of the course takes place in the form of weekly seminars

Subjects covered in the general PM lectures (taking place in Q3):
1 Kick-off, introduction to Project Management
2. Guest lecture on a large engineering project, such as the Delft Rail Tunnel
3. Systems Engineering and Project Management
4. Fundamentals of Planning, Scope, Time, Cost, Quality
5. Risk Management, qualitatively and quantitatively, with guest lecture
6. Project Organization and Team Work
7. Stakeholder management, with guest lecture
8. International aspects of projects
9. Contractting and Procurement
10. Decision making and Portfolio management
11. Succes criteria and success factors.
12. Summary and Q&A.

The seminar, in Q3 and Q4, will have the form of group assignments and student presentations, focusing on the specifics of Public Projects, as mentioned above.
The group assignments deal with analysing project cases and doing research in public project management.","The course aims at providing knowledge and skills for different roles in public projects, such as project manager, either within government, or within contractor working for government clients, or policy consultant, advising project managers and decision makers about public projects.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35129&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

These questions can be related to ethically sensitive policy decisions, design problems, related to methodological questions or to the relation of society and science/philosophy as such. The students are required to connect their experiences in these practical assignments to ethical, social and philosophical approaches and theories. There should be a mutual exchange and influence, and integration of TPM approaches, philosophical approaches and the actual problems and tasks, which such an internship implies. The project aims at integration of knowledge and experience in the personal capacities of the students and integration of a diversity of theoretical tools with practical problems and situations. Such an exchange between theory and practice should both fine-tune theoretical approaches and put practical questions in a conceptual perspective.","1.

Also methodologies for 'research through design' are explored to help students to prepare for the field trip. The notions of design trajectories, boundary objects and scenario building are explored. To this end students will work in the editorial Ginger platform, for allowing students to share their research and reflect upon it. As result a project plan is constituted in the Ginger platform in which knowledge from all modules is applied and preliminary 'research through design' is shown.
During the field trip some supervisors and students keep on working in the Ginger Platform and publish their findings, ongoing research and design on a weekly basis to share with other students and stakeholders. For these students the final assessment is given on the basis of the publications in Ginger. Other students agree with their supervisors to make regular reports sent by email and write a concluding report at the end.","1. to apply insight and knowledge of the different modules of the minor International Entrepreneurship for Development, consistently and creatively

"WM0365TU","Technology and the Future of Humanity","Are we good enough? If not, what may we do to improve ourselves? And how may we do that? In the past, human enhancement was foremost allied to physical or intellectual exercise. In the last three decades, human enhancement has become more and more associated with a large and ever expanding assortment of cutting-edge technologies: technologies that might radically extend the human lifespan, reconstruct bodily parts, enable cloning, or increase cognitive performance.
In social-ethical discussions about human enhancement, one can detect a fault line developing between, on the one side, bioconservatives who warn us for all the dangers and risks of technological enhancement and, on the other side, trans- and posthumanists who vividly depict all the great advantages of human enhancement.

Whether human enhancement is found ethically permissible is to a high degree dependent on what is considered as human nature. Bioconservatives, who are often inclined to give high normative weight to what they sometimes call the 'wisdom of nature,' consider tempering with human traits and boundaries soon enough violation of a 'species integrity,' which is risky enough to justify the application of the precautionary principle. Transhumanists, in contrast, who often conceive (human) nature as something that has evolved in response to an enormous array of environmental contingencies and stochastic genetic events, claim that it cannot tells us anything about what is good or desirable in terms of the traits humans should possess.

In this course we will investigate the presuppositions of bioconservatives and transhumanists regarding human nature from different perspectives: 1) we will discuss new developments in research of human enhancement that shed a different light on what human nature is (Habermas, Fukuyama, Bostrom, More); 2) we will discuss philosophical texts that problematize the view of both bioconservatives and transhumanst regarding human nature and human enhancement (Nietzsche, Gehlen, Plessner, Sloterdijk); 3) we will examine to what extent the presuppositions of bioconservatives and transhumansts are influenced by a) humanist and b) Christian conceptions of human nature and human enhancement.","insight in the current debate regarding human enhancement; philosophical analysis of the presuppositions in this debate; insight in humanist and Christian motives in this debate","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35222&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

Course manager: Dr Jelle de Boer
In this course students gain insight into current key research frontiers at TPM, research that elucidates the many ways in which technology, policy and management can be entangled. There will be 7 sessions with 7 different TPM researchers from various subfields (see below; depending availability changes may be made).
Each session contains two parts: (A) a content part which focusses on the ideas and theory of the relevant research, and (B) a process part which focusses on how the researcher has worked towards his aims.
5 x Academic article. Five sessions, with one researcher each, will be devoted to (A) an in-depth discussion of a paper (plus relevant background material) by the researcher himself has been published in a journal of good reputation, a paper they are especially proud of, and that they believe will set a good example for the TPM graduate students. The second part (B) is about the process towards publication, i.e. most notably about the choice of journal to submit, the review reports, and how to deal with these.
1 x Phd thesis. In one session, a recently graduated TPM researcher will (A) discuss key material from his own thesis. In the second part (B) the scholar will tell how his thesis has come abouthow he made plans, executed them or failed to execute them, about typical pitfalls of doing PhD research and how they might be avoided, and other tips.
1 x Research proposal. How to receive a research grant? This session concerns writing a research proposal in order to obtain funding. In part (A) the TPM researcher will exchange views about the subject matter of one of his successful proposals and why he found the leading ideas promising. In part (B) the researcher makes clear what are good tactics for applying for funding.

During this course you are supposed to write four reports of each 1000 - 1500 words in which you report on the lecture and the corresponding literature: the central elements of the substantive part and its aims, and the most useful ideas concerning the process part (max. 20% of the paper). There are 7 sessions in total. You may choose yourself about which sessions are going to write reports. (But I would strongly recommend to write one about the first session). You, as aspiring scholars, should not just plainly summarize but also critically reflect on the lecture and the readings. Furthermore, try to write these reports with a broad audience in mind, as if a serious magazine could publish it. I will grade the reports. Grades: A good  very good); B (satisfactory) or C (unsatisfactory). Getting a C implies rewriting the report. An A means that both the content of the report is good and also that it is a good read. I will provide general and sometimes individual feedback on the reports.","Get acqainted with TPM research: the content & process of publishing academic work

"WM0338TU","Identity in a Technological Culture","Who are we? What are we? Are we the same person throughout our lives? Are we our bodies? Are we our minds? Are we our brains? Are we our experiences? These questions still land us in great difficulties and confusion. Common sense and traditional philosophical thinking, strongly determined by Aristotle, proceed from the assumption that we have a durable and independent essence that fixes our nature. Although we change continuously, there must be something that remains the same and secures that we do not fall apart. This view has been radically criticized in modern philosophy. Nietzsche, for example, argues that there is nothing in our body or mind that remains the same. We are not one person but rather a multitude of characters that are continuously constructed and destroyed through our personal history. Other modern philosophers have stressed the importance of relations and interactions in the constitution of our identity.

In our post-modern culture technology is playing an ever more important role in shaping our identities. Prosthetics like eyeglasses and hearings aids have become customary. Mobile phones and hand held computers have become an intrinsic part of how we communicate and how we retrieve information. In virtual words like 'Second Life' we seem to be able to experiment with various identities (young, old, male, female, animal, object, etc.). Transhumanists predict that ultimately we will embody so much technology (artificial limbs, neural implants, genetic manipulation) that we will overcome our physical limitations and become perfect cyborgs.

These developments raise important questions regarding our individual and social identity. In this course we will investigate these questions from a philosophical point of view: 1) we will discuss the most important philosophical views of identity (Aristotle, Locke, Nietzsche, Peirce, Parfit, Shoemaker); 2) we will discuss contributions of philosophers of technology who have focussed on the influence of technology on our identities (Gehlen, Anders, Ihde, Clark, Haraway, Bostrom, Turkle); 3) we will solicit students to develop their own view of how technology has shaped and is shaping our identities. We will also analyse different anthropological, ethical, and religious assumptions and presuppositions in this debate.","insight in the current debate regarding the influence of technology on the constitution of identity; philosophical analysis of the anthropological, ethical, and religious assumptions and presuppositions in this debate","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35217&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

One would like to believe that such decisions - taken in and between organizations - are highly structured, well-planned and based on all the necessary information. In reality, information is often incomplete or contested by the multiple actors involved in decision making processes. Whether it is governments pushing through policies or companies trying to increase profits, rarely can a decision be made in isolation from competing interests, both within the organization and outside it. As a result, decisions often appear to be taken in a chaotic and ill-structured manner.

One of the primary purposes of this course is to make students realize that it is often impossible to reach decisions through rational problem solving and information processing. In many instances, carefully pre-conceived plans and hierarchically enforced decisions backfire. Even ministers or CEOs often cannot decide unilaterally but have to negotiate and make compromises. Decision making is characterized by permanent struggle and the exercise of both formal and informal power. In such situations, with many different actors that have a variety of interests yet are dependent on each other, rational problem solving is not only unattainable but also undesirable.

This course first of all introduces students to theoretical perspectives and models that help to describe how decisions are made in practice, i.e. what decision-makers really do, and explain why decisions are made in such a way, i.e. why decision makers actually do what they do. Beyond description and explanation, this course then acquaints students with how networks are structured and what strategies may be used in managing a variety of actors and interests. During the lectures students apply the theoretical perspectives and models to real-life examples of decision making. At the end of the course students is able to analyze decision making processes in networks, and to recognize (strategies for) decision making processes in a multi-actor context.","At the end of this course students will be able to:
- Understand and apply rational and political perspectives on decision making.
- Contrast the characteristics of networks with the characteristics of hierarchies, and recognize these in real life cases.
- Evaluate decision-making processes about complex problems in multi-actor settings, i.e. in networks and organizations.
- Recognize strategies for decision-making processes in networks and organizations.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35213&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"OE4651-15","Bottom Founded Offshore Structures","This course covers the entire life cycle of bottom founded offshore structures; from the concept design for topsides, substructures and foundations through fabrication, installation, maintenance and decommissioning. The primary focus however is the structural design and analysis fixed bottom founded offshore platforms.

To perform the design and analysis of bottom founded offshore structures, first the general design aspects are discussed and a classification of the yet existing structures is given. Next, the loads are considered that these structures are subjected to, with a focus on environmental loading and the consequent quasi-static behaviour of bottom founded offshore structures is discussed. Subsequently, the practical and theoretical aspects of the corresponding foundation design are considered.

Furthermore, the detailed design of steel structures is covered, with a focus on the detailed design analysis of structural connections, or joints, and the dimensioning of individual members for strength and stability. This includes a discussion of the design codes for bottom founded offshore structures. An important issue with steel offshore structures is fatigue; to increase the understanding of what potentially causes fatigue problems, the dynamics of bottom founded structures are discussed in some detail.

Additionally, participants will become familiar with construction, transport and installation aspects that dictate the design of these structures, as well as the inspection, maintenance and repair of existing structures. Therefore, the course program also includes a visit to a fabrication yard. Furthermore, key aspects of platform decommissioning and removal will be addressed. Finally, some particular topics are the specific design characteristics of jack-ups and compliant towers. Here, the structural design aspects of decks to provide space for drilling, production, power generation and life-support systems are important.

Understanding the mechanical behaviour of bottom founded offshore structures is of vital importance for its structural design and therefore, as part of this course, an assignment is given in order to reinforce the understanding and skills with regards to the structural design of bottom founded offshore structures.","After completing this course participants are able to participate in both the conceptual and the detailed design of bottom founded offshore structures. Thereby, participants will learn to understand the loads that bottom founded offshore structures are subjected to and understand how these loads affect the design of its substructures and foundations.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=38006&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"OE4629","Load identification and monitoring of structures","The course focusses on identification problems in structural dynamics, i.e. on the reconstruction of uncertain or unknown structural properties from measured vibration response data. These properties can be the natural frequencies or mode shapes of a structure, the stiffnesses of its' supports, the loading applied to the structure, etc. Such identification problems are encountered in all engineering applications where measured data (be it accelerations, strains, or displacements, etc.) are used to reduce uncertainty on the dynamic behaviour of in situ structures under real operating conditions.

To ensure generality, the presented identification and monitoring techniques are applied to structures modelled using a mass and stiffness matrix (extractable from any finite element software). Lectures are alternated by practical sessions in which the presented techniques are applied to a simple beam structure in Matlab.

The course can be divided into the following parts:
1. System identification, structural health monitoring, and model updating (2 lectures, 1 practical session)
Different techniques for extracting modal parameters from vibration response data are presented, and it is shown how the extracted parameters can be used
a) in vibration-based structural health monitoring applications, and
b) for updating (improving) our numerical models.
2. Load identification (2 lectures, 1 practical session)
First, a number of numerical aspects essential to the understanding and effective solution of linear inverse problems is addressed, with the focus on the load identification problem as encountered in structural dynamics. A simple frequency-domain technique for estimating the dynamic loads on a structure based on its measured vibration response is subsequently presented.
3. State estimation  the Kalman filter (1 lecture, 1 practical session)
Deterministic-stochastic models of structures are introduced, and it is shown how classical optimal state estimation techniques (e.g. the Kalman filter) can be used for continuous monitoring of structural deformations based on limited response data.

The remaining lecture hours and practical sessions are spent on introducing the students to Matlab, recapitulating deterministic models of structural systems as these were presented in the course CIE4140 Structural Dynamics (but with the focus on discretized as opposed to analytical representations), and reduced-order modelling. The latter topic is included because of its importance when dealing with in situ measured data from large-scale complex structures.","Participants completing the course will be able to:
a) identify the dynamic properties of a structure from measured vibration response data
b) calibrate finite element models based on identified dynamic properties
c) identify the forces acting on a structure from its vibrational response
d) estimate the states of a structure from vibration response data using the Kalman filter.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35925&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

The participating student population is divided into teams of 4 a 5 people max, consisting of a mix of various disciplines, backgrounds and cultures. Each team will be assigned with a senior university staff member or PhD student, who will act as their coach for the duration of the Project. Each team works with the same general information and each serves as a design consultant to the same external company on the same project. A bit of good-natured competition between the teams makes their activities even more interesting!

The Project is designed into 3 phases during which the teams have to transfer a hydrocarbon discovery somewhere in the world into a field development plan defined by a number of technical and economical parameters.
The teams will work with the same general information during this process which is provided in a number of lectures delivered by the Curriculum Leader on the topics of Project Management and Field Development, spiced up by talks on effective meetings, communication and working as a team in addition to dedicated lectures including a training session on oil & gas economics.
The immediate overall objective of these sessions is to increase the effectiveness of each participants project work activity and to paint the big picture thereby assisting the student in putting more specific material from the informational classes in a proper perspective for adaption into their project.
Specific field data is provided by an external company from the oil & gas industry.

Each Project team (as a group) is required to hold scheduled meetings with the coach, usually no more than once per week starting. These sessions serve as 'fixed point' in the Project team's activities. It is here that subgroups within a team can exchange information and the coach can discuss activities and progress with the team. An occasional session can be devoted to a methodology topic; additionally, students are free to use any source for data, expertise and / or experience gathering.","Participants successfully completing this course can expect to:

Dredging Engineering

In Dredging Engineering both the design and the operations of the equipment is strongly dependent on the physical processes involved. These processes are, the excavation of soil, mixture forming of soil and water, (hydraulic) transport, sedimentation, erosion and finally deposition.
In all the processes the behavior is determined by a combination of the physics of the soil (the solid phase) and the water (the liquid phase) and sometimes also the gas phase.
Dredging processes distinguish from many other multiphase processes by their very high concentrations. In the past a lot of research has been carried out leading to many empirical equations describing a quasi static behavior.
From the more recent research it is known that the processes involved often have a more dynamic behavior which can only be modelled by more fundamental relations.
To participate in this, students can carry out this research assignment in three possible ways.

A laboratory assignment.
The student will participate in ongoing laboratory research, usually as part of a PhD project.
This may involve the design and planning of the test stand, including data acquisition, carrying out the actual tests and interpretation and reporting.

A literature study.
Carrying out a literature survey on specific aspects of one of the above mentioned dredging processes.
In general with the purpose to get a state of the art overview.

A software feasibility or useability study.
The student will carry out an assesment to determine whether (new) software is feasible and useable for modelling specific (dredging) processes.","The study goals of this assignment are:
Prepare students in general and students with interest for fundamental research in particular in the art of experimental research.
Since PhD's need 4 years to prove they can carry out research independently, this 8 ECTS (about 240 hours) assignment can only cover some limited aspects of experimental research.
These aspects are:
A literature survey
A software feasability or useability study
Design of an experimental test stand
Planning of experimental research
The use of different measurement techniques and transducers
The use of data acquisition systems

The clue is to start the presentation with a question like 'how to do my MSc thesis research?', and to conclude with the answer to that question (e.g: 'with simulations, because that is the most effective').

The audience consists of your peers, i.e. students with the same level and background, but with a different MSc topic. Make sure that the presentation is adjusted to their knowledge and level. You may gain very useful advice from your audience, so that you can optimize your research plan before executing it.

Students will preferably contribute to the on-going research of PME.
In some cases an assignment with a industrial partner can be accepted. Always check your coach or coordinator first.

Main requirements:
the assignment should offer possibilities to gain and sharpen MSc/ 'ingenieurs' (EN: Engineer) skills. This basically leads to the following requirements on an assignment and the environment in which it takes place:

- The assignment must offer the possibility for a structured problem solving approach on academic level. This implies that the student has to address a 'grand problem' and not a series of small engineering problems, each of one standing mainly on its own. The problem must allow for a problem solving cycle which includes analysis, synthesis and where possible realisation and evaluation. On specific aspects, detailed analyses have to be made, for instance by means of (numerical) modelling and analysis, experimentation etc. The emphasis is of course different in each assignment.

- The assignment includes a problem analysis phase. The typical starting point of an assignment is a first problem definition; the problem analysis phase should give clarity on what and where the real problems are and which problems are going to be addressed in subsequent phases

- In the solution generation phase there should be some freedom as well. Assignments which have from the early start on a defined detailed solution direction from which the student may not deviate are usually not suitable for MSc projects.

- The topics must be within the area of the research topics of PME and preferably follow the focus area chosen. For proper coaching and for being able to establish good links with the company involved, we are looking for subjects that match with the interest and coaching capabilities of our staff members.","The overall objective of this assignment is to demonstrate a sufficient academic level in the field of Mechanical Engineering, focussing on research topics of PME.

More specifically, the student is able to meet, to a sufficient level, the following qualifications:

1. Broad and profound knowledge of engineering sciences (applied physics and mathematics) and the capability to apply this knowledge at an advanced level in the variant-related discipline.

2. Broad and profound scientific and technical knowledge of the track related discipline and the skills to use this knowledge effectively. The discipline is mastered at different levels of abstraction, including a reflective understanding of its structure and relations to other fields, and reaching in part the forefront of scientific or industrial research and development. The knowledge is the basis for innovative contributions to the discipline in the form of new designs or development of new knowledge.

3. Thorough knowledge of paradigms, methods and tools as well as the skills to actively apply this knowledge for analysing, modelling, simulating, designing and performing research with respect to innovative variant-related systems, with an appreciation of different application areas.

4. Capability to independently solve technological problems in a systematic way involving problem analysis, formulating sub-problems and providing innovative technical solutions, also in new and unfamiliar situations. This includes a professional attitude towards identifying and acquiring lacking expertise, monitoring and critically evaluating existing knowledge, planning and executing research, adapting to changing circumstances, and integrating new knowledge with an appreciation of its ambiguity, incompleteness and limitations.

5. Capability to work both independently and in multidisciplinary teams, interacting effectively with specialists and taking initiatives where necessary.

6. Capability to effectively communicate (including presenting and reporting) about one's work such as solutions to problems, conclusions, knowledge and considerations, to both professionals and non-specialised public in the English language.

7. Capability to evaluate and assess the technological, ethical and societal impact of one's work, and to take responsibility with regard to sustainability, economy and social welfare.

"ME1130","Robotics Practicals","This course is meant for students that are doing their MSc project in the field of robotics, e.g. at 3ME/BMechE or 3ME/DCSC. It enables you to quickly get into your MSc subject without losing time to teach yourself the necessary skills within the course of your MSc project or /and to bug the AIO's or Postdocs with your trivial questions; by then you have already built up that basic knowledge in ME1130.

In order for you to apply you have to send a motivation email to Prof. Pieter Jonker; p.p.jonker@tudelft.nl in which you described in which field of robotics you are going to do your MSc research work. It is mandatory that you already have found a mentor with which you have agreed upon a title an insight in the research you are going to do in your MSc project.

This course is a self-study course, meaning that you can start and end whenever you want. Study at home with tutorials and a computer, make exercises and explain in the end what you have done and why to the instructor. If he/she is satisfied you are done. If not, you have to study more. If you have questions you can always ask the instructor; email, text, app or walk by. Due to the nature of the course, there is no set deadline for completion. However, we advise you to finish it within the quarter.

The basis of the course is 1) the Linux Operating System and 2) Object Oriented programming in C++ with in addition either:
(a) The Robot Operating System (ROS)
(b) OpenCV; i.e. 2D image processing
(c) Point Cloud Library (PCL); i.e. 3D image processing

Linux:
Although Windows is the most prevalent operating system on desktop PCs, Linux became very popular for embedded systems such as robots. Developing for embedded Linux systems is most easily done in Linux itself, and this course aims to familiarize students with the use of Linux on the desktop. It encompasses the following topics: Architecture, Installation, Window system, File system, Shell, Scripting, Compilation and Latex.


C++:
C++is one of the most widely used programming languages. Being an object oriented language brings great advantages comparing to its predecessor C. This practicum is designed to give the student a practical knowledge on C++ programming. The course encompasses the following topics: Introduction to C++, general features, basic programming in C++, functions, pointers, classes and objects, graphical user interface and some advanced topics such as data structures, casting and exception handling. C++ is a must if you want to make software for intelligent - real-time - control of machines or/and image processing.


ROS:
The Robot Operating System is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms. Creating truly robust, general-purpose robot software is hard. From the robot's perspective, problems that seem trivial to humans often vary wildly between instances of tasks and environments. Dealing with these variations is so hard that no single individual, laboratory, or institution can hope to do it on their own.


OpenCV:
OpenCV is a computer vision library designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take advantage of multi-core processing. Enabled with OpenCL, it can take advantage of the hardware acceleration of each underlying heterogeneous compute platform. OpenCV is released under a BSD license and hence it is free for both academic and commercial use. It has C++, C, Python and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android.


PCL:
The Point Cloud Library is a stand-alone, large scale, open project for 2D/3D image processing and point cloud processing. Also PCL is released under the terms of the BSD license, and thus free for commercial and research use.","To obtain hands on experience - beginners level - with Linux: You are able to manipulate various Linux commands and write shell scripts.

"MS4071","Materials in Art and Design","In recent years materials science is increasingly applied to the study of art and archaeological objects. This field is known as archaeometry and it includes three research directions. First of all, authenticity studies on art objects rely on material analysis of the object. Second, artworks suffer from degradation studies that need to be understood at a materials science level. Third, stylistic developments in art history can often be related to the development of new materials or production techniques.

The main challenge in this field is to bridge the interface between the humanities and the sciences. Interpreting the findings of materials science in a non-scientific, historical context is the crucial skill in this course.

** structures at notch locations (stress concentrations at macro-scale) as part of structural members or at the member connections; particular attention will be paid to arc-welded joints in that respect, since ship- and offshore structures are predominantly stiffened (curved) panel assemblies consisting of plates, shells and tubular members.

 Macroscopic (notch) stress concentrations, -distributions and -intensities:

** as part of structural members.

** at structural member connections (weld notch stress distributions in particular: the cyclic remote mechanical- and (quasi-constant, thermal) residual part.

 Fatigue resistance:

** welded joint testing at {small, large, full} scale.

** damage parameter  life time relations in different ranges (low-, medium- and high-cycle fatigue); formulations and parameter estimates using regression analysis (least squares- and likelihood approaches).

 Stress and strain based fatigue assessment methods (seam- and tubular welded joints):

** global and local approaches using intact geometry parameters (nominal stress-, structural hot spot stress- and effective notch {stress, strain} concept).

** local approach using a crack damaged geometry parameter (crack tip stress intensity- and equivalent stress concept).

 Crack growth at notches:

** testing (measurement techniques).

** micro- and macro (short and long) crack growth relations.

 Fatigue influence factors: surface roughness/hardness, environment, load ratio/mean stress, constant and variable amplitude loading (time domain analysis, cycle counting, spectral approaches, scatter diagrams, cumulative damage hypotheses), proportionality (in-phase, out-of-phase), multi-axiality and welding improvement techniques.

"MTM1416","Fundamentals of Marine Engineering","Marine engineering is the field of engineering and science that deals with the design and operation of main and auxiliary systems on board ships and other marine and/or offshore structures. These systems include mechanical, electrical and other types of (energy) distribution systems. In the course 'Fundamentals of Marine Engineering' the following systems and their main components will be studied:
- Propulsion systems
- Electric power generation and distribution systems
- Propulsion support systems
o Cooling water systems
o Fuel distribution systems
o Others
- Safety Systems
o Fire-Fighting systems
o Bilge  Ballast water systems
- Hotel Systems
o Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems
o Refrigeration systems
o Others
- Waste heat Systems

The first two systems are traditionally considered the main systems on board ships and nowadays these systems become more and more integrated. Many different components and combinations of components (i.e. ship power plant concepts) are available for these main systems. Some of the power plant concepts are considered 'proven technology' because of their impressive track record and widespread application, others are considered more innovative; e.g. application of energy storage devices leads to hybrid propulsion system concepts. The course will discuss important design considerations for these systems. Working principles and characteristics of the components in these main systems will play a central role in the course in order to analyse performance at system level.

The main systems can however not operate properly without auxiliary systems like cooling water and lubricating oil systems. Such propulsion support systems and other auxiliary systems, like safety and hotel systems, that provide the crew with suitable living conditions at sea will also be studied in detail in the course. In some modern ship designs, the energy requirement and complexity of the system architecture of auxiliary systems like HVAC systems, is even more extensive than that of the propulsion system. Many auxiliary systems are pipe flow systems (tasked with the distribution of fluids); its main components are pumps and heat exchangers. The working principles of pumps and heat exchangers will therefore also be a topic to study.

To design and operate the main and auxiliary systems on board ships, knowledge of marine systems, and the machinery and equipment within those systems is required. For instance, to design a HVAC system the influence of ambient conditions and heat load on the internal conditions of the ship needs to be understood. But also fan characteristics such as flow capacity versus pressure head and the design of a ducting system, including the relation between flow and resistance, needs to be known.

Marine engineering is the art of integrating the components into systems in order to be able to perform a specific set of functions. A thorough understanding of the working principles of these systems and their main components is indispensable for a marine engineer tasked with designing these systems. He/she needs to make sure that all systems will operate properly in all environmental conditions that can be encountered by the ship while navigating the seas (e.g. extreme temperatures, rough seas, etc.). On top of this he/she will be faced with additional design requirements for all systems which concern their vulnerability, maintainability, energy efficiency and/or emission of pollutant substances.

Designing these systems is a challenging job indeed and the fundamentals of marine engineering course aims to provide students with the required knowledge and tools.","Give an overview of main and auxiliary systems found on board ships and other marine structures.

Explain different ship propulsion system and/or power plant concepts and their design considerations.

Explain different auxiliary system concepts and their design considerations.

o Diesel engines
o Gas turbines
o Propellers
o Electric machines
o Pumps
o Heat exchangers
o Air conditioning units
o Refrigeration plants
o Waste heat utilization boilers and heaters

"BMA0302","BME Introduction colloquium","The introductory colloquium (=presentation) is the second of three official academic presentations that you will give. You should perform this presentation one or two months after your Literature Colloquium, i.e. early in your MSc thesis research period.
You will give a 20-25 minute presentation about the plan for your MSc research. This turns out to be more difficult than it seems, because there is no finished story to tell. The clue is to start the presentation with questions such as 'how to do my MSc thesis research? Or What will be the approach for my MSc thesis
research?', and to conclude with the answer to that question (e.g: 'with simulations, because that is the most effective'). The focus is on the 'How' part of your project, which is typically the methods section in your MSc thesis.
The audience consists of your peers, i.e. students with the same level and background, but with a different MSc topic. Make sure that the presentation is adjusted to their knowledge level. You may gain useful advice from your
audience, so that you can optimize your research plan before executing it. Thus, make sure that they thoroughly understand your problem and approach.","Even if you are an excellent designer or researcher, you should be able to communicate your ideas and convince others that your approach or ideas are good.

At the tissue level, the connections and networks of neurons are studied from two perspectives:
1) Hodological: what are the important tracts and what are their functions? The main topics are: sensibility, motor systems, cerebellum and striatum. Cortex and hippocampus are topics in the module Hormones and the Nervous System.
2) Neurobiological: Parkinsons disease.

The module is partially based on problem-based learning, thereby using several computer programmes. The brain is studied macroscopically using gross anatomy and the computer program 'Caput', while microscopy of the connections is studied with the aid of 'Marani's mind-maker' and a microscopy computer program.

"BM1086L","Surgery for Engineers","In abdominal surgery, the past decade a huge shift from open surgery, with exposure to the abdomen with a midline incision towards small incisions and scopes (Minimally Invasive Surgery= MIS) for several surgical indications is observed. This new MIS approach, inherently induced the need for the development of new instruments. Although these new instruments have their original function comparable to the conventional instruments, due to the access difficulties to the target organs, high tech adaptations are made to have these instruments function optimally. Due to this adaptation specific safety issues, ergonomics and sterility issues etc are encountered. Also at the Operating Room (OR) specific procedures had to be introduced to rinse and sterilize these instruments and specific errors occurred which seemed to be different from the conventional instruments and apparatus. However, new developments in this specific field, either by engineers and industry optimized the outcome of MIS procedures.
Engineers play a specific role in these developments, and their view on this matter is shown to be of utmost importance to doctors and additionally towards surgical outcome results.

Due to the complex route these MIS instruments have (from OR to the Central Sterilisation Department (CSD) and the checks made for safety and re-use etc.), several protocols are made to optimize this process.

To get insight in the specific use of these instruments and the processes available for these MIS instruments, its hick-ups, both encountered during surgery by the surgeon and by OR staff/technicians, the student gets the opportunity to observe some MIS procedures and follow the instrument from the OR to CSD. Also background information has to be obtained from technicians at the OR, Medical Physicians and the surgeons. A short report has to be written, containing their observations of this surgical instrumental routing and suggestion for improvements will be given.

"BM1200","Computational Mechanics of Tissues and Cells","The course consists of two parts: lectures and hands-on workshops. There are two sessions per education week. Out of those two sessions, one is devoted to lectures and the other to workshops. The lectures are designed to give students in-depth knowledge of the mechanical behavior of cells and tissues and how their behavior can be explained in terms of mechanical theories.

The hands-on workshops give students the opportunity to apply what they have learned in the lectures. A commercial Finite Element (FEM) modeling package is used to make FEM modeling as practical as possible. The emphasis is therefore shifted from the technical details of the FEM modeling towards understanding the modeling procedures and applying them for analysis of certain problems. The problems are chosen to be as close to the real-world problems as possible. In addition to finite element modeling, the principles of medical image processing for finite element modeling are discussed. A few sessions of the workshop will be devoted to a commercially-available medical image processing package (provided that teaching licenses are secured).

The course is divided into two almost equal parts. The first part covers patient-specific finite element modeling of tissues and implants. The second part is focused on the mechanical behavior of cells and proteins (such as collagen).

The following topics will be covered in the lecturing (tentative):

Lecture 1: Introduction to the course

Lecture 2: Geometry of tissues and implants for finite element modeling (including statistical shape and statistical shape and intensity models)

Lecture 3-5: Material modeling and material properties (including isotropic and anisotropic linear elasticity, hyperelasticity, viscoelasticity, and poroelasticity)

Lecture 6: Loads and boundary conditions (including musculoskeletal models)

Lecture 7: Modeling of tissue growth and adaptation

Lecture 8: Introduction to cell mechanics, continuum models of the cell

Lecture 9: Tensegrity models of the cell

Lecture 10: Polymer-based models of the cell

Lecture 11-12: Protein mechanics

The workshops start from very simple modeling exercises that introduce the FEM package and show how it can be used for simple modeling tasks. The level of difficulty will gradually increase up to the point that students can do FEM modeling of tissues, cells, proteins, and tissue-implant systems.

"BM1113","Practical Course on the Characterization & Processing of Biomaterials","The course is composed of six interconnected modules, each of which has a central theme within the scope of biomaterials science and engineering.

- Module I: Preparation of tissue-engineering scaffolds from powder (sieving, cold and hot pressing and sintering or injection moulding, debinding and sintering). Materials may be chosen from iron, magnesium, stainless steel and titanium for biodegradable or permanent scaffolds. Investigations include particle morphology, angle of repose, size and size distribution, green and sintered porosity. The design of porosity and control of porosity throughout the whole chain of processing will be highlighted, as porosity is closely related to biofunctionality and in the case of scaffolds it offers the unique possibilities of osseointegration and drug delivery.

- Module II: Biomaterial characterization (optical microstructure, density, tribological behaviour, magnetic characteristics and phase transition temperatures). Biomaterials include magnesium, iron, stainless steel, shape memory alloys, biopolymers, bioceramics and animal bone. Focus will be placed on the close correlation between these characteristics and the major clinical imperatives for biomaterials in e.g. orthopaedics, dentistry and cardiology.

- Module III: Biomechanical properties (E-modulus, yield strength in tension and compression, fatigue resistance and fracture toughness). Biomaterials to be tested include magnesium, titanium, stainless steel, biopolymers, bioceramics and animal bone. Of particular interest is a fundamental knowledge base for the choice of materials to fulfill the clinical requirements for applications, e.g. cemented or non-cemented hip or knee arthroplasty, in order to avoid postoperative complications such as stress shielding and (stress corrosion) cracking.

- Module IV: Surface characterization & biofunctionalization Biomaterials surface properties play a key role in the interactions with the host tissue. In this module, methods for surface characterization (roughness, porosity, texture, surface energy, surface charge, bioactivity) will be introduced and used to evaluate various biomaterials. In addition, special attention will be paid to generate engineered and biomimetic surface layers to promote specific cell interactions or provide additional biofunctionality (e.g. osteoconductivity or antibacterial activity or drug release) as clinically required for active biomaterials.

- Module V: In vitro biodegration rate (static and non-static immersion testing in different media with different initial pH values) and degradation electrochemistry (open-circuit potential and potentiodynamic polarization). Biodegradable materials include magnesium, porous iron and biopolymers. In addition to the basic medical concerns such as non-toxicity of degradation products and degradation profile, the biofunctionality of these biogradable materials with respect to cell adhesion and proliferation is of special interest in applications such as orthopedic fixation devices that clinically require bioactivity to regenerate new tissue in a relatively short time.

- Module VI: Holding power of orthopedic devices in synthetic bone. Bone screws are basic orthopedic devices for bone fixation, whose design and materials properties are of importance for their performance.

"BM1101","Biomaterials","In improving patient care, especially in relation with tissue loss or dysfunction, the use of proper biomaterials plays a key role. The shift from tissue removal to tissue replacement and at present, tissue regeneration is driven by the (i)evolution of biomaterials from bioinert to bioactive and bioresorbable and (ii) the increasingly complex biomedical problems of an aging and more active population. As an example, the existing total joint replacements have a 75 - 85 % survivability at 15 years. However, since they were first introduced in the 1960s, average life expectancy increased by at least ten years impacting on the quality of the bone and implants survivability that deteriorate with age. As a consequence, improved implant survivability by 10 - 20 years and alternative treatment methods that delay or eliminate the use of prostheses are badly needed.

The Biomaterials course covers in an interdisciplinary approach (biomaterial engineering and biology) the background information on type, composition, processing and properties of biomaterials along with their evolution. Metallic, polymeric and ceramic materials are included and their properties are described and compared with those of biological materials. The main methodologies for biomaterials characterization are covered as well as the procedures for biomaterials standardization and regulation. Further, the interactions between biomaterials and specific biological environments are explained and used for defining the specific requirements and selection principles for biomaterials. Here, biomaterials and medical devices for orthopedics, cardiovascular system, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine are covered. Finally, the research directions and approaches for development of novel biomaterials are outlined.","At the end of the course the students will be able to:

"ME1610-11","Tissue Biomechanics of Bone, Cartilage and Tendon","The healing process of bone is a beautiful example of adaptive repair in a living tissue.
The tissues of the musculoskeletal system such as bone, cartilage and tendon/ligament are able to adapt their architecture to changes in external loads and to repair damage. Astronauts lose bone mass during spaceflight, as their skeleton adapts to the low gravity environment. Tennis players have stronger bones in their dominant arm and high resistance training, like weight-lifting, increases bone mass.

During this lecture series, a number of topics related to musculoskeletal tissues will be discussed. An introduction to the development of the skeletal system will be given, as well as bone and cartilage biology and the remodeling and repair processes that are important during life. In addition the most important skeletal diseases will be discussed, such as osteoporosis (reduced bone mass that increases fracture risk) and osteoarthritis (degeneration of the joints). The course will also cover diagnostic methods, imaging and computer analyses that can be used to obtain information on the skeleton from novel imaging modalities.","1. know the function and role of the main constituents of bone, cartilage and tendon tissue and the organization of these tissues at the different hierarchies

"BM1250","Human Movement Control B Neuromuscular Control","The flexibility of humans in generating movement is enormous. With little attention most people can perform complex tasks such as walking or riding a bicycle. However, a coordinated interaction between separate limbs is required while feedback from the different senses is continuously integrated to cope with unexpected disturbances, such as minor imperfections in the road. Neuromuscular control investigates how the central nervous system (CNS) is able to generate movements, stabilize posture, and integrate sensory feedback in the control actions. During this course the role of subsystems (e.g. muscles, sensory systems, CNS) and their interactions as well as uncertainty in sensory signals are discussed with a focus on reaching movements and posture maintenance. During the course it will be shown how this knowledge can help in understanding impaired motor function after neurological disorders, like Stroke and Parkinson's disease.","After this course the student must be able to:

"BM1100","Orthopaedic Implants and Technology","Most people have first hand experience with the limitations and impact of trauma of the musculo-skeletal system: a sprained ankle severely limits your mobility and causes severe pain, but will heal without too many residual complaints.

However, diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis - irreversibly destroy joints, and cause severe limitation of the patient's mobility and produce pain. Today, 600 million people worldwide are suffering from the limitations and pain that are caused by arthritis.

In the end, these affected joints will often be replaced surgically with an artificial joint. Worldwide 1.5 million hips and 750,000 knees are replaced with a joint prosthesis annually. After a joint replacement, patients are normally pain free again and gain in mobility. A joint replacement is one of the most rewarding surgical procedures.

Ten years post-operatively, 5 to 10% of these prostheses  annually 150.000 cases - have failed and need to be replaced in a demanding revision operation. For total shoulder replacement these numbers are much higher: up to 44% of the implants have failed at ten years follow-up.

"IO3873","Design and Prototyping Studio","This course forms the main design track in the minor, it runs during the full semester. Students work in groups on the main design assignment.

In the Design and Prototyping Studio course students explore the possibilities for dynamic, interactive spaces in which people and environments engage in a mutual relationship with each other. The course structure is built around a group project assignment of an interactive social space, consisting of autonomously operating intelligent building components and smart products forming an architectural ecosystem.

In order to design and engineer successful interactive environments it is necessary to integrate knowledge of different disciplines in order to address not only technological, but also cultural, social, structural and aesthetical aspects of such systems that are all inherently interdependent on each other. Considering buildings to be dynamically performing entities, engaging multiple users and external factors in interactive exchange of information means that architecture has to be treated as a complex system.

Therefore students from different disciplines work together in multidisciplinary groups that design, produce, and deploy unprecedented interactive spatial installations. In this course students are encouraged to formulate challenging design visions. Those visions are subsequently realized and tested in form of robust, fully operational and full-scale prototypes. In process of building the prototypes the student will acquire practical knowledge needed to undertake this challenge. Specialists from all involved fields provide professional guidance. In addition the student gets direct, hands-on access to cutting-edge technologies provided by affiliated educational and commercial partners.

"IO3045","Video for Designers","In recent years video has truly become a medium for the masses. Nowadays, ordinary computers have become powerful enough to process video at reasonable speeds, editing software has become mainstream, compression techniques have dramatically improved and hard disks hugely expanded, while at the same time, with the exponential rise of smartphones and other digital equipment, video camera's have become almost ubiquitous. All these developments have brought video within the domain of designer students as well. So far, however, its use is mainly limited for presentation purposes. Rather than the single output of a dedicated assignment, the video itself is mainly a by-product, constructed as a vehicle for showing the properties of the main product to be designed.

In this course, however, video will be the main deliverable. The main goal of the course is to explore the use of video as a possible (generative) design tool. Besides being used for presentations, video will also be used as a means to communicate findings of etnographic research, to express certain atmospheres and to visualize future interactions or services.

Students first will be taught basic techniques for shooting, editing and publishing videos and then will apply these into specific design assignments. In each of the assignments they will roughly go through the stages of pre-production, production, and post-production. The result of each assignment is a short video, which will be discussed, analyzed and assessed. Throughout the course a practical will be run on the use of video editing software (Adobe Premiere and After Effects)."," To understand and apply basic concepts and principles involved in the creation (pre-production, production and post-production) of digital videos

"IO3040","Software","Software is the brain of product-service systems being responsible among others for intelligent functions, smart product/service behaviour and management of user-product- service interaction. When designing product-service systems, industrial design engineers are responsible for conceptualizing feasible software solutions that not only fulfil the stakeholders' requirements, but also provide interoperability with other components. To be able to perform these tasks designers need to obtain a good understanding of available ICT technologies, and be aware of their capabilities and limitations. In this course you will acquire insight into the basics of ICT solutions used in product service systems and get hands on experience with software technologies. By the end of the course, you will be capable to act as the mediator between ICT specialists and other stakeholders involved in the product-service system development and capable to write simple software applications.
Software (IO3040) is an elective course. The course is systematically composed from some theoretical constituents, which is then subsequently applied in practical and experimental tasks.

The project is more or less divided into the three main phases of the product development process known from the previous PO-courses: Strategy and analysis, Concept design, and Embodiment design and implementation. Specific for this course is a pre-phase of orientation, selection of case and identification of areas for professional development. Each student develops his/her own design goal, project goal and professional development goal, and sets up a project structure and planning accordingly. This set up and its deliverables are agreed upon by the design coach and the client. Four times during the project the achieved results and plans are presented to and discussed with the client. Depending on the given case and the goals of each individual student, focus and emphasis can lay on different phases of the product development process.

The bachelor final project is probably the first project in which students work with a real client. For the first time, they will go through a more or less complete development process on their own. Together with the client, students will determine where to put the focus and what the end result of the project will be. Students are responsible for what aspects are integrated in the design and they will support their work with new knowledge wherever this is required. Students will develop and grow professionally based on the activities they plan for themselves in the project.","At a university a student learns certain ways of working and in the Bachelor Final Project these are referred to as academic behaviours. As the Bachelor Final Project is the last project executed in the Bachelor programme, students are expected to have reached a certain quality in these behaviours and it is expected that students continue developing them during this project. An academic way of working integrates these general academic behaviours. An academic way of working, is typically defined by the following behaviours:
 Identify the topic and plan action (and reflect on this),
 Explore the topic (and reflect on this),
 Analyse the topic (and reflect on this),
 Drawn conclusions on the topic and adjust actions accordingly (and reflect on this),
 Discussed the applicability and validity of the results and its implications (and reflect on this),
 Apply the valuable results into the work (and reflect on this).
During the project we expect and encourage students to show and work on these general academic behaviours in all their work, repeatedly, within each of the learning objectives.

In the Bachelor Final Project students apply the knowledge they have gathered and the skills and competences they have been working on so far in the bachelor, as students will go through an integrated product development process individually. In this way the project can be seen as a Proof of Competence for the whole Bachelor programme. At the same time the project is part of the learning trajectory to become a BSc Industrial Design Engineer. This is why the Bachelor Final Project gives students the opportunity to apply and work on their development on all 39 competences of the IDE bachelor program. However, the course has its own specific learning objectives, on which students are assessed:
1. Students are able to integrate design conditions and aspects, in order to achieve relevant design result.
2. Students are able to gain and apply new knowledge in order to achieve credible design result.
3. Students are able to plan, structure and methodically execute design work in order to achieve the anticipated result.
4. Students are able to communicate their work in order to enable fruitful cooperation.
5. Students are able to customize their design project in order to enable their professional development.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36807&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"IO3050","Mechatronics","One of the trends in product development is the replacement of conventional or complex mechanical mechanisms with mechatronic systems. Mechatronics is the integration of mechanics, electronics and control engineering; it offers unique opportunities for industrial design engineers in creating smart, cheap, reliable and versatile consumer products. Mechatronic designs achieve higher precision, faster response, smaller size, a wealth of consumer features and allow for products to adapt to their environment. The main advantage of applying mechatronic design in consumer products is enabling complex tasks without user interference. The most appealing application today is the robot.

Examples of mechatronic applications can be found in large numbers of products on the market today; home appliances (smart cooker, washing machines), home entertainment (TV, ambient light), automotive sub-systems (ABS, cruise control, motor management)and personal health and safety (blood pressure meter, minimal invasive surgery).


The key-issue in the course is to show how to achieve synergy between mechanical and electronic components while striving for added value (economical, user benefit) in consumer products. We do this by answering three key questions:
1. How can Mechatronic design principles be applied in design engineering and how do these principles affect the product?
2. What are the basic working principles of mechatronic components (sensors, actuators and converters) and how can (micro) electronics be applied?
3. How can optimized mechatronic system performance be achieved by combining physical models knowledge and application of intelligently balanced control strategies?

Besides the general introduction into mechatronic design, the course content can be divided over four specific areas of knowledge: mechanics, (micro) electronics, control engineering (including relevant mathematics) and embedded software (Arduino). The course program integrates theoretical background knowledge in a working prototype.","1. The student knows how to apply mechatronic design principles in design engineering and is aware of how this improves the product.
2. The student knows the basic working principles of mechatronic components (sensors, actuators and converters) and how to apply (micro) electronics.
3. The student is familiar with the classic principles of control engineering and how to apply them in engineering design
4. The student is able to program a simple embedded system.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36800&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"IO3060","Creating in Project Teams","Welcome to Creating in Project Teams. This is a student-centred course in which you identify your own learning needs in terms of the course topics: creativity, teamwork and project management. Once this takes place, you will form a team with other like-minded students and, under the guidance of a coach, gain knowledge about your area of interest and explore this topic for the duration of the course. Exploring the topic of your selection means searching for information about it, experiencing the issue at hand, and sharing your findings with the rest of the class.","This course aims to encourage you to reflect about your work and behaviour as a designer in the 'typical design context'. This could entail, but it is not limited to: how you think as a designer, how you work individually and in groups, the approaches/methods you use, how you make decisions, etc. Such reflection should enable you to work on an aspect you have identified in your behaviour and that you want to learn more about and (possibly) improve. For instance, you may realise there is a type of role, when working in teams, that you are not good at and that you want to change/improve.

Learning Objectives (LOs)
By the end of the course you should be able to:
LO1  Reflect on your past/present experiences as a designer and identify topics for clarification/improvement.
LO2  Search for and analyse relevant information on the topic you want to learn about/improve.
LO3  Make a plan and carry out a meaningful experience in a team where you explore vividly the topic of your study.
LO4  Reflect on your course of actions when searching and experiencing your selected topic and recommend improvements for (your) design practice.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36799&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"IO3075","Towards Circular Product Design","Design will play a key role in the transition to a circular economy. Too often we design products with little regard for what happens when we no longer want them. But waste is design gone wrong!
This course will strengthen your skills as a designer by tackling the transition from our linear 'take-make-waste' economy to a circular economy. In a circular economy products loop back into the production system through repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing and eventually, recycling. By doing this we extend their useful life and design out waste.","This 7,5 ECTS elective is designed to teach you to:
 Describe the basic principles and terms underlying the circular economy.
 Describe the business models that can deliver value in the circular economy.
 Apply circular economy principles to redesign a (linear) business case, with the help of the Business Model Canvas.
 Use circular economy principles to (re)design a product.
 Evaluate the circularity and sustainability of a product.
 Reflect on the barriers and opportunities of going circular.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36797&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"IO3030","Design Visualisation","The course of Design Visualization aims to provide the required set of tools, instructions and exercises to help you practice and experience a series of steps and techniques as part of a practice based design process.
The main goal of this elective is to learn to use a variety of visualization techniques in a more professional way.

In order to create a clear link to the daily product design practice (design departments or agencies, various audiences), the course integrates the various ways of visualizing and various techniques, in correspondence with the stage of progress: from professional ideation sketches to design proposals of product, parts, materials and product use. The course focuses on the student's ability to visually develop and tell about his or her design trajectory.

The course comprises both analogue and digital drawing techniques, besides the use of other means of design visualization (e.g. photography, poster composition), applied in integrated design trajectories. In most of the weeks, the first session will concern drawing on paper, and the second will deal with drawing/editing digitally. Additionally, with the help of a small series of lectures, students will be guided in the use of photography, play acting and poster composition.","-Students are able to generate and visualize their designs on paper according to the provided rules of perspective and suggesting volume.

This means that products are becoming smarter, and services are moving away from screens only. With cloud services and a new generation of objects and places variously connected to the Internet, cross media interaction design is changing too. Not only we have to move from the design of products to the design of experiences: we need to move from the design of single, isolated interactions to the design of broader ecosystems.

In this course, students will explore how to design a cross-media experience. This will be achieved through the conceptualization and detailing of an integrated ecosystem of social practices, data streams, and technology platforms.","At the end of this course you will be able to:

1. Identify, describe and analyse existing examples of cross media concepts;
2. Write a design brief that describes the aim of your cross media concept and the benefits for the stakeholders involved;

"IO2081","Modelling","Modelling is about understanding the nature: our world, ourselves and our work. Everything that we observe has a cause (typically several) and has the effect thereof. The heart of modelling lies in identifying, understanding and quantifying these cause-and-effect relationships.

A model can be treated as a (selective) representation of a system. We create the model by defining a mapping from the system space to the model space, thus we can map system state and behaviour to model state and behaviour. By defining the inverse mapping, we may map results from the study of the model back to the system. In this course, using an overarching modelling paradigm, students will become familiar with several instances of modelling, e.g., mechanics, thermal dynamics, fluid mechanics, etc.","This course will educate and train students with the skills necessary to:
1) Acquaint with the modelling procedure;
2) Identify and qualify components & their relations within systems;

"IO1042","Design and Experience","Introduction:
This course consists of several different projects, each dealing with underlying motives that constitute product design. Designing a product is more than just providing the right aesthetic qualities. Form and color provide us with qualities that directly relate to our emotions. We can read these qualities and experience a specific product character.
The shape of a product also relates to our culture. A product expresses our general cultural context, as well as the more specific culture of the user (think of 'lifestyle'). Products even express the culture of the designer, who's role it is to conquer the new cultural values of tomorrow.
The key questions for this course are:
1. What underlying dimensions regarding the human perception and experience are of influence to the shape of a product?
2. How do you get a grip on these dimensions?
3. What societal role does a product play for its user?
4. How is the perception, experience and appreciation for a products influenced by social / cultural / technological developments?
5. How can a products shape and color be developed, and what techniques can the designer use for that purpose?","Study goals / competencies

Aesthetics:
- The student is capable to see the formal characteristics of a given shape as a kind of language that can be (re)used and manipulated to serve different goals:

"ID6101HPM","Master Honours Project (MHP)","This Master's Honours Project (MHP) forms the spine of the HPM-student's programme. The MHP covers all necessary activities that are aimed at gathering, integrating and accumulating knowledge related to the topic chosen by the HPM-student. It covers and integrates the learning in the widest sense of the HPM-student.

Each student has a coach from the IDE-staff who supports the student (when necessary) in making decisions, showing new pathways and providing contacts regarding the student's project.
An integral part of the Honours Project is active participation within the IDE and TUD Honours community as well as discussion and interaction with peers from research or practice relevant to your HP topic.

The carrier for these activities is formed by the Master's Honours Seminar that runs each semester. Each honours student participates in various roles in the three semesters of his/her honours programme within this seminar.
This part of the MHP addresses professional skills, such as coaching & peer feedback, presentation skills, building a portfolio, and communicating and disseminating insights and results with/to peers in the field outside the TUD community.
The roles are:
 Support role (1st semester)
 Plan, develop and execute own track (2nd semester)
 Participate actively (3rd semester)
 Showcase honours project results after graduation (4th semester)

The Masters Honours Project needs to be planned, executed and managed by the honours student. By doing this independently the student shows that he/she is capable of initiating and running a project from vision to realisation. Activities in the MHP could be, but are not limited to doing interviews with experts in the field of HPM-topic, collect and read literature, do research, writing propositions, perform experiments, design and test prototypes.

The final results of the MHP are 1) the Knowledge Product, 2) the Showcase and 3) the Honours Thesis.
The Knowledge product aims to transfer the knowledge and insights gained to the student community and the staff of the IDE-faculty.
The Showcase covers the insights gained in an easy to grasp form, e.g. a poster, video clip or model.
The Honours Thesis is an academic report that, similar to a graduation report, shows in a logical order how the content/knowledge related to the student's topic came about. The Honours Thesis motivates the justification of the work done, the approach followed, and decisions taken leading to the Knowledge Product. In short, it reports on all relevant activities that have lead to mastering the Honours Project, properly referring to literature, courses followed, interviews, or websites. Special attention should be given to the work and results related to the Masters Honours Seminar.","The study goals of the MHP are related to and derived from the study goals of the TUD Honours Programme Masters. The work done and results delivered must illustrate/show that the student is capable of:
 Integrating all findings, insights and progress related to his/her HPM-topic into a coherent whole;
 Applying academic qualities like theorizing, model forming and reasoning in his/her honours programme;
 Switching from abstraction levels related to his/her HPM-topic in order to create an integrated knowledge base;
 Collaborating with disciplines outside his/her field of education;
 Planning, organizing and executing independently a challenging project with at the outset unclear goals and deliverables;
 Elaborating on the societal/scientific/educational consequences of the insights gained in his/her honours programme;
 Writing a brief and academic report about his/her work (Honours thesis);
 Creating a knowledge product that covers the findings of 16 ec work in transferrable form: on paper, digital, presentation or as part of a public gallery;
 Community building with other HP students, within and across cohort, within and across faculty, as well as with peers in the domain relevant to your HP, outside the IDE faculty.
 Coaching skills: being able to collaborate with people from different educational and cultural backgrounds, building a shared way of working, addressing conflicts.
 Reflective attitude/behavior: sharpening their vision and interest areas and formulating ideas for Honours Integration Project.
 Communicating ideas and design intentions to different audiences and with different means, with confidence and flair, both academically and in other aspects of their lives.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36938&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"IO2020-15","Product Dynamics","The course consists of a combination of mechanics (dynamics) and electronics, applied to consumer products. Finalizing this course gives a better insight in designing products, or part of products, while taking the dynamic behavior of the product into account.

The course includes the analysis of dynamic product behavior, modelling of dynamic product behavior, the dimensioning and design of these products, and evaluation of these products.","LG.1: The student knows different types of mechanisms and transmissions, can characterize them abstractly as systems and can model them by means of an analytical function.

LG.2: The student can identify the states, degrees of freedom and boundary conditions (including input/ output, i.e. load profiles) in a product system, and analyse the kinematics of the system, like position, velocity and acceleration over time.

LG.9: The student understands the power of analytical prototyping (predict) over physical prototyping (evaluate).

LG.10: The student knows how and when to apply integration and differentiation to solve the analytical model of the system, and deduce the calculation of physical properties (i.e. moment of inertia).

LG.11: The student has acquired a basic empirical understanding of the related physics and can judge the realism of their calculations.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=37885&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"IO2031","Strategic product innovation","It is important for companies to develop and introduce new products on a regular basis to be profitable and to grow. A central issue for companies concerns which new products need to be developed to be successful. In this course you will learn how to select future directions for a company having achieved solid understanding of several strategic aspects.

Through internal and external analyses you will learn how to assess the strengths and weaknesses of a company and the opportunities and threats it faces in the market. Combinations of these strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats can be evolved into new product ideas and thereby a future strategy for a company. This future strategy also involves choosing the target market (segmentation), positioning products to be developed, and establishing a first direction for the introduction of a new product.

During the course, you will be introduced to several tools and (market) research methods that are available to product developers to guide strategic product innovation decisions. We view this process as filling the product developer's toolbox, out of which one can choose the most appropriate tool depending on the situation and preference.","The learning objectives of SPI relate closely to the activities involved in the course and how the course is assessed. They are based on the steps of the strategic management process with emphasis on the steps unique to industrial designers. As you can see, some learning objectives build on what you learned in previous courses. The test matrix of this course (the relationship between the learning objectives and the assessment) can be found in an overview on BlackBoard.

When you have completed this course, you will be able to:

"ID4336","Leading Strategic Design","This course is about leading strategic foresight looking through a process lens and an actors lens. The process lens covers roadmapping during the front end of innovation. Leading the actors and stakeholders by convincing, canvassing and guiding forms the second lens. Groups of relevant actors for SPD are design teams, management teams, boards, marketers, suppliers and consumers/clients.

The course offers an integrated approach to these two dimensions by combining the rational-analytic and the socio-interactive perspective.
The rational-analytic perspective, often referred to as the 'hard'-side, focuses on steps, phases and issues like planning, budgeting, staffing and reporting. The socio-interactive perspective, referred to as 'soft'-side, covers issues as change & interventions, actor dynamics, conflicts & politics, leadership roles, culture & climate, individual and group (learning) styles, knowledge creation & organizational routines.

In the course we relate these perspectives to the three perspectivice of roadmapping: the market vision, the technology vision and the product vision.

The focus will be on initiating design projects in the (organizational) context that is made up by the various stakeholders: internal & external clients, top & middle management, suppliers, etc.","--Under Construction----
The aim of the course is that:
* Learn to recognize the factors influencing strategic foresight in innovation.
* Learn how to frame and analyse strategic design practice with roadmapping models and concepts.

"ID4330","New Product Economics","Firms must continuously decide which new products to take into development in light of the available resources, developments in the market, and the firm's strategic goals. Making new product decisions is difficult and firms have to deal with various internal (e.g., the existing product portfolio, strategic direction, capabilities of the firm, internal politics) and external (e.g., changes in the market, competitor actions, customer needs) considerations.
Firms aim to select those new product development (NPD) projects that have the largest potential in terms of strategy and economic value, and that support the overall product portfolio. Students will learn how to assess the potential of an individual NPD project with the help of financial models, such as return on investment, net present value and cash flow analysis.

However, the decision to take a product into development should not only be based on a project's expected return. This course will teach students how to build a solid business case for new product selection decisions that includes the economic evaluation, strategic relevance and overall product portfolio of the firm.","At the end of this course students are able to critically financially evaluate new product opportunities and make economically well informed NPD selection, termination and deletion decisions. More specifically, students are able to:

"ID4340","Strategic Value of Design","This course will give insight into the various ways in which design can create value, both at a broader industry level, and the more specific firm level.
At an industry level, we examine how design can contribute to economic performance of product and service firms, explicitly taking environmental and organizational characteristics into account. In addition, we examine how value is ascribed to design by experts, firm management, and users, and which of these parties are most important for success. We study also the wider social-cultural relevance of design, i.e., how design can be appreciated as a form of social-cultural production in that it prescribes, and co-constitutes how people should live and what they could value. Finally, we will examine the various ways in which design has portrayed itself, at different times and in different places, and how this has affected different views on design valuation.
At a firm level, the course will examine different strategies for design management, examining how design can be organized and evaluated depending on the wider context of the firm. We study the potential value that designers can create for the firm, in contrast to other functions in the firm (e.g. marketing, R&D, and other creative functions). In relation to this, we will also address the expressive value of design, i.e. in how it materializes a certain way of operating in the market. Finally, we will examine how a company can optimize the value of design, employing it as a driving force in its innovation efforts, and protecting this value from imitators.","At the end of the course students will be able to:
1. Summarise and compare historic and current developments in theories about the strategic value of design and designers' skills and capabilities

2. Develop, argument and defend their own opinion on the strategic value of design and designers' skills and capabilities

&#8232;3. Formulate a positioning statement and create a related tool/method that embed designers' distinctive skills and capabilities compared to other designers and non-designers working in the area of innovation.

"ID4310","Brand and Product Strategy","The focus of the BPS course is on the relation between new product and service development activities, performed in companies to create competitive advantage, and the company's brand.

The BPS course positions new product and service development as the strategic way companies innovate their offering in the changing competitive environment. It furthermore builds on the theory that corporate and brand identity and the company's core competencies form the internal part of the strategic envelope in which new products should be developed.
Customer motivations and needs, corporate image, brand positioning and the changing competitive environment form external parts of this envelope.
In order to develop products and services successfully, the internal- and the external strategic envelope should become aligned; new products and their related services should build on the company's core competencies and its brand DNA, as well as on opportunities in the market.

BPS students learn what activities a company (should) undertake to develop new product and service development strategies in such a way that it integrates the internal- and the external envelope. In addition to that, the students will learn how to embed these activities in an industrial context by using their design skills. In other words: the students will learn methods to integrate an outside in perspective (customer insights, trends) with an inside out perspective (brand DNA, culture, competencies, capabilities). These methods include brand driven innovation, networked innovation, design thinking, teamwork.

"BM1240","Human Movement Control A: Musculoskeletal Mechanics","The skeletal system of living species provides the shape of the body and enables the transfer of forces required for body movement. The muscles produce the forces to accelerate the body and also substantially contribute to the visco-elasticity of the joints that is needed for stabilization of the skeletal system.
Central in this course are the kinematics of the human skeleton system and the mechanical properties of the human skeletal muscles. The content of the course is strongly based on running research within the Delft Neuromuscular Control Laboratory (NMC-Lab), with a focus on both fundamental aspects (physiology) and clinical applications (patho-physiology). Throughout the course, knowledge about the physiological aspects will be formalized (modeling) and analyzed using model simulations with Matlab/Simulink. Simulations are very useful when the scale of the system becomes larger, i.e. when the degrees of freedom (number of joints and muscles) increase such as in the human shoulder girdle.","After this course the student is able to:

"ID4175","Advanced Embodiment Design","The course Advanced Embodiment Design focuses on the embodiment design phase of the product creation process, which starts from a program of requirements (such as cost, quantity, quality, etc.) and working principles and ends with a validated prototype of a product, which can be physical or virtual as needed. This phase requires the seamless integration of the knowledge of several areas of expertise including theory of embodiment design, ergonomics, product aesthetics and experience, smart systems & technologies, technical concept materialization, sustainable design engineering, and advanced design enablers.

The course trains in an integrated way a well-focused array of competencies in support of an advanced multi-scale systematic research and development methodology for the embodiment design of products of any level of complexity. Structure-wise, design students need to acquire specialised theoretical knowledge offered in areas of expertise, and apply it in all its complexity in a nonlinear real-life project.

1. Theoretical knowledge is organised in areas of expertise, each comprising a number of educational events of appropriate formats (i.e. lectures, exercises and workshops). Feedback moments and tests are scheduled, as appropriate, to assess the competency of students in these clusters. There is an expert instructor assigned to each area, as follows:

- Embodiment Design (project) (E. Karana)
- Applied Ergonomics Feasibility (J. Molenbroek)
- Product Aesthetics & Experience (E. Ozcan)
- Smart Systems & Technologies (M. Hajian)
- Technical Concept Materialization (M. Rajabalinejad)
- Sustainable Design Engineering (R. Wever)
- Advanced Design Enablers (R. Vroom)

2. Simultaneously, with the knowledge of the areas listed above, students are able to tackle a real-life project, commissioned to TU Delft by suitable companies, where branching decision-making and non-linear progression predominate. These projects are completed by students as a part of a team consisting of 4-5 students, in which team work and self-management are trained under supervision by qualified coaches and play a key role. Each team focuses on a different assignment which challenges teams to apply the integrated knowledge gained in the course so far. Teams start to analyse the program of requirements, benchmark existing products, decide on tools and methods to use in their design process and eventually create prototypes to validate their designs. The projects finish with a Technical Data Package, validated prototype (physical or virtual), and a research and development Technical Report/ Scientific Paper, which includes scientific reflection on their design process as well as questions for further research and development.","After completing the course Advanced Embodiment Design the students will be able to:
1.1 Analyse existing products concerning functional, ergonomic, aesthetic, materialisation, production, economical and environmental aspects.
1.2. Analyse a programme of requirements and understand its role in guiding decision making in the embodiment design process.
1.3. Find new embodiment solutions by applying state of the art knowledge, including the application of diverse tools and methods, and to apply analytical knowledge to qualify and select the most appropriate solutions.
1.4. Understand the non-linear nature of design as a dynamic knowledge-based exploration of the design space, in which an abstracted and ambiguous specification evolves into a more concrete product definition through a number of iterative steps.
1.5. Test and evaluate both feasibility and compliance of embodiment solutions, including the final design, to the programme of requirements by the use of prototypes, physical and/ or virtual, selecting the most appropriate method of validation.
1.6. Perform applied research in the context of product development to inform their embodiment solutions, including modelling and (multi-parametric) testing/ simulation.
1.7. Justify their design choices in light of i.e. planned production run, target group, cost of ownership, production planning etc.
1.8. Develop with respect to a given programme of requirements a validated production-ready design out of a proven concept.
1.9. Report the results of the research and development process in a Technical Report/ scientific paper and the product specification in the form of a Technical Data Package (drawings etc).
1.10. Communicate the final results through presentations
1.11. Work both individually and as member of a group in different roles in a real product design project

"ID4265","DfI Research Methodology","The aim of the DfI Master course Research Methodology is to provide reflective insight into design research methods and approaches that are specific to Design for Interaction. The course provides criteria for DfI-specific design research methods and their applicability to different design research challenges. These can be quantitative and qualitative methods. They are often derived from the fields of psychology, physiology, sociology or engineering. The course provides you with pointers on how you as a design researcher can select from these methods to realise Design for Interaction research objectives. The course provides examples of design research projects in the Design for Interaction domain. The course also provides students with the opportunity to discuss and critically assess design research questions, approaches and outcomes.

The course consists of lectures presenting relevant topics and examples, and seminars in which students engage in-depth with DfI research projects by researchers currently working on User Experience inside and outside the IDE faculty.

The course contributes to the skills a DfI graduate needs in order to engage in, set up and lead research projects in industry and academia. The fields that will be addressed are design research for user experience, usability, and user behaviour in various settings. The course specifically addresses the issues of interest to a researcher with a design education. This researcher may apply research approaches that explicitly include designing (Research through Design, Design-inclusive Research). Current developments in design research are highlighted.

To support the students' understanding of the DfI master overall, students reflect on their own research experiences in other DfI projects and courses. Depending on study progress, these might be, for example, Exploring Interactions (ID4250), Interactive Technology Design (ID4220), Usability & User Experience Assessment in Design (ID4256), and Context and Conceptualization (ID4216).","On successful completion of the course the student will have acquired:

the world, designers have a big impact on our environment,
behaviour and well-being. This course is designed
to stimulate a critical reflection on this societal role of
the designer and the student's own design process. This
is achieved by presenting students with ethical, philosophical
and societal ideas about design and showing

"ID4220","Interactive Technology Design","The potential of products equipped with digital technologies like embedded computers, sensors and actuators creates new opportunities and challenges for product designers. The opportunities involve creating products that are aware of the user and of the context of interaction, products that invite tangible and expressive interaction. The challenge in the design of such products lies in designing the appropriate interactive qualities. The development of concepts for interactive products requires a highly iterative design process that involves the making of experiential prototypes from the start. This design-by-making approach serves two purposes: to assess the quality of the design ideas and for the designer to reflect on the appropriateness of the chosen technology. Both goals cannot be attained by thought and the creation of paper concepts.

In the course students are treated to a series of lectures that aim to introduce the appropriate design tools, theoretical background and demonstrate inspiring application concepts. Lecture topics include but are not limited to: interaction design theory, user modelling, max/msp, arduino, interactive architecture, sound design and basic electronics.

Insight into designing new forms of user-product interaction can be gained from a better understanding of human-human communication and human-object interaction in the physical world. In many ways, new product technologies provide a means of merging the physical world with the digital world.","The aim of the ITD course is to provide DFI Masters students with in-depth theoretical and practical interaction design knowledge to help develop future products based on user-product interaction. The course builds on conceptualization skills, interaction design knowledge and technology skills acquired at the Bachelor level. Students gain an understanding of how knowledge can be embedded in a product and how the user can communicate his or her intentions in an expressive way.

"ID5616","Embodied Audio Design","Have you ever wondered...
...why we experience the sound of an electric window in an expensive car as more sophisticated than that of a cheap car?
...how tolerances in the manufacturing process initiate the rattling sound of a food chopper?
...how you can influence the sound by changing constructive parts?
...how you design for the sounds of domestic appliances?
...and what sound tells you about the quality of a product's construction?

Sound is an important aspect in the experience of a product. It also (unconsciously) informs a user if a product is functioning properly. Sound quality can be used to infer product quality. Still, companies often do not consider or envision sound in their design process. Consequently, appliances produce unlikeable sounds and users will complain and sometimes return their products. Therefore, it is important for industrial designers to obtain knowledge how to capture and describe the experiential properties of sound and translate that into a (concept) sound.

In the Embodied Audio Design course you will learn fundamental theories on auditory perception (i.e., psycho-acoustics), and how to apply this knowledge to recording & playback techniques, sound measurements, and sound synthesis approaches. Recording disassembled existing products will inform how individual parts and working mechanisms will contribute to the complete sound. You will learn how to describe and analyze product sound properties. You will learn to express a sound vision and to conceptually analyze it, which will help you to create and evaluate your sound design.

In this quarter we deal with the redesign of a consequential sound. These sounds are the result of their working mechanisms and construction. Therefore, a redesign of these sounds requires an understanding of the contribution of each product part to the total sound, and typically involves suggestions for new parts, materials, or working mechanisms. Former cases include electric toothbrushes, food processors, and prototypes of Philips shavers and the sound of coffeemakers. In this year course we will work to change the sound of coffee grinders together with Philips."," To learn the relation between product quality and sound quality.

"ID5654","Design Roadmapping by Technology & Opportunity Scouting","Timing is of strategic importance in catching opportunities and leveraging on technology inventions. Timing is also crucial when new products are ready for launch. Being among the first can make a large difference in sales and market share. Between initiation and launch, different 'roads' lead to different products and services creations. The pacing and synchronizing of Technology forecast -, Market encounter - and Product evolution plans is a major challenge. A roadmap structures and supports hereby dialogues of cross-communication.

A roadmap for navigating in the car, bringing us from A to B, showing alternative routes, provides a strong metaphor for Design Roadmaps.  Strategy is a journey, purposes are destinations, means are routes, and achievements are landmarks. A design roadmap provides strong visualization and decision support.
This course offers lectures on roadmapping approaches from a Time theory and Design research perspective. The historical background and latest research results are shared. Besides the theoretical concepts, examples of roadmapping will be presented from the experience of design research - and front-end innovation practitioners, including venture managers, technology managers, product- and program managers.

Design Roadmapping includes models and methods addressing:
- Market visions and trend analysis
- Mapping incremental, next generation - and radical innovations;
- Technology scouting and technology visions
- Mapping a product visions roadmap;
- Mapping a project roadmap by constraints.
During the course you will use these models and methods in a roadmapping project assignment.

The main objective of the Design Roadmapping course is to identify and map valuable and appropriate usages for unique technologies in coherence with market opportunities. You will learn how to map and pace an innovation strategy with respect to its competitive context, life cycle evolutions and constraints in resources in order to design a roadmap that supports cross-functional communication.","Design Roadmapping course learning objectives are:

A culture-conscious approach to design is not only a must in order to design products that are meaningful; it is also a wonderful source of inspiration and fun!","With the increasing globalization of product/service design, the ability of designers to understand the culture of their intended users is becoming ever more important.
The goal of this course is to equip you with knowledge and skills that help you to examine culture in design (not related to teamwork or company culture but to the conceptualisation of products). In the course you will discover reasons to study culture, learn about theoretical models, illustrated with examples, and you will learn methods to study culture. And last but not least you will explore possibilities to apply findings in your designs.
The course helps you to envision and formulate your own stance towards cultural factors and cultural differences that you encounter in your design projects.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36881&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"ID5805","Understanding Brand Equity","Every day we are facing an increasing number of products that we can choose from. Brands play an important role in simplifying the decision making process for a consumer. Many companies have come to the realization that brand equity is one of the most valuable assets.
Brands are not only part of our daily life; they also have a strong influence on the market success of new products. This makes the knowledge of branding highly relevant for each industrial designer. In order to design and deliver meaningful brand experiences to your target group or develop a profitable branding strategy for your company, creativity is one of the key ingredients. We believe there is a unique contribution for the industrial designer to make in the brand management process.
This course provides you with a good understanding of brand equity from a marketing perspective. Theoretical models, together with practical examples, will be presented and discussed during the course. A case study will be used to apply your knowledge and insight.
This course is designed as an elective course to provide students with a deeper understanding of the subject of Branding for Master students SPD, DfI and IPD. On completion of this course, students can choose to take the subsequent course: Designing Brand Experiences.","On completing of this course, the student is able to:

"ID5615","Interactive Audio Design","Have you ever wondered...
...how well our hearing system can perceive the feedback sounds of an ATM in a noisy environment?
...what acoustical properties make an alarm sound (in-)appropriate for an emergency situation?
how a Lexus parking signal should be designed?
...how you design these sounds?
how to design a convincing soundscape?
how to express subtle nuances of a sound?
how to transfer the expressivity of a bodily interaction into sound?

Who does not get irritated by feedback or alarm sounds that do not give the experience of quality or sound at improper moments? This happens because many designers and engineers do not have the knowledge on auditory perception and do not know how to design sounds. In addition, sound design is interaction design. If one does not make a good analysis of how the interaction of a user with a product or environment is, one cannot design sounds that fit this interaction. In contrast, animation and game sound designers are highly successful in mimicking and enhancing the interactions on a screen through sound.

In the Interactive Audio Design course you will learn fundamental theories on auditory perception and music psychology, and how to apply this knowledge sound synthesis approaches. You will learn to express a sound vision and to conceptually analyze it, which will help you to create and evaluate your sound design. You will learn how to design a sound for an abstract concept or brand values (like, e.g., sustainability), how you can attribute meaning to a sound (this is parking signal for a car), how you can make sounds that convey a certain sense of urgency.

In this quarter you will design an intentional product sound. These sounds are deliberately added to the product by means of speakers or piezo elements. The function of these sounds is to alarm users, or to provide them with feedback. Therefore, interaction design plays a major role in the sound design process. Cases of previous years included the OV chip-card sounds, and interior sounds for future Toyota and Lexus cars, sounds for control rooms of the European Space Agency, the future Dutch police car, and soundscapes for the Maxima Children's hospital. In this year's course you will design a sound game based on bodily interactions, and communicate your concept through a video. This project will be done in cooperation with STEIM for the Sound Playground (Klankspeeltuin) in the Muziekgebouw in Amsterdam (http://jeugd.muziekgebouw.nl/informatie/Neem_een_kijkje_in_de_Klankspeeltuin/)."," To learn basics sound synthesis techniques, using tools such as vocal sketching, Praat, MaxMSP, Audacity, and Sound Studio.
 To be able to translate experiential aspects (perceptual and emotional) into feedback sounds and soundscapes.
 To learn how to present your sound design ideas.

"ID5565","Sustainable Business Models and Sustainable Product/ Service Systems","The course is oriented at the development of new Sustainable Business Models as an approach for sustainable product/ service innovation, to address complex societal challenges. Sustainable Business Models incorporate a triple bottom line approach (people, planet, profit) and consider a wide range of stakeholder interests, including environment and society; into the way business is done (Bocken et al., 2014).
One of the most well-known examples of Sustainable Business Model Innovation is the Product Service System (PSS) approach (UNEP manual on Design for Sustainability; Crul et al, 2009), which aims at adding value to products by combining in business strategies new services that allow customers to be served with a better system. By focusing on value and function, rather than product attributes and by rethinking the use of physical and organizational infrastructures, industrial design engineers can create new products and services that are competitive, satisfy customer needs and have a lower environmental impact and more positive societal impact than traditional business models (Mont, 2002).
In this course, Sustainable Product Service Systems,' (S-PSS), or 'Creating the Functionality; not ownership', is included as one of the Sustainable Business Model Archetypes that drive positive impact for society and the environment. The eight Sustainable Business Model Archetypes are:
1. Optimise resource efficiency
2. Closing resource loops
3. Substitute with renewables and natural processes
4. Deliver functionality, rather than ownership ('PSS')
5. Adopt a stewardship role
6. Encourage sufficiency
7. Re-purpose the business for society/environment
8. Develop scale-up solutions/ Seek inclusive value creation
(see: Bocken et al., 2014 and www.plan-c.eu/bmix)
This course provides a practical introduction to the methodology of Sustainable Business Model design and an opportunity to develop innovative business and operational models for different organisations (e.g. business, Non-Governmental Organizations). There will be three challenging themes:
1. Sustainable Business Model Innovation in Developed countries
2. Sustainable Business Model Innovation in Developing/ Emerging countries
3. Sustainable Business Model Innovations  transferring lessons-learned from frugal, Jugaad innovations in the developing world to the developed world
Research has shown that co-operation and mutual understanding between creative designers and multiple stakeholders are important conditions for success on the market of these new systems. For instance, in the energy sector a considerable number of sustainable energy technologies already exists and the short and long-term effectiveness of sustainable energy solutions largely relies on the way in which they will be offered for the market and the end users, the type of business model and product/ service offering (Reinders et al., 2012).
The course is oriented on knowledge transfer in the field of entrepreneurship, business development and context specific experts in relation to Sustainable Business Model-innovation and Sustainable Product/ Service Systems.","The course involves achieving the following learning goals. After this course, the students will be able to:
1. Define Sustainable Business Models and Sustainable Product Service Systems and give examples of these;
2. Formulate the conditions, drivers and barriers for implementation of Sustainable Business Models and Sustainable Product Service Systems in practice;
3. Apply relevant theories, methods and tools to the design of Sustainable Business Models and Sustainable Product Service Systems;
4. Assess the potential success of the introduction of your new Sustainable Business Model and Sustainable Product Service System design in practice.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=37918&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"ID5613","Prototyping for Interaction and Participation (PIP)","What PIP is NOT about
In the past, subscribed students thought that PIP is about learning interactive technology. IT IS NOT. In PIP you will NOT be playing with Arduinos and there will be NO programming.

What PIP IS about
PIP is about prototyping INTERACTION (= the way people interact with each other and the world they are in). That is, just like in some DfI courses, PIP is about looking ahead to future interactions people will have.

Usually in design projects, students are focused on the concept they design. In PIP, students are focused on reesarch tools. How do things you use with users, have an effect on insights that can be gained for the future. In PIP, the focus is on the research tools themselves.

So PIP is about making things/interactions that will allow people to look ahead to their future interactions and understand their own and others' perspectives on them.

In PIP usually you will be doing one or more participatory sessions with stakeholders that involves things you generated beforehand. So in PIP you might, for example, design a role play activity, a board game, a visit to a context, or you might even choose existing things and contrast them with other existing things to elicit people's responses to them. It looks at the communication issues that arise in this. PIP offers a framework to reflect on this explicitly, ie what worked, what didn't, and why.

PIP has affinity with the Danish 'Rehearsing the future' principles, check that out here:

You are welcome to check out PIP's own website at http://studiolab.ide.tudelft.nl/pip

Here's a longer explanation about the course:
New products, systems and services increasingly enable people to interact with each other in different and, sometimes, unforeseen ways, thereby being more and more confronted with each other's backgrounds, perspectives and opinions. To better understand these interactions, designers involved with developing such products and services have been involving users and other stakeholders actively and early in the design process through participatory techniques such as contextmapping or generative sessions. While these techniques have primarily focused on generating requirements for the actual designs, a recent trend in design research has started to consider the techniques' value in generating insights into existing or future social situations and structures as well.
The aim of the techniques thus shifts to having the participants and designers experience (part of) these (new) situations from different (stakeholders) perspectives in order to better identify possible opportunities or understand possible conflicts. Designers should facilitate this by bringing in designed artifacts, such as models, objects, movie clips etc. that elicit discussions, provoke statements, negotiate points of view or confront opinions in stakeholder sessions. Artifacts in these sessions are thus not considered as design ends, but as means to 'experience', 'to act upon' or to 'talk about'.
This course is about facilitating stakeholder sessions through the use of artifacts. It researches how design skills can be used to explore and understand complex (social) interactions between people. As such it deepens skills and insights that have been touched on in the EI and ITD courses. The course organizers provide assignments in collaboration with companies and public institutions. Self-defined projects are also possible. Lectures provide examples and background theory from the cutting-edge design research literature. The literature deals with communication issues and with design as a communication tool in social contexts and structures. The course provides a framework for reflection on the course activities as well.","Upon completion of the course, you will have acquired practical experience with and insight into the role of design as a communication tool in social situations and decision-making situations. You will understand better the effectiveness of artifacts as a means to provoke, elicit and facilitate discussion.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36880&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

inclusive design in a case study (groupswork) for
a special population as abovementioned. The student
has experienced interviewing a few persons of her or her
target group about the assignment.","To give an overview of the current state of the phenomena
Inclusive Design, which had alternative names
like Design for All or Universal Design. Inclusive Design
means to strive at the widest possible audience during
and with the design process. It does not mean however
to design for all 7 billion people on earth! It is a next step in the
design for special populations like: older people, lefties
(people using things with their left hand), wheelchair
users, tall people, small people, obese or fat people,
colour blind people, people with dyslexia or RSI, etc.
The effect should be that stigmatisation is avoided
on an elegant manner like in the design of a pair of
glasses, which was an orthesis in the middle age and is
now a good industrial design, which is used to support
someone's lifestyle.
People aged over 65 for example, currently count 15% in the Netherlands but this will grow to 25% in 2050.The designer should know that the number of
lethal home accidents is 5 times higher then
their volume of 15 % in the population. Many accidents
can be influenced by design, but therefore the designer
needs to understand the usage of the everyday things
and the context of these things.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36886&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

The objective is to learn about the strategies, experience applying them and evaluate their effectiveness.","After this course you should be able to:

- Describe the sustainable design strategies (dealt with in the course) and explain the difference between the core concepts, such as: efficient vs. effective, cradle-to-grave vs. cradle-to-cradle, reductionistic vs. holistic;
- Apply the strategies and the associated tools to the design of a sustainable product;
- Critically reflect on the value of the strategies for industrial designers/engineers: their differences, limitations, the solution space they offer, the specific qualities they bring to the design assignment, and their applicability.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36848&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"ID5331","Cognitive Ergonomics for Complex Systems","Cognitive ergonomics is traditionally concerned with mental processes, such as perception, memory, reasoning, and motor response, as they affect interactions among humans and other elements of a system. Relevant topics include mental workload (work stress), decision-making, performance, human-computer interaction, and skill acquisition.

In this course, these topics will be related to, and examined in, the context of complex systems.
Two cases of complex systems will be used throughout the course: 1) the cockpit of a police car, with multiple interfaces and related information sources, and 2) intensive care units, featuring multiple beds surrounded by equipment.

The goal of this course is to apply the acquired knowledge in evaluating existing systems, and implementing this knowledge in user interface design. More specifically, the focus is on harmonising the design of complex systems with multiple users and devices, as opposed to a single user operating one device.","- To gain basic knowledge on the application of cognitive ergonomics in complex systems.
- To use findings from an observational study to set up a lab experiment.
- To relate the findings from a lab experiment to the original context (ecological validity).
- To design a simulation of a complex system and to test this simulation according to the principles acquired in this course.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36820&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"ID5294","Memetic Product Design","Fortuity loves the arts, art loves fortuity, as the Greek saying goes. At this faculty it is normal practice to use your little gray braincells while designing. But as you probably discovered, your brain does not always feel like designing, confronted with an empty piece of white paper. It feels like sleeping, or having fun, or just staring out the window and waiting for 'inspiration'. Sometimes the wait is endless. And how do you design when you are depressed, on a rainy Monday morning, when there is no 'inspiration' in sight?  
 
Why not try a whole different way of designing, where accidental finds pave the way to surprising results? 
 
Main assignments:  
 
1) A paper about the 'Memes' theory by Richard Dawkins, and the importance / implications thereof for you as a designer;  
 
2) The making of collages and assemblies as future references;  
 
3) The creation of different types of rotational symmetrical shapes, using serendipity;

"ID5413","Materials for Design","Materials for Design (MfD) Course is an intrinsically and didactically attractive program with a strong focus on 'material driven design' and 'materials experience'. Students learn a design method to facilitate designing for material experiences when a material is the departure point in the design process. Several projects, workshops and lectures are given to practice the design process when a particular material is the subject of the design effort.

The main aims of the course can be summarized as follows:
- generating knowledge on technical and experiential aspects of materials to be involved in the design process
- creating motivation for using different types of tools and methods in material driven design


The key questions for this course are:
1. How do we design meaningful experiences with and for emerging materials?
2. What are the current technologies and issues in materials for design (e.g. advanced materials, smart materials, bio-based materials, etc.)?
3. What are the tools and methods in understanding, selecting and designing with materials?
4. How can we find a meaningful application for a new material?","At the end of the course, students should
1: Identify the basic components of materials experience

2: Relate these components to technical material properties and other aspects of design (e.g. form, color, process, etc.)

3: Argue the new (emerging) materials and material technologies particularly from 'materials experience' perspective

4: Integrate the materials experience components in their design process

"ID5242","Automotive Design","In a context driven design process, a long-term vision on personal mobility must be formed, that looks further than merely the next generation of vehicles. How will personal travel develop, and how should it be experienced in the future?
From there, including social and cultural aspects, a desired automotive character acts as a guiding principle to design an advanced future concept car; its usage, new technological principles and visual theme.
Next, an intermediate vehicle must be designed, that leads the user from today's automobile to the advanced future concept. The history of automotive form and design, technology and branding strategies, provide a lexicon that guides to design for recognition as well as newness.","Gain insight in the complexity of automotive design and to learn future proof automotive design process, considering the human mobility context. This involves the application and understanding of vision oriented design processes as well as the development of skills.

Meaning & coherence:
Learning how to design inside -> out. Based on what you want to achieve for and with people in the future domain of mobility. The future design is instrumental, inspiring people's behavior, thus triggering the foreseen experience. The desired automotive character in technology, use nd form (expression) must be translated into one coherent design.

Product strategy & product acceptance:
How can a designer contribute in achieving the company's strategy? Learning how to maintain consistency in future product generations (long term), while in the course of that, designing a first next generation that consumers desire (short term).

Appearance & styling:
Learning and understanding that our first confrontation with the car is its overall appearance, styling. Even though that is the final outcome of an in-depth design process, the product must be instantly convincing in its visual expression of character, function and meaning. Understanding of a visual leitmotiv that guides all aesthetic parameters into a coherent whole.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35722&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"ID5292","Vormstudie 4, Zen and the art of Design","'ZEN and the Art of Design'

Rituals
We all have small daily rituals that guide our existence. The way you get out of bed, followed by the way you take a shower. Your coffee break at work, the coffee after dinner, the exchange of presents during Christmas, the eating of a biscuit with sugar sprinkles when a child is born (Dutch ritual), all those smaller or bigger, formal or informal rituals can make a moment more special. Routine is broken, social interactions are guided; the sheer quality of existence is enhanced.

There are many fields where we have lost the basic qualities of life, too hasty as we are to live it. Think of the consuming of fast food instead of a meal of fresh ingredients at a well-laid table, think of playing computer games instead of board games. Think of emails instead of hand written letters, think of preparing your own jam or smoking your own fish, instead of buying it. And how about baking your own bread?

Many qualities have gone lost, and perhaps it is time to treat the lost accompanying rituals like we treat endangered species! We ourselves are the endangered species in this respect.

During this course you will focus on the design of a ritual. Preferably one that may have suffered over time in loosing some, if not all of its former qualities.
Once the ritual has been designed, it is time to start thinking about what products are needed to actually perform the ritual. You will make several scale 1:1 models from several of these products.

At the end you will participate in a group exhibition of the models made. The exhibition takes the place of a normal report.","- The student has acquired knowledge of the principles of traditional Japanese and modern Western minimalistic form giving.

History provides insight into the changing position and role of the styling process, specifically automotive form strategies. Along the way strategic principles and existing management models are introduced and applied.

In addition, two new management tools are educated, that have been developed specifically to strategize form giving. An introduction into the principles of cognition will allow adequate usage of these cognition-based tools, and to detect and understand the meaning of form with respect to brand identity, image and character.

Then objective is to design a brand appropriate form language and convincingly demonstrate its application.

"ID5246","Automotive Design 3D","During this course students can develop the exterior and or interior design of a motor car / automobile or related subject in the field of transportation. The course has a specific approach:

Starting point of this course is the ritual of the use of the object to be designed. What is is mainly used for? Travelling? Shopping? Bringing the children to school?
What dreams should it portray? How can these wishes and dreams be materialized in terms of 'memes'? How can these dreams and wishes be materialized in concrete functional requirements? What 'lifestyle' is the car destined for? Should it be futuristic? Can collages contribute to the understanding and communication of all this?

Then it is time to start thinking about the structure of the car, the 'package'. What engine is needed? Where is it situated? How many seats? In what composition? How much luggage space? Four wheel drive? Wheel size? Overall size? Etc. etc..

Only after having developed these principle ideas, including a user scenario, it is time to develop the embodiment of the car / object, taking all aspects into account.

In other words, the designing starts only after a solid preparation.

To speed up the actual 3d design process, it is started by making small models in ordinary river clay, with a length of ca. 10-15 cm. The idea is that fairly quickly ideas can be researched in terms of value with respect to the formulated principles. (Form study). To really get a grip on the emotive aspects of the design, caricatures might be considered, enlarging the desired qualities to the point of ridicule, to later reduce these to more normal proportions.

Students who do this course (ID5246), do not opt for the scale 1:5 model building and can finalize their process with a 2D rendering of their final design. They will receive 3ECTS. (6 ECTS are only awarded to students who do build a 1:5 3D model in course ID5245).

The area of expertise and of the course can be regarded as a very important element - in terms of exploring and visualizing product design - for students, before entering the professional world. Digitally created or enhanced product drawings are widely applied in design studios and design departments, for reasons of efficiency and creativity.

Various techniques and exercises are offered during the course, applying specific techniques and methodology, and focusing on a certain drawing tempo. The integration of photographic material and product drawings is one of the course aspects.

"ID5214","Interactive Formgiving","Design is an important means to make the future experiential and address the promises and pitfalls of emerging technologies, the social practices and rituals these technologies may bring us and how they might transform our bodies, self-perceptions and everyday behaviors. To do so, designers need tools and techniques to shape and investigate future interaction styles and interaction paradigms that are made possible by these emerging technologies.

To explore such future interactions and interaction styles early in a product design process, is important that they become experiential in their embodiment and that critical details are addressed at various levels of expression. Existing techniques, such as body storming, interaction relabeling and physical prototyping are useful to ideate interaction styles aesthetically, but fall short when addressing how products will actually respond to users actions and how actions and feedback precisely integrate. To explore the flow of the interaction at this level of detail and nuance, other skills, tools and techniques are thus required.

The focus of the elective 'Interactive Formgiving' is on the 'how' of interaction: the exploration and visualisation of interaction styles on the level of the body (direct interaction, sensuous engagement) and the self (meanings and emotions). Students will be taught through a series of lectures, hands-on workshops and assignments to use and combine (1) physical modelling, (2) animation, (3) video compositing and editing, and 4) sound composition and editing to explore and communicate interaction styles in the conceptual stage of a design process without the use of interactive technology, such as programming, electronics, arduinos etc."," To understand interactions in terms of styles where qualities in experience are meaningfully connected to properties of the interaction.
 To conceptualise interactions in terms of function, form and flow.
 To explore interactions by enacting experiences through materials.
 To create interactions by combining techniques addressing function, form and flow.

"ID5213","Socially Tangible Media","Living in a digital world where human beings, everyday objects, and digital services are increasingly interconnected is a fundamental challenge for interaction designers today. Questions arise for interaction designers concerning how technology can help us manage our availability to others, and how the social practices that are needed to help us live in a connected world relate to our practices in the physical world.

In this course, students will explore how to frame the role that a physical object can play in a digital network and how to design the qualities of interaction with an object that connects to social data. This will be achieved through the ideation and development of design concepts.","By the end of the course students should be able to:

 Identify, describe and analyze existing examples of socially tangible media
 Collect and apply relevant knowledge in designing socially tangible media

"ID5212","Experiencing Persuasive Environments","Persuasion is a form of interaction that aims at changing the way people think or behave. Inspired by Fogg's definition of persuasive technology, we interpret design for persuasive environments as:
(1) an attempt to change attitudes or behaviour or both without coercion or deception,
(2) a focus on humans interacting with and in (social, physical and virtual) environments and the products in the environments
(3) a focus on planned persuasive effects,
(4) a focus on endogenous or 'built-in' persuasive intent, which means that an environment or product is intentionally designed to persuade, and
(5) persuasion that may take place at either the macro or the micro level.

The course will deal with issues like:
Designing for behavioural change, mechanisms and conditions for persuasion, play and games as motivators, ethics of persuasive design, persuasion focusing on specific target behaviours versus design for providing opportunities for behavioural change, the role of experiences in driving people's behaviour, persuasion in public environments.","- Theoretical and practical knowledge about the concepts persuasiveness, experience and environments; and how these can influence each other

- Basic knowledge about and some initial experience with the implications of various types of environments (technical, virtual, social, physical) for experience and persuasive design","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36825&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"ID5185","Design for children's play","This course focuses on what designers need to know about children in order to cater for their play needs, and how to apply this knowledge in the design of children's products with great play value.
Every child goes through approximately the same stages of development, but that development makes every child change in a fast pace. Knowledge on the physical, cognitive and social-emotional growth of children contributes to adequate product development for them.
Play is a unique activity. Toys are a tool for play, and knowledge of the characteristics and qualities of play supports the design of these tools.
Play is also a form of self-motivated exploration. Thus, tools for play can also be considered as tools for informal learning.
In the course, we will bring knowledge areas like theories of play, child development and contemporary child culture into the realm of design for children's play. You will develop design ideas for play products. You will also execute one session with English-speaking children from an international primary school to evaluate your design ideas.","The objectives of this course are:

Marketing and Market information
After initial exploration of the basic concepts this section will deal with buying behaviour of organisations. In order to build and develop a relationship it is crucial to know how the customer organisation has organised its purchasing function. Information systems can play an important supporting role. In addition, industrial market research, which is characterised by its qualitative nature, is vital as well. Fuzzy marketing will also be addressed.

Industrial Buying Behaviour
Selling includes the anticipation of purchasing decision of an industrial client. This is especially true for technical or technological products. The 'Decision Making Unit' will be dealt with.

"EE8002","Literature Study for Electrical Enginering","One of the most important aspects in the scientific environment is bringing your results to the wide public. In this case, the wide public is represented by the scientific community, a group with very high expectations and strict rules. Having your message heard is primarily determined by effectuating quality research, but is also highly conditioned by adhering to the communication conventions that apply in this community.

The 'Literature Study for Electrical Engineering' will offer you a guided tour in the art (or trade) of preparing quality scientific publications. You will do these first steps by 'learning on the job': reading articles and consulting reference templates for scientific publications, with an emphasis on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) styled articles. To this end, you will be given a recent IEEE Transactions article in a field that is on one of our faculty's main research lines. You will then have to analyse this article, by also placing it in its context (consulting related references) and assess its main strengths, its novelty and, possibly, its weaknesses. Your analysis will then be reported in about 4 pages, double column, essay formatted according to the IEEE Transactions style. The essay will have to be submitted electronically, as a PDF file, within 5 weeks from the moment when you will be given the task to i.e.lager@tudelft.nl and will be assessed with a 'sufficient'/'insufficient' system.","Critically acquiring information from peer reviewed literature

"ID5115","Lighting Design","With advancements in technologies, new opportunities are made available to enhance our environments. Examples of such major developments in lighting technologies are wide-spread application of LED lighting in not just armatures but for instance also architectural elements and industrial products, daylighting systems, the use of LCDs for lighting/view simulation, OLED lighting, interactive dynamical materials such as e-paper, light emitting materials, and photonic textiles. These generate new potentials to apply lighting in our public spaces for functional (e.g. visibility, safety, wayfinding), aesthetical (attractiveness, beauty, light art), and commercial (branding, atmosphere creation) purposes. Additionally, they allow to create smart environments in which the light may come from anywhere around us (the sources being not just lamps), creating ambiances or luminous environments, influencing our brain visually and non-visually and thereby our affects, cognitions behavior and (mental) health.

The willingness to create training facilities in this subject resulted in an inter-disciplinary studio with academics and professionals covering various fields from the 'hard' technologies to 'soft' perceptions, namely lighting designers from BeersNielsen, ipv Delft, Deerns, Philips, ERCO, NDT, consultants from NSVV, and professors from the faculty of Architecture.","Students will be able to describe and visualize light in a systematical manner, within a framework of qualitative, perception based lighting design.

"ID5112","Advanced supply based design","The course ID5112 is the next step in B2B Marketing, design and supply management at the Technical University Delft. The course 'Advanced supply based design' builds on the idea that designing products means integrating knowledge from the supply chain. Production methods, material requirements, competences of personnel, retail capabilities, finance and logistics are all important aspects in design and most of these aspects are not in the power of the designer. They are hidden somewhere in the chain and it is the strategic designer that has to release them !

In the course Business Marketing for Engineers (ID5131) we have been discussing marketing in supply chains a lot. In this course we want to go one step further ! We want to design a fully demand pulled chain, with only the bare necessary activities and processes in place for the right design. We start from the final user of a product (service), meaning that we differentiate between customers (payers) and consumers (users). Thinking of the Value Underneath, this means that we think from the 'value in use' (Vargo and Lusch) and steer the necessary activities from this value point, pulling only necessary, value adding activities towards the designed end result. We will have to extract the information form the end user towards a logical decoupling point in the chain.","On the knowledge side, the students know (after the course) about:
 the basic forms of relationships (in chains, networks and dyads)

"EE3L11","Bachelor graduation project Electrical Engineering","The 'Bachelor graduation project' is a complex educational activity offering the students the possibility to materialise the knowledge and practical skills accumulated during the complete Bachelor curriculum in a design project in the area of Electrical Engineering. The students are expected to go through the complete design process, from drawing up a set of requirements, through the concept analysis and design, concept selection, to the presentation of the final design, in a structured and iterative manner. For stimulating an entrepreneurial spirit, the graduation project also requires the students to write a business plan describing how the technology can be transformed into some commercial product. In view of the prime importance of the societal awareness for the future engineers, the students will be also involved in an 'Ethics and technique' module that will discuss responsibility, ethical theories, ethical dilemmas in companies, taking decisions in an environment of uncertainty, ethics and law etc. The module's expected effect is to train students to think about their role as future engineers and be able to raise their voice and participate in moral debates in their future occupation.

The project is to be carried out in groups of 6 students (groups consisting of less students may also be accepted in some special, well justified, cases). The group's task is approached concurrently by 3 or 2 sub-groups that address specific aspects or components of the given assignment. Each sub-group is required to draw a thesis (one per sub-group) that must then be defended in front of a jury consisting of specialists in the area (see below). The complete group must also jointly prepare one Business Plan that must be presented and advocated during a competition termed 'Grand Finale'.

The 'Bachelor graduation project' is carried out, as a rule, in the fourth quarter of the third year (the 'main entry point'). Access to this discipline is only granted upon fully completing the curriculum for the first two years. For those not reaching the access requirements (see below) at the reference moment for getting access to the activity, a second round will be scheduled during the second quarter of the next year (the 'alternative entry point'). The entry requirement for this point the Bachelor curriculum, except for EE3L11. The reference moments are: the end of the first semester for the 'main entry point'; the beginning of the first semester for the 'alternative entry point'.

This discipline consists of 3 modules: 'Bachelor thesis', 'Business Plan' and 'Ethics and technique'. The credits are granted as follows: 10 ECTS for the Bachelor thesis itself, 3 ECTS for the 'Business Plan' module and 2 ECTS for the 'Ethics and technique' module.","Apply, integrate and deepen the electro-technical knowledge accumulated in the previous study years.

"WM1135TU","English for Academic Purposes-4","General description

This course is taught at the CEF (Common European Framework) level known as C1.

English for Academic Purposes 4 (EAP 4 / WM1135TU) is the highest level general skills course offered by the English Unit within the ITAV institute at TPM. It is designed for those who have a thorough knowledge of English grammar, vocabulary, writing and speaking who can easily cope in the English-medium academic environment but who still wish to further perfect their proficiency in order to become more adept in both the written and spoken modes. In this 14-week course (2 hours a week plus 2 hours of homework assignments per week), the focus is on the two active skills of speaking and writing. Time will be devoted to:

Academic writing style, register and word forms
Vocabulary and collocations
Grammar, punctuation and the relevant conventions
The compilation of paragraphs and essays
Effective vocabulary and language learning strategies
The various principles of pronunciation

The groups tend to be small. The sessions are highly interactive, which is conducive to rapidly improving one's general standard of English.

Prior to embarking on the course it is necessary to sit the Placement Test. Alternatively those who have previously completed either the EAP3 (WM1101TU) or the WET2 (WM1102TU) course may be automatically admitted to EAP4 provided that a final grade of 7.0 or higher was achieved in such a previous course.

Osiris registration is not a pre-requisite.

Courses begin in the first week of September (Q1)and in the first week of February (Q3). Please see the website for Placement Test dates and for any further course details: http://www.tc.tbm.tudelft.nl","By the end of the course you should feel that you are able to understand a wide range of complex texts and recognise implicit meaning. You should furthermore have become good at expressing yourself fluently and spontaneously without any excessive need to search for the correct phrasing. By the end of the course participants will generally find that they are able to use the language appropriately and effectively in various social, academic and professional settings.

"WB2414-09","Mechatronic System Design","Mechatronic system design deals with the design of controlled motion systems by the integration of functional elements from a multitude of disciplines. It starts with thinking how the required function can be realised by the combination of different subsystems according to a Systems Engineering approach (V-model).

It should be noted that the control principles used in this course place a strong emphasis on frequency domain methods by linearising the system at its working point with the use of Bode- and Nyquist plots. The main reason for this emphasis is the strong focus in other control related courses on (non-linear) time domain related methods while linearised frequency domain related methods are still dominantly applied in the industry. A mechatronic engineer should be able to work with both methods and use them where appropriate.

Some supporting disciplines, like power-electronics and electromechanics, are not part of the BSc program of mechanical engineers. For this reason this course introduces these disciplines in connection with mechanical dynamics and PID-motion control principles to realise an optimally designed motion system.

The target application for the lectures are motion systems that combine high speed movements with extreme precision.

The course covers the following four main subjects:

1: Dynamics of motion systems in the time and frequency domain, including analytical frequency transfer functions that are represented in Bode and Nyquist plots.

2: Motion control in the frequency domain with PID-feedback and model-based feedforward control-principles that effectively deal with the mechanical dynamic anomalies (resonances and eigenmodes) of the plant.

3: Electromechanical actuators, mainly based on the electromagnetic Lorentz principle. Reluctance force and piezoelectric actuators will be shortly presented to complete the overview.

4: Power electronics that are used for driving electromagnetic actuators.

The fifth relevant discipline, position measurement systems is dealt with in another course: WB2303, Electronics and measurement.

The most important educational element that will be addressed is the necessary knowledge of the physical phenomena that act on motion systems, to be able to critically judge results obtained with simulation software.
The lectures challenge the capability of students to match simulation models with reality, to translate a real system into a sufficiently simplified dynamic model and use the derived dynamic properties to design a suitable, practically realiseable controller.
This course increases the understanding what a position control system does in reality in terms of virtual mechanical properties like stiffness and damping that are added to the mechanical plant by a closed loop feedback controller.

It is shown how a motion system can be analysed and modelled top-down with approximating (scalar and linearised) calculations by hand, giving a sufficient feel of the problem to make valuable concept design decisions in an early stage.
With this method students learn to work more efficiently by starting their design with a quick and dirty global analysis to prove feasibility or direct further detailed modelling in specific problem areas.","Can analyse and derive improvements to the dynamic behaviour of an actuator-driven mechanical structure with maximum 6th order plant dynamics (incl actuator and amplifier) by means of Bode and Nyquist plots.

Can select and calculate a single-axis functional electromagnetic actuator for a given specification, working according to the Lorentz force generation principle.

"SC4092","Modelling and Nonlinear Systems Theory","Based on the analogies between the physical laws and energy flows of electrical, mechanical, hydraulical, and thermal components, a systematic modelings approach is developed to describe the dynamic behavior of a large class of physical systems. The resulting nonlinear differential equations are represented as nonlinear state space models and are used to study various qualitative aspects.

The first fundamental topic to be treated is concerned with the study of the system's internal behavior via Lyapunov stability theory. The extension of Lyapunov stability theory to systems with inputs and outputs will be accomplished by the introduction of the concept of dissipative systems. The two main examples of dissipative systems are passive systems and nonlinear control systems having finite input-output L2-induced norm. Important results, such as the small-gain theorem, are highlighted and implications towards the stability analysis of large-scale physical systems, as well as to the robustness of stability with respect to unmodeled dynamics are discussed.

Another main topic concerns the extension of the controllability and observability concepts to nonlinear control systems. The key ingredients to analyze controllability of a nonlinear system are the so-called Lie brackets of the associated system vector fields. Observability can be analyzed by considering the (repeated) Lie derivatives of the output mapping with respect to the system vector fields. The necessary mathematical preliminaries are introduced during the lectures.

In the last part of the course, the problem of transforming a nonlinear control system by feedback transformations and the choice of state space coordinates into a linear control system is discussed. It turns out that for controllable systems an elegant 'if and only if' condition can be given, stated in terms of the involutivity of certain Lie bracket expressions of the system vector fields. Applications with respect to control problems such as tracking of desired output trajectories will be provided.

All topics will be illustrated by examples from various application domains, in particular actuated mechanical systems (robotics), electrical circuits (power converters), mechatronics (electric and magnetic transducers), hydraulic systems (interconnected tanks) and process (heat exchanger) systems.","The purpose of the course is to introduce the students to basic concepts and results in physical modeling and the theory of nonlinear control systems.

- construct models of systems from the knowledge of physics, with an emphasize on the internal energy of the system.

"SC4210","Vehicle Mechatronics","In the modern cars, electronic components, hence mechatronic components and systems are more and more embedded in the vehicle, especially in the areas of entertainment, driving comfort, engine management and active safety. Currently about 30% of the cost of a car can be contributed to electronic components and it is expected that this trend will continue in the years to come, since the car manufacturers are further improving the functionality of these systems. The introduction of electronic stability programs (ESP) has greatly contributed to road safety and more cars will be equipped with ESP and more advanced ESP systems are being developed. Besides safety, electronics can also contribute to influencing the driving behaviour of the vehicle, creating an even stronger brand identity (e.g., safety, fun to drive, etc.). In order to accomplish this, new control architectures need to be developed such as Global Chassis Control. It may be clear that by introducing electronics in vehicles it is paramount to focus on the robustness and reliability of embedded mechatronic components and systems.
The Vehicle Mechatronics course will focus on this trend with special attention to the integration of the electrical and mechanical domains (mechatronics) and the control aspects of the vehicle and its sub-systems. The following car systems will be reviewed; steering, braking, suspension, engine & powertrain and tires.

"SC4060","Predictive and adaptive control","Adaptive Control covers a set of techniques which provide a systematic approach for automatic adjustment of the controllers in real time, in order to achieve or to maintain a desired level of performance of the control system when the parameters of the plant dynamic model are unknown and/or change in time. Predictive control focuses on the optimization of a performance index with respect to some future control sequence, using predictions of the output signal based on a process model, coping with amplitude constraints on inputs, outputs and states. One-step ahead predictive controllers enjoy the nice feature that they can cope with the effect of parameter uncertainty upon the performance of the control system. The course presents a basic ground for analysis and design of adaptive and predictive control systems. After an introductory part and an initiation to parameter adaptation algorithms, Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) and Self-Tuning Control (STC) schemes constitute the core part of the course. These techniques are based on one-step ahead predictive strategies, namely model reference and single-step control. Stability analysis in a deterministic environment and convergence analysis in a stochastic environment are both dealt with. Due to historical reasons, the Model Reference Adaptive control will be formulated in a deterministic setting, while the Self-tuning Control in a discrete-time stochastic setting.

By measuring the fields or particles after they have traveled through an object, the goal is to retrieve the location of this object or its internal constitution or both.

"ET8020","Diag. for High Voltage Assets and Lab.","The quality of the insulation of high voltage components (assets) e.g. transformers, cables, switch-gear, generators, is of large importance for the availability and reliability of power supply. Prior to service operation and in accordance with international standards all these components are heavily tested at different voltage stresses (HVDC, AC, Impulse). During the service life of 30 or more years local insulation defects (on mm-scale) occurring as a result of aging and degradation may produce a total blackout e.g. of a 3 km long power cable connection. To provide during continuous service high reliability level, insulation condition assessment by means of advanced and non-destructive diagnostics is very important. In particular, by means of advanced sensor techniques, signal processing, knowledge rules, the condition of the components has to be continuously or periodically monitored. The liberalization of energy sector, requests from the network providers an economic responsible technical management of the assets. In particular, based on the actual condition, the maintenance strategies have to be implemented. This course, supported by demonstrations, learns about the different voltage generation, diagnostics and monitoring techniques, weakest link statistics, knowledge rules generation, diagnosis support systems for asset management are shown.","To obtain insight in the testing, diagnostics of HV components and be able to understand the processes of insulation-coordination and quality insurance by maintenance strategies.

Central features of the models will be discussed are random variables, probability density functions, and the expected value operator.

"IN4333","Language Engineering Project","'Software systems are the engines of modern information society. Our ability to cope with the increasing complexity of software systems is limited by the programming languages we use to build them. Bridging the gap between domain concepts and the implementation of these concepts in a programming language is one of the core challenges of software engineering. Modern programming languages have considerably reduced this gap, but often still require low-level programmatic encodings of domain concepts. Or as Alan Perlis formulated it in one of his famous epigrams: 'A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant'. A fixed set of (Turing Complete) programming constructs is sufficient to express all possible computations, but at the expense of considerable encoding that obfuscates the concepts under consideration. Linguistic abstraction can be used as a tool to capture our emerging understanding of domains of computation.' (Visser, SCP 2014)

In the precursor compiler construction course (IN4303), students learn the basics of language engineering and build a complete definition for a small programming language. In this course, students learn to apply language engineering principles and tools to a real (domain-specific) programming language in a new project, i.e. without following a path set out in detail by the instructor. Thus, they will experience that the design of a real programming languages requires trade-offs and compromises. Typically, students implement a previously existing language. But designing a new language is also an option provided there is a good plan that is discussed _before_ the course starts.","Learn to apply language engineering principles and tools to a real (domain-specific) programming language.

"IN4253ET","'Hacking Lab'-Applied Security Analysis","The security of computer and telecommunication systems is becoming an increasing concern. In this course, we will review the current state of the art on security research and gain practical experience in assessing the security and vulnerabilities of communication systems. Engineers are typically taught to focus on performance, correctness, scalability, and maintainability when building communication and information processing systems. However, an additional set of design principles are required to achieve security. In this course, we discuss security principles, common pitfalls and vulnerabilities.

The weekly lectures provide an introduction into security research, with a focus on real-world security, privacy-enhancing technology and common security pitfalls.

Each student participates in a 'Hack Project', with a group of one to four students. Students can select between a wide range of available Hack Project outlines within the first week. The goal may be to evaluate the security of a real-world IT system, developing a proof-of-concept exposing a vulnerability or focussed on preserving privacy in a post-Snowden world. Students may propose their own Hack Project based on their background knowledge and skills. Such Hack Projects need to be approved and shaped together with the instructor. Example of possible outlined hardware-oriented projects are: development of a wifi tracker, programing an FPGA system to break passwords, assess the security of RFID cards, or to transparently intercept Ethernet traffic. Concrete software projects are: hacking Bitcoin, improving the TOR anonymity protocol and create Android-based tools for human rights activists in Iran, Egypt and Russia.

Each Hack Project is documented with a written report. This can be in the form of a 6-8 page IEEE-style scientific article or a traditional more lengthy report. All results, experiences and findings are presented to the entire class in the last week of the course. Hack Projects also report their progress several times during the course, after the weekly lectures.","After this course, the student will have a thorough knowledge of security in real-world systems, and will be able to explore the literature on this topic independently.

Cybersecurity and ethics are highly interconnected as many security measures and mechanisms have ethical implications. There is the ethical debate about the trade-off whether to safeguard the common good for the society or to ensure the rights of the individuals. Governments should determine their role in security, is ensuring cybersecurity left to the individual and companies or does the government play a role in warranting societal values? These need to be carefully balanced and often compromises are necessary.

In cyberspace ethical dillemma's are often connected to the distribution of access to information, e.g. who can access personal data. Another important part of the module will discuss the tension between human and constitutional rights violations (freedom, privacy and accountability) in addressing the threats.","After completing this course the student can:

"SPM5441","Cyber Risk Management","MOTIVATION:
The challenge of selecting the optimal technical, organisational, legal, and other preventive and repressive measures to reduce cyber risks to acceptable levels can only be understood in the context of the application of Cyber Risk Management. Risk Management is about analysing the relationships between threats, incidents and risks (here in the complex world of cyberspace), based on which an adequate set of countermeasures can be designed.

SYNOPSIS:
Risk (= the potential lo loosing something of value) can manifest itself in cyberspace in all kinds of ways: values at stake are financial wealth, health, physical condition (of people, materials, goods, infrastruc-tures, etc.), well-being, reputation, privacy, trust, etc.
Based on a conceptualisation of cyberspace and its various sub-domains (discussed in the project week of year 1), we introduce risk assessment approaches, both of qualitative and quantitative manner, illustrated with case studies, a.o., related to a set of well-known real-world cyber security incidents. In addition, technical and non-technical cyber risk mitigation strategies are being introduced and discussed.

"IN4176","Functional Genomics and Systems Biology","Molecular biology is concerned with the study of the presence of and interactions between molecules, at the cellular and sub-cellular level. In bioinformatics and systems biology, algorithms and tools are developed to model these interactions, with various goals: predicting yet unobserved interactions, assigning functions to yet unknown molecules through their relations with known molecules; predicting certain phenotypes such as diseases; or just to build up biological knowledge in a structured way.

Such interaction models are often best modelled as networks or graphs, which opens up the possibility of using a large number of readily available algorithms for inferring networks, performing simulations of biology, optimising paths or flows through networks, graph-based data integration and graph mining. Many of these algorithms can be applied (sometimes with slight alterations) to solve a particular biological problem, such as modeling transcriptional regulation or predicting protein interaction/complex formation, but also to derive systems behaviour by breaking down networks into modules or motifs with certain characteristics.

In this course, we will first give a brief overview of molecular biology, the advent of high-throughput measurement techniques and large databases containing biological knowledge, and the importance of networks to model all this. We will highlight a number of peculiar features of biological networks. Next, a number of basic network models (linear, Boolean, Bayesian) will be discussed, as well as methods of inferring these from observed measurement data. Building on the network inference methods, a number of ways of integrating various data sources and databases to refine biological networks will be discussed, with specific attention to the use of sequence information to refine transcription regulation networks. Finally, we will give some examples of algorithms exploiting the networks found to learn about biology, specifically for inspecting protein interaction networks and for finding active subnetworks.","After succesfully completing this course, a student is able to: list the basic elements of a living cell and their interactions, and describe how these can be measured; explain what type of mathematical model is applicable to what measurement(s), at what level(s), in a given systems biology problem; read and comment upon recent network-based computational biology literature; discuss the state-of-the-art in systems biology and integrative bioinformatics, and future challenges.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36707&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

Cloud computing has emerged in the past few years as an IT paradigm in which the infrastructure, the platform, and even the software used by IT operations are outsourced services. Departing from the IT services of the past two decades, cloud services can flexibly be used when and only for how long they are needed, and leased for prices charged in small increments of actual usage. The cloud computing model impacts favorably the operation of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), by reducing the initial investment in IT and the maintenance overheads, and by allowing SMEs to focus on developing their core technology and business, rather than becoming expert IT operators. There are currently hundreds of commercial cloud-based service providers, such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and SalesForce. This course focuses on the cloud computing paradigm.

"ET4076-11","VLSI Test Technology & Reliability","With the continuous scaling of transistor feature sizes, the VLSI chip density is exponentially increasing. This results in a significant complexity of today's and future VLSI technology; such a complexity has reached the point where billions of transistors are integrated on a single chip (as it is the case for System on Chip). To guarantee customer's satisfaction, produced VLSI chips have to be reliable and fully tested. Verification and production testing represent 50 to 60% of the chips production total cost, and are now the biggest cost of the technology. It has been known for a while that tackling problems associated with testing VLSI chips at earlier design stage levels significantly reduces the testing cost.

"ET4054","Methods and Algorithms for System Design","System design is the central topic of this course. We move beyond the methods developed in circuit design (although we shall have interest in those) and consider situations in which the functional behavior of a system is the first object under consideration. There will be an introduction to modeling methods that can be used in the context of system design, followed by a discussion of the main issues that are to be considered when one want to design a system that satisfies a number of relevant performance indices. We start out with a classical situation in which topics such as space, time and processing cycle are the objects to be optimized on. This will lead to a quest for a variety of optimization methods depending on what kind of information can be assumed chosen and on which data the optimization procedure is going to be executed on. Optimization theory and operations research will always be right around the corner. The particular topics to be covered are:

- Optimization in time and space: we consider this classical problem as it arises in systems synthesis.
- Various methods for scheduling and resource binding will be considered.
- Timing optimization and retiming of state machines: we consider the problem of optimizing a state diagram and timing behavior in the context of the signal flow diagram of a sequential system.
- Algorithmic complexity and the NP problem: we encounter the problem of algorithmic complexity and how meaningful statements can be made about it.
- Static timimg analyzes.

The way we intend to run the course is as follows:
- We follow the main topics in our textbooks. It covers pretty much the material needed. We do that by agreeing to read before class, discuss problems in the book, and work out systematic questions from it.
- One laboratory exercise.
- We read a relevant paper from the literature.

"WI4226","Advanced System Theory","Part I

In part I of this course the connection of linear system theory and convex optimization is illustrated. One of the key ingredients are the so-called Linear Matrix Inequalities, LMI's for short. LMI's can be treated efficiently by means of semi-definite programming techniques coming from convex optimization.

It turns out that many properties of linear systems, like stability, controllability, observability, etc., can be formulated in terms of LMI's. Also the design of controllers satisfying stability and other constraints can be done efficiently using semi-definite programming and LMI's. The first part of part I starts by recalling basic knowledge from linear system theory and placing it in the frame work of LMI's.

A second topic in part I will be LQ optimal control and the introduction of dissipativity. Both topics are of crucial importance for system theory. LQ optimal control has a long and rich history, but is still important and applicable. Dissipativity also has a long history, but its applicability has increased in recent years by the event of new efficient algorithms to solve semi-definite programming problems.

The last topic in part I are system norms and the design of a controller such that the combined system behaves in a desired way specified in terms of its norm. To that end, the H-infinity and the H2 norm will be introduced. Also methods will be treated which it can be investigated whether a certain desired norm can be achieved, and how this then actually can be done by means of state or output feedback.

Part II

The first fundamental topic to be treated in part II of the course is concerned with the controllability and observability concepts to nonlinear control systems. The key ingredients to analyze controllability of a nonlinear system are the so-called Lie brackets of the associated system vector fields. Observability can be analyzed by considering the (repeated) Lie derivatives of the output mapping with respect to the system vector fields. The necessary mathematical preliminaries are introduced during the lectures.

In the second part of the course, a variety of modelling and analysis techniques that uses energy as a starting point is presented. Apart from the fact that energy is a fundamental concept in physics, there are several motivations for adopting an energy-based perspective in modeling physical systems. First, since a physical system can be viewed as a set of simpler subsystems that exchange energy among themselves and the environment, it is common to view dynamical systems as energy-transformation devices. Secondly, energy is neither allied to a particular physical domain nor restricted to linear elements and systems. In fact, energies from different domains can be combined simply by adding up the individual energy contributions. Thirdly, energy can serve as a lingua franca to facilitate communication among scientists and engineers from different fields. Lastly, the role of energy and the interconnections between subsystems provide the basis for various control strategies.","Advance system theory deals with the extensions in /of linear system theory.

"WI4209","Systems and Control","The main objects of study in this course are systems modeled by linear time-invariant differential equations. We start with a treatment of the theory of algebraic representation of dynamical systems using polynomial matrices. The main tool is the Euclidean algorithm applied to matrices of real polynomials. The main result is a complete characterization of all representations of a given system. Several other representation are introduced along with their relations. Important examples of such representation are input-output representations that reveal that some variables may be unrestricted by the equations, and state space representations that visualize the separation of past and future, also referred to as the Markov property. Controllability and observability are important system theoretic concepts. A controllable system has the property that a desired future behavior can always be obtained, independent of the past behavior, provided that this future behavior is compatible with the laws of the system. Observability means that the complete behavior may be reconstructed from incomplete observations. The theory of controllability and observability forms one of the highlights of the course. Stability can be an important and desirable property of a system. Stabilization by static or dynamic feedback is one of the key features of Systems and Control. In the pole placement theorem linear algebraic methods and the notion of controllability are used in their full strength. The theorem, loosely speaking, says that in a controllable system the dynamic behavior can be changed as desired, in terms of characteristic values, by using appropriate feedback. It forms one of the most elegant results of the course and indeed of the field of Systems and Control.","Mathematical systems theory is concerned with problems related to dynamic phenomena in interaction with their environment. These problems include:
 Modeling. Obtaining a mathematical model that reflects the main features. A mathematical model may be represented by difference or differential equations, but also by inequalities, algebraic equations, and logical constraints.
 Analysis and simulation of the mathematical model.
 Prediction and estimation.
 Control. By choosing inputs or, more general, by imposing additional constraints on some of the variables, the system may be influenced so as to obtain certain desired behavior. Feedback is an important example of control.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36588&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"WI4219","Discrete Optimization","Discrete Optimization is about the problem of finding a best solution among a set of feasible solutions. The set of feasible solutions might be astronomically large but is assumed to be discrete (finite or countably infinite), which also constitutes the major difference to Continuous Optimization.

Yet another example is linear programming, which can be interpreted as the problem of finding a best among a finite number of vertices of a polyhedron.

"WM0935TU","The Political Use of Models in Sustainable Development","In this course you will learn how mathematical models, and science in general, are used in real-world policy making by others than mathematicians (e.g. companies, policymakers, societal groups etc). This is important since it helps you prepare for your future working context. Mathematical models play an important role in dealing with a great variety of societal phenomena. Models play an important role as they enable us to discover phenomena that could hardly be perceived otherwise, they allow us to make forecast about the future development of e.g. problematic phenomena like climate change or sea level rise, they facilitate optimizing inefficient technologies and they allow us to estimate the effects of policy measures. Policymakers need science to provide the 'facts' that support and guide their strategies and decisions. They need models especially for issues that involve (scientific) uncertainties, complexity and long-term perspectives. As a mathematician, you need to understand how others may (mis)use your models or model outcomes in order to anticipate and respond properly. For this, you need to understand that there is a different way of thinking within the scientific domain, where mathematical models are generally being developed, than in the political and market domain. For instance, as the outcomes of a model may be unfavourable to particular people or organisations and beneficial to others, the model itself may get controversial.","The learning objective of this course is to be able after this course to reflect on the role that science, and mathematical models in particular, play in policy making on wicked policy problems. More specifically, the objectives are:
1. To be able to explain in your own words what a 'wicked' policy issue is.
2. To be able to explain in your own words why the role of science -mathematical models in particular- for decision making on wicked policy problems is complex.
3. To be able to explain in your own words what the role and type of science is that is needed for dealing with 'wicked' policy problems.
4. To be able to explain in your own words what the functions of models are
5. To be able to explain in your own words that a model-based assessment does not only comprise objective, value-free scientific facts.
6. To be able to explain in your own words what the characteristics are of scientific and political rationality.
7. To be able to explain in your own words how the interaction between science and politics takes shape in policy making on wicked issues.
8. To be able to explain in your own words which types of uncertainty are key to wicked issues and how they are/can be addressed in the construction and use of models.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35229&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

The case, a real life societal design issue, will be acquired as an (common) assignment for the course from sectorial organizations in the domain of infrastructures, mobility and environment.

The students will work autonomously in teams composed by different disciplinary backgrounds. The design issue, objectives and the infrastructural intervention like a bridge, tunnel or other civil structure as part of a larger system are of central attention including its technological, environmental and societal context,.
Students will investigate the environmental and societal context for its possibilities, constraints and conditions which will be translated into specifications and criteria for a multiple-scale infrastructural intervention by a series of (infra-)structures. This next to the technological specifications and criteria for the (infra-)structures itself. The actual design will be considered and evaluated against the specifications, criteria, its possible environmental and societal impact and also evaluated to which extend the design could add value for society, economy and environment.

The infrastructural intervention spans from: the design of several artefacts/civil structures like bridges, tunnels, dikes etc. characterized by its function, form, construction, materials and its architectural expression; its integration within the transport system like a road and/or traverse: and ultimately its integration within the landscape and/or city. Also aspects like societal support, future use, durability and its environmental/ecological footprint will be considered within the design process.

The final design and report will be assessed with respect to the way the teams of students were able to deal with the design issue, topics and aspects related to different scales and contexts and the way they have translated objectives, specifications and criteria into an innovative and integrated infrastructure design with added value. This as a result of a collaborative and multidisciplinary design process. The team process and final presentation are also part of the assessmant.
The teams will be also asked to reflect on their final design on basis of the theoretic notions from former courses and on the main question from the introductory course 'what is integrated design and how to realize this'.","At the end of the course a student:

"BK7933","Idiosyncratic Infrastructures","In addition to 'integrated design' striving for a synthesis benefitting from a dialogue between disciplines, the course practises an integrated analytical approach, using the particular disciplinary backgrounds of the students.
The design of infrastructures and its component parts is dominated by standards, codes and conventions that are intended to enhance efficiency, safety and feasibility, cemented in a repository of proven knowledge that is above all normative. Idiosyncratic solutions have however often remained off-the-radar, and do not prominently contribute to the body of knowledge of infrastructure design.
The course intends to remedy this knowledge gap, by collecting, redrawing and categorizing pieces of infrastructures. Analysing the specific circumstances conditioning these artefacts, investigating modes of representation specific to infrastructure, and focusing on the very 'thingness' of the infrastructural artefact, eventually results in a catalogue of 'idiosyncratic infrastructures'.
The course which exists out of a series of seminars will be finalized by a presentation and a portfolio of drawings documenting one infrastructural artefact.","At the end of the course a student:
1. has a basic knowledge of key modes of representation of infrastructure in art, design, and engineering and can reflect on these in discussions, drawings and writings;
2. can 'reverse-engineer' by means of drawing particular infrastructural artefacts;

"BK7930","Environment & Infrastructures: Urban Systems","The course aims to train students in analyzing and judging urban infrastructures as crucial elements of complex urban systems. With a focus on one specific zone of an urban infrastructure, we will learn which role this infrastructural zone plays in relation with different urban systems and how the zone contributes to the spatial coherence and quality of the city. The course will contain a site-visit, lectures on different urban systems and workshops to analyse the zone in relation with different urban systems.

Content
The course is an exercise in analysis,understanding and judging urban infrastructures as combinations of urban systems. These infrastructures play a role as part of large scale traffic systems, as well as part of flood defense systems, as part of public space systems, and they influence the system of zoning and distribution of urban programs. Design-interventions in these infrastructures should pay attention to all different roles of these infrastructures.
The course will especially focus on infrastructure zones in a city, which underwent transformations recently, and which have to adapt to a changing context in the future. The students will learn to analyze how these transformations influenced the different systems and in what sense the transformation resulted in a different relation of the systems to each other.","At the conclusion of this course the student has:
- Ability to understand different urban systems;
- Ability to understand the way how different urban systems are related to each other and influence each other;
- ability to analyze and understand urban infrastructures as complex combinations of urban systems
- ability to indicate ways of improvements of urban infrastructures as combinations of urban systems
- ability to indicate the spatial quality of urban infrastructures as part of the spatial composition of the city","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35315&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"SPM6102","Process management and decisionmaking","Projects are generally managed with a strong focus on predicting the schedule, budget, scope resources and tasks. That phase of predicting is then followed by a strong focus on controlling the works towards the predicted outcome (predict and control).
However, many projects have to deal with significant uncertainties, leading to surprises in the execution of the project. Process management offers a different view on projects, focussed on dealing with surprises by preparing for them and committing parties to the project (prepare and commit). It can help steer the project from separated task orientation to an integrated goal orientation.
The course introduces the students to the way in which process management can be used in projects and how that translates to contracts, structures and day-to-day management.

This course is part of the minor project management. (Please contact the module manager in case you would like to follow this course outside the minor program.","Understand how complexity and uncertainties reveal themselves in projects and how to be prepared for them.

"WB3501","Fit-for-purpose Project Management","More and more a contingency approach in project management is advocated in literature: rather than just applying basic project management theory for all projects (regardless specific project characteristics), project management should be tailored to suit a particular project.

This course will focus on this fit-for-purpose project management. Principles of project management taught in this minor will be treated using cases from project management practice in various industries and public environments.

The lectures are taught by staff that have a combined experience from industry and academia as well as by guest lecturers. In this course several open-ended cases will be treated, for which student teams will have to find specific solutions.

Apart from the size and the shape of the project, each project manager has a number of specific preferences for managing his project. The presenters will show what 'fit-for-purpose' means to them in their specific project based on their own 10 do's and don'ts for project management. Preferably the presenters will deliver best practices per phase, per company or per project type and it is up to the students to make their own balanced selection. The students will gather over the various lectures a set of best practices and by comparing and challenging the presenters will come up with a fit-for-purpose approach for their own project (same project as in the integration course, course 3, different assignment). In this way they deliver a set of minimum standards for future reference and are able to challenge future presenters on their experience.
Site visits are part of this course.","The student

In this course, students acquire a fundamental basis for one- and two-phase flow in porous media. This course is an essential basis for all tracks within the MSc Applied Earth Sciences as well as the MSc track Geo-engineering in the MSc Civil Engineering. This course is highly recommended for students interested in Hydraulic Engineering as well as Hydro-geology and Water Management.

The main goal of this course is to give the students a thorough introduction to groundwater flow and solute transport in the sub-surface. The topic is covered from a multi-disciplinary perspective integrating fields as earth science, fluid mechanics, mathematics, and chemistry. After the course the students will understand the origins of the groundwater flow and solute transport equations, both for single phase and multi-phase conditions including air. The students will be able to give qualitative and quantitative solutions to a range of problems. The problems will come from several different application fields.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36160&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

Porosity, permeability, capillarity, parameter determination of rock, principles of acoustic, electric, electro-magnetic and nuclear measurements in boreholes, identification of water, hydrocarbons and coal, quantification of reservoir properties.

Alternation of lectures,exercises and practicals.

lectures and exercises:
- Introduction to the identification, measurement and use of physical rock parameters. Rock mineral content and rock textures, of mainly sedimentary rocks, are related to properties like density, conductivity, magnetics, (natural) radiation, acoustics, compressibility.
- In relation to the definition of synthetic mineral content, the porosity, permeability and capillarity are discussed and calculated during the practicals.
- Finally, Physical, chemical and mechanical concepts to define rock content, rock behaviour and the related accuracy of measuring methods, have to be understood. At the end of the lectures and practicals, often used digital log data and interpretation tools are explained and lithologies are interpreted.

The practical work consist of four ways to measure permeability and porosity:
1. Laboratory measurement: Darcy-flow and porosity.
Experiments at the Laboratory of Technology. This work includes measurements on solid and porous cores. Measured are: Bulk volume and bulk weight and the related matrix volume and matrix density; Calculation of the porosity on the two porous samples, with a dry method and the wet/dry method; Calculation of the gas-permeability of the two porous samples; Estimation of the measurement errors and calculation of the accuracy of the measurements.
2. Empirical relations.
Quantification of grain sizes and grain-size distributions, by using rock surfaces and images.
In this exercise the students get familiar with the concept of empirical relations. How are grain-size distribution, porosity, permeability and capillarity connected to each other. This practical is preferably done after you performed the first assignment.
3. Carman-Kozeny permeability.
Based on spatial distributions of a porous rock texture, measure and calculate the permeability.
4. Combined acoustic and rock mechanical measurements. Different types of acoustic waves are used to measure travel time through whole and a fractured rock specimen.","The student is trained on the essentials in the interpretation of rock type/mineralogy, related rock physics and rock textures. This to define its mineral/fluid composition and geological/mechanical properties. The student learns how to measure and interpret rock characteristics. Finally they learn to do a standard log evaluation on clastic sediments.

"ME1412","Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation","This 'hands on' course teaches the use of particle based simulations using Discrete Element Method (DEM). DEM can be applied to any system that handles or consists out of (groups of) particles. DEM models individual particles (microscopic level) with the aim to model realistic behaviour of a the system of particles (macroscopic level).

DEM can be used as an engineering tool to provide insight in influencing factors (e.g. particle size, shape and density) in particle processes, such as segregation and mixing. It can help to analyse and solve bottlenecks in industrial systems, but then validation of the model is required. After validation DEM can be used as a virtual prototyping environment for design of equipment that handles particulate materials. The application range is wide: from powder handling (small particle sizes, cohesive materials in food or pharmaceutical industry) to large scale systems such as rock dumping (e.g. 300 kg stones, 500 mm in size), and anything in between including bulk handling.

Next to the theoretical background of DEM, the major part of this 'hands on' course is to perform an assignment using the software EDEM. In this assignment you will model and redesign or optimise a (part of a) handling system with a given particulate material. This also requires laboratory work to measure real material properties on a macroscopic level such as angle of repose and wall friction angle. Your DEM model has to represent realistic material behaviour and realistic interaction between material and equipment. With the properly working DEM model you will analyse influential parameters and where possible improve performance of equipment.

Typical application areas for DEM modelling are:
 bulk handling of materials coal and iron ore, also including solid biomass such as wood pellets or biocoal
 mining
 food industry, han dling of powders
 pharmaceutical industry, powders and tablets
 agricultural industry, for planting and soil preparation
 pavement engineering, creating mixtures
 and more.","During the course the student will learn to:
1. define the performance criteria of the system to be modeled
2. choose and implement a simplified but appropriate representation of the system in the simulation environment

5. use DEM simulation software to create a model that is fit for purpose
6. analyse datasets obtained from simulations and experiments

"CME2000","Master Thesis","The Graduation Work consists of a graduation project, a thesis report, a summary of the report and a final presentation.

The Master's Thesis Project takes place at the end of the second year and covers a period of approximately half a year. Students have to carry out an individual project to round off the CME programme. The subject for the research project may be chosen in respect to, or independent from, a specific area of technology and possible elective profile, though students are stimulated to find some connectivity in their choices.

Within this project, students must demonstrate their capacity for academic analysis, synthesis, design, reflection and written communication on a particular issue in the field of engineering and policy analysis.

The student can start the Master's Thesis Project after at least two members of the thesis committee have approved the (draft) project proposal and the student has filled out the application form (MSc CME). This form can be obtained from the Secretary's Office (CiTG room 3.40).

The student starts with an orientation phase that will lead to a detailed Master Thesis Project Proposal. After 3 and before 5 weeks orientation the student presents during a kick-off meeting this Thesis Project Proposal to execute the CME Master thesis project. The Master Thesis Project Proposal should give information on the goal of the project, the main research/design question, a set of derived sub questions/goals that give meaning to the project, data to use/collect, methods planned to be used, and a detailed project planning. After a successful kick-off meeting the student may start with the actual execution of the Thesis Project.

During the project the student will work towards the results of the thesis project and a compilation of project documents that the student will use to write a thesis report. The thesis committee or the student may organize two mid-term meetings to guide the progress of the project.

When the project is almost finished a green-light meeting is held [green light meeting]. During this meeting the student can get a green light to organize his or her final thesis project defense. This means a formal approval from the administration for graduation office (100% of the courses completed) and approval with respect to the contents of the work (compilation of project documents in where research questions are addressed, and a rough version of thesis report). The work should at least be sufficient to pass without any adjustment, but of course expected improvements on both thesis project results and thesis document, suggested by the thesis committee should be considered to be incorporated.

The student finalizes the thesis project in respect to the agreements made during the green light meeting. During the [final defense meeting] the student gives a final presentation to defend the final project results. If all results, including the defense and presentation, are sufficient the diploma and final grade for the thesis project as a whole will be handed out. Students are required to make the thesis report available in both hard- and soft copy.

More detailed and essential information about the Master's Thesis Project can be found in 'Guideline Graduation Thesis' (available at room 3.40). This guideline can be obtained from the CME Secretary's Office or downloaded from the CME Website.","The master thesis objectives are :

"TIL4030-14","Interdisciplinary Fundamentals","In this course we will introduce and overview a large part of the TIL field. The course consists of three parts:

Part 1 (3EC) starts in Q1 gives you a number of skills, tools and insights that you can use throughout the curriculum:
(a) In the first week we will bring you up to speed (or at least motivate you) with some generic skills we expect from any TU Delft Msc student: scientific thinking and reasoning; asking valid (research) questions and problem solving / programming.
(b) a set of reference models, viewpoints, concepts and ideas with which you can analyse TIL systems: you get a taste of the four specializations of the TIL curriculum: P (policy), D (design), E (engineering) and O (operations). You'll see that in reality (that is, in large TIL projects), there is no P without D, E without O, or any other combination you can think of. You cannot design transport networks without considering operations (e.g. management), or the policy context, or the consequences for logistic chains. Transport, by its very nature is a multi- and in many cases an interdisciplinary field.

Part 3 (3EC) focuses on two things. With the Delft Systems Approach you will learn how to decompose and model a complex system into components and dynamic processes. Although DSS focuses on modeling of (closed) industrial systems, the underlying concepts are generic and applicable to any open or closed transport system. The second component of part 3 focuses on system design tools particularly for open TIL systems.

Part 2 (3EC) is a 'mini' interdisciplinary project, in which you work in a mixed team of fellow student on a TIL topic of your own choice. 1 EC you do in Q1, and the remaining 2EC in Q2. You are expected to utilize some of the tools you are offered in Parts 1 and 3, but most of all to use your creativity, and to demonstrate scientific rigor in your reasoning and your assumptions.","(a) The student has knowledge/insight in the different disciplines active within the TIL domain, i.e. the student
... has knowledge/insight about the terminologies used in these different disciplines (i.e. recall them and explain what they mean)
... has knowledge about the interactions between disciplines

(b) The student has knowledge/insight about different reference models used in these disciplines (i.e. recall them and list their properties/characteristics)

(c) The student must be able to apply these reference models on a particular TIL problem / system; e.g. to break down a TIL system in a transport and traffic market (TRAIL model) or to decompose an (industrial) transport system into processes and components (Delft Systems Aproach)

(d) The student is able to use these reference models and their outcomes
... to evaluate TIL systems;
... to synthesize the outcomes of such evaluations and
... to design solutions that resolve the synthesized problems or that serve the synthesized requirements

"CME5000","Procurement of Large Infrastructural Projects","Purchasing motives and strategies
It seems like purchasing is an obligatory aspect of public parties. Therefore tenders are often written by governmental entities. They all look the same but in essence they differ a lot. There are several strategies when and how to approach the market in search for a fitting proposal for a tender. A different approach to the market will result in many different types of proposal in return.

Thinking differently
This course is an introduction for engineering students to the basic principles of the Information Measurement Theory (IMT) and the 'personality typologies' as found in Kashiwagi Solution Model (KSM). This sets in motion a paradigm shift from a price-based market towards a value-based market as seen increasingly important in the construction industry. In the relation between two parties in the supply changing this means that responsibility is transferred from the client to the vendor.

Transparency and performance metrics
The counterpart of the procurement-officer is the sales-manager. Sales managers are allegedly highly skilled in 'sales pitches'. Generic quotes like: 'We are the biggest' or 'We are the most diverse' are used to underline why a certain company can fulfill a customers requirement. Often ending in conflicts while a mismatch in expectations existed. By csreating a transparent environment and therefore showing performance metrics there is no question about the integrity of the 'sales-pitch'.

Procurement method: EMAT (EMVI) tendering
Supposedly EMAT can be a solution for problems occurring in the construction industry. Hence by combining complex projects in integrated contracts,
Economically Most Advantageous Tender (EMAT) award mechanisms are called for. This increases the chance for bids with a better value price ratio. EMAT tendering procedures are seen in a variety of procurement strategies and can have a severe impact on the time spend by the vendor preparing his plan.

Procurement method: Best Value Procurement (BVP)
Since the introduction of Best Value as an award mechanism in the Netherlands in 2006, it is gaining ground rapidly. After the US, Best Value Procurement (BVP) is most applied in the Netherlands. Besides the construction industry, it is being applied in more and more supply chains such as shipbuilding, IT, health care etc. Since 2010 BVP is on it's way becoming the new way of procurement within the Netherlands.

From procurement to execution of a project
Working together as effective as possible requires a certain mindset of both parties. We often see that during executions problems in the collaboration occur. Mainly these occur around unplanned events and arise from inexplicit role descriptions between two parties.","After completing the course students:

 Will be able to distinguish procurement strategies for complex infrastructural projects,
 Understand value-based thinking,
 See the importance of establishing a transparent environment between contractor and principle,
 Can distinguish the main challenges faced during execution of a project.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=37613&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"CME2210","Open Design & Construction Management","This elective course is about a managerial approach for complex construction projects focussed at quality in the sense of fitness for purpose, rather than on compliance with specifications, rules and regulations. Since this stakeholder-oriented project management brings along openness and transparency, it is labelled Open Design.","The course comprises four main topics:

1. The stakeholder-oriented mindset;
2. Quality as fitness for purpose;
3. Probabilistic network planning with allowance for mitigations-on-the-run, including associated supporting software;
4. Multi-criteria decision-making, including associated supporting software.

The tools and concepts offered are complementary to the traditional ones as recommended in the mainstream of project management literature.

Students are requested to apply the offered tools and concepts in a real-life construction project of their own choice. Foreign students are free to select a project from their home country. The report should cover the four topics mentioned before as well as material from the lectures where appropriate. Students are free to work alone or as a duo.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36076&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"SPM8002","Process Management","Complex construction and engineering projects require collaboration between a variety of actors within a complex and dynamic environment. An environment that is influenced by various social, political and physical factors. These actors may be related to a project in various ways, e.g. as decision makers, regulators, risk taking participants and stakeholders, each with different interests, resources and attitudes towards a project, being affected by a project and influencing it in different ways and degrees. In order to understand and adequately deal with these characteristics, process management is needed in addition to project management. Building on practical experiences and process management theory, this course aims at providing students with insights, concepts and skills needed to understand the nature of interaction between actors regarding the initiation and development of, and decision making on projects within uncertain and dynamic situations. They will learn to analyse, develop and apply strategies, tools and arrangements that are part of the process management approach, to understand the differences with line and project management and to recognize the conditions for applying process management.","Students should be able to:
 Identify and analyse the perceptions, interests, strategies and institutional conditions that shape and constrain the behaviour of central government, local authorities, financiers, competitors, suppliers, interests groups, users, experts and mass media.
 Think strategically, understand the dynamics of multi-actor interaction processes in uncertain and highly politicized contexts and cope with technological and strategic uncertainties and risks including the behaviour of actors and to show this in description or application.
 Develop knowledge, skills and competences on how to manage divergent and conflicting interests of different actors including principles of integrative negotiation and to apply this in practice.
 Acquire knowledge, skills and competences with regard to arrangements and tools which support collaboration and process management, including process design, actor- and stakeholder analysis, SWOT-analyses, and the use of expert-knowledge and research and to apply it in practice.
 Reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of process management strategies and the conditions for applying process management.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35268&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"CME2200","Dynamic Control of Projects","Each project is an intervention in an existing situation. The aim is to incorporate a system into an existing environment. A project is a specific and unique development, for a unique client, on a unique location, with a unique goal, to solve a unique problem, with a unique problem solver, etc. A project needs time for the development with a number of subsequent phases: design, engineering, production, etc.

In most cases:
(1) the state of the environment at the start of a project is totally different from the state of the environment during the project, at the end of the project and certainly during the operation phase during the lifetime of the system,
(2) the information and knowledge about the desired system in its environment increases dramatically during the project, which leads to different views and options and
(3) the state of the technology to be applied in a project changes during a project.
In consequence, we developed systems with the ideas of yesterday and with today's technology for tomorrow's people.

The only way to develop systems which are: (1) fit for purpose,(2) up to date and (3) provided with state of the art technology is that we work dynamically, not only: (1) with the ideas of today, (2) with today's technology and (3) for today's people, but at the same time: (1) with the ideas of tomorrow, (2) with the technology of tomorrow, (3) for the people of tomorrow.

This means that we should not only work dynamically in an adaptive way with continuous change, but also that the systems we deliver are also adaptable to changing circumstances. Inevitably, the traditional project management should realize that the construction world will also be a part of the new short-cyclic and circular economy. We need a dynamic control approach.","After this course you have:
- insight in the dynamic character of a project, a product and a process,
- insight in methods to develop complex systems which should be installed in other complex systems at higher scale,
- insight in methods to control the effectiveness and efficiency of projects in a fast changing world,
- insight in contractual matters including procurement, which play a role in project control.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36070&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"SPM8000","Project Management","This course focuses on the project management of construction projects. Projects, in all contemporary industry sectors and specifically in construction, are becoming increasingly complex and challenging with the accelerated advances in technology, new business models, forms of collaboration, availability requirements, and an augmented demand to deliver economic value and a competitive advantage. Managing projects in this environment requires strong leadership skills and proficiency in project management knowledge and practice to be able to achieve the project and organizational objectives on time, on budget and to the satisfaction of stakeholders.
The course is designed to provide students with scholarly knowledge in the practice of managing construction projects in order to enhance their career options and prepare them to move into management roles by developing their professionalism, versatility and leadership in an environment of constant change.

"SPM5610","Planning and Design of Multi-Modal Infrastructure Networks","The policy cycle is in this integration course roughly the guideline in planning and designing transport infrastructure. The various phases in the cycle deal with concepts, approaches, methods etc., being used in structuring and supporting design and decision-making with regard to infrastructure. During the entire course attention is paid to a 'running case': possibilities for a sustainable development of the main transport infrastructure in (part of) the European Union: the Trans-European Transport Networks 'new style'. Especially large-scale infrastructure is involved, for which above all up to date and very extensive projects such as the construction of high-speed railway lines, tunnels below the Alps, expansion of large airports like London Heathrow or Amsterdam Schiphol, or simply the joining of new member states, play an important role.
Without exception, here it concerns complex physical planning problems with design aspects of (inter)national nodes, connections and networks. Moreover, the projects mentioned are mostly at odds with the environmental management and often we have also to deal with competitive claims as to space. This integration course aims at contributing to the development of an integrated infrastructure policy regarding the policy fields traffic and transport, physical planning, regional economy and environment in the form of an interdisciplinary policy advice. The course aims at achieving a synergy between substantive technical knowledge and policy making knowledge.

"SPM9446","System Reliability in Quantitative Risk Assessment","This course presents the basic concepts of reliability analysis of complex systems, one of the corner stones of risk assessment and management of technological systems. It starts with a description of the fundamental procedural steps of a quantified risk assessment and identification of the scientific disciplines and available methodological tools to complete each step.

A system (scenario-based) approach is employed, where the source of risk is considered as a system with constituent components or elements. Risk is then defined and determined as a set of triplets {si, pi, ci}: si are the scenarios (sequence of events) that lead to the undesired consequences, ci, and pi are the probabilities with which these scenarios are expected to occur.

The course focuses on methodologies and corresponding tools that can provide the scenarios (si) and the corresponding probabilities of occurrence (pi). To this end, the complex system is modeled as a collection of interconnected subsystems or components among which there are functional interdependencies. Methods for modeling the functional interdependencies of the components will be presented both for two-state as well as for multi-state components. These methods model the states of the complex system as collection of states of its components. Next, the principles of probability are employed to assess the probability of the various system states in terms of the probability of the component states.

Fundamental concepts and measures of reliability will be introduced at a components level. Then complex systems (multi-component) will be addressed.

Static or on demand events will be examined. Methods to be studies include block-diagrams, fault-trees, event-trees. Techniques for quantification of these models including dependence analysis will be presented. Importance analysis will be examined providing methods for determining the relative contribution of each component into the proper function of a complex system, as well as, its contribution to the probability of system failure. The use of data (observed behavior of the system and its components) to derive the values of various reliability parameters will be presented.

Throughout the course, practical examples of systems from the chemical, nuclear, electricity generation, water, energy and railway industry, as well as, examples from occupational risk and land use domain will be used to demonstrate the various methods and techniques.","After successfully completing the course, students will be able to:
 identify potential risk problems in complex systems

"EPA1423","Decision making in networks","All organizations, big or small, public or private, national or international, take decisions on a daily basis. One would like to believe that such decisions - taken in and between organizations - are highly structured, well-planned and based on all the necessary information. In reality, information is often incomplete or contested by the multiple actors involved in decision making processes. Whether it is governments pushing through policies or companies trying to increase profits, rarely can a decision be made in isolation from competing interests, both within the organization and outside it. As a result, decisions often appear to be taken in a chaotic and ill-structured manner.

One of the primary purposes of this course is to make students realize that it is often impossible to reach decisions through rational problem solving and information processing. In many instances, carefully pre-conceived plans and hierarchically enforced decisions backfire. Even ministers or CEOs often cannot decide unilaterally but have to negotiate and make compromises. Decision making is characterized by permanent struggle and the exercise of both formal and informal power. In such situations, with many different actors that have a variety of interests yet are dependent on each other, rational problem solving is not only unattainable but also undesirable.

This course first of all introduces students to theoretical perspectives and models that help to describe how decisions are made in practice, i.e. what decision-makers really do, and explain why decisions are made in such a way, i.e. why decision makers actually do what they do. Beyond description and explanation, this course then acquaints students with how networks are structured and what strategies may be used in managing a variety of actors and interests. During the lectures students apply the theoretical perspectives and models to real-life examples of decision making. In parallel students analyze a case study in more depth, which evaluates past decision making processes to formulate recommendations to actors about future decision making processes. At the end of the course students are not only able to analyze decision making processes in networks, but are also able to design (strategies for) decision making processes that enable change in a multi-actor context.","At the end of this course students will be able to:
- Understand and apply rational and political perspectives on decision making.
- Contrast the characteristics of networks with the characteristics of hierarchies, and recognize these in real life cases.
- Independently reconstruct and evaluate decision-making processes about complex problems in multi-actor settings, i.e. in networks and organizations.
- Recognize and design strategies for decision-making processes in networks and organizations.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35136&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

These technologies are being used in the production of various water qualities, such as drinking water, industrial process water, and effluents for a range of purposes. Especially the treatment of used water enables the recovery of resources such as minerals, fertilizers, and energy. The following fundamental processes will be discussed:

 Water quality
 Mass transfer
 Filtration
 Adsorption
 Ion exchange
 Sedimentation
 Chemical reactions
 Biochemical reactions

Further, to illustrate the above processes, a selection of treatment processes will be discussed in more detail. These include:

 Aeration
 Filtration
 Biochemical conversion
 Reactors and modelling

Practicals:
Various basic experiments will be carried out to become familiar with fundamental processes for water treatment, including: stripping, filtration. Moreover, the most important measuring techniques will be taught, including dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen species, electrical conductivity, pH, alkalinity. All experiments and measurements will be graded based on individual proficiency.","Course goal:
Students will understand fundamental chemical, physical and biological processes in the treatment of water, and their role in water treatment processes. With this understanding students will be able to make calculations, on the basis of these processes, for the purpose of design and research. After the practical students will have acquired basic lab skills, and will be able to link experimental observations with fundamental processes.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36556&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"CIE5307","Coastal Zone Management","The course responds to a number of higher level goals beyond the course itself, but to which the course contributes. These are associated with the introduction and implementation of ICZM and include, for example, the expressed need to examine key issues of decision making on urban and recreational development in vulnerable coastal section and integration of sectoral activities in coastal development. It also takes into account the policy objectives of sound Coastal Zone Policy, which emphasise local participation in decision making.

In sum, the course is part of a learning process which, by means of a structured programme, undertakes the formation of trained manpower capable of redressing identified problems and helping to build capable institutions, better able to manage and guide the development of the coastal zone.

The course consists of lectures, demonstrations and workshops. The guiding line through the whole course is the idea that a coastal zone should be regarded as an integrated system. This will be illustrated by using several case studies in several countries. One of these cases (the fictive estuary of 'Pesisir Tropicana') will be worked out in a workshop. In the case studies the coastal zone is regarded as a coastal land/water body in the sense that there are demands for various products and services that the Bay and its environs can supply -- that is, it is a multiple-use resource. The regional economy of the area used in the exercise is similar to those in many coastal areas in the world, particularly in developing countries. There is a large urban complex, port facilities and industrial base, with a well developed service sector. Fishing is carried out in the coastal waters. In the hinterland, various types of primary production take place, including agriculture and mining. Wage levels, existing pollution control and production technologies are typical of many developing countries. Special attention will be given to the Worldbank Guidelines for CZM plans.
Attention is paid to various aspects relevant for the planning of the coastal zone: Natural system (biotic and abiotic); user functions with socio-economic relations; System analysis and policy analysis.
Application in a practical setting (case study) with simulation game.","The objectives of the course are to:
Develop an appreciation for and know-how of conceptualisation, policy design, methodology, tools and techniques for coastal zone management
Gain an understanding and operational grasp of the interdependence of managerial functions related to the improvement of coastal planning and management
Appreciate the need for integration of coastal zone development policies and their implementation
Become familiar with the multi-disciplinary aspects of the CZM-approach and acquire the capabilities for guiding and supporting multi-disciplinary teams in complex situations","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36537&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

For the modeling exercise, the class will be divided in several groups of 5 to 6 persons. Each group will model a set of integrated water resources management issues and simulate possible development scenario's. Two of the problem sets are:
1. Heating up of the Rhine due to climate change;
2. The effects of small reservoirs for irrigation in the Volta basin.
In addition, there is room for different cases, to be discussed during the first lecture.
The simulation exercise and the reporting should incorporate the concerns of the groups that are mostly affected by the issue and the groups that can contribute most to its resolution.

"CIE3410-09","Water Control","Central topic of the course is analysis and design of natural and man-made water systems (canals, rivers, agricultural fields, polders, irrigation systems, soils, aquifers) based on hydraulic and hydrological knowledge. Common flow processes encountered in practice are discussed, including open-channel flow, hydraulic structures, soil water flow, and groundwater flow. In particular, the course focuses on:

(1) unified treatment of the physics of water flow in surface and subsurface systems based on the principles of mass and momentum conservation

(2) basic numerical methods for solving the relevant flow equations

(3) application of theory to existing systems from around the world.

As such, the course consolidates and builds on prior knowledge obtained in other courses, and prepares for more advanced topics in the MSc Watermanagement program.","The overall goal is to analyze and quantify water flow through natural and man-made systems such as canals, rivers, agricultural fields, polders, irrigation systems, soils, and aquifers. This requires the following:

"CIE4431","Hydrological Modelling","Modelling is an essential component of hydrological research. Philosophically speaking, the hydrological model is the codification of our knowledge and understanding of the hydrological reality. The word model has a double meaning. It means our perception of reality: the perceptual model; and it means the mathematical description of this perceptual model: the mathematical model.
As engineers, we tend to think of a hydrological model as a piece of software, but it is essential to remain aware that a perceptual model is always underlying the mathematical model and that this perceptual model is the most important. It is not the outside appearance of a model that characterizes it; it is the internal structure, architecture and conceptualization. Just like a person's soul, nature and character is more important than his or her appearance.
In this course we are mostly addressing the soul, nature and character of hydrological models and we shall distinguish different model types (conceptual, physical, or data-driven), different model architectures (distributed, lumped), and different scales and processes (plot-scale to river basin scale, groundwater, soil, river routing, etc.).
The course is partly theoretical and partly practical. In workshops students will receive hands-on training in the development and use of different hydrological models. An important component of the course is the individual assignment that students have to complete in one of the selected fields of modelling. The oral exam is largely based on the individual assignment but will also examine the entire lecture material as described in this lecture note and the related reference material that is presented on Blackboard.
The course consists of the following lectures, given on 7 days:
1. Introduction.
2. Conceptual modelling.
3. Distributed models.
4. Physically based modelling.
5. Data-driven modelling.
6. Groundwater modelling.
7. Calibration and uncertainty.
8. Scaling and reduction of parameters.
9. Remarks on floating point numbers and programming style.","The first objective is to introduce hydrological modelling. Topics discussed relate to the selected conceptual model, model structure, mathematical description, model calibration and validation, boundary conditions, spatial and temporal discretisations, model parameterisation, etc. The second objective is to present fundamental modelling issues that commonly relate to model uncertainty and the fundamental relation between 'model complexity' and 'model performance'. The overall objective is to be able to build computer models that are reliable and trustworthy, and to be able to critically evaluate and analyse model results.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36530&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"CIE4400","Water Quality Modelling","Water Quality Modeling (CT4400) deals with mathematical modeling of water quality processes in surface waters: rivers, lakes, and estuaries. The modeling of water quality processes relies heavily on physically-based hydrodynamic processes (advection, dispersion, diffusion), therefore deterministic mathematical models are applied, with special attention to analytical solutions. To investigate the fate and transport of constituents, often semi-empirical approaches are needed. The course is composed of the following topics:

1. Processes: Advection, diffusion, dispersion and water quality; understanding of the principles. Lectures and self study.

2. Lakes: Understanding how to make a mass balance of dissolved substances. Stratification and temperature modeling and the link to the aquatic ecosystem. Small exercises.

3. Rivers: Understanding, working with and building (numerical implementation) of your own water quality model. Lectures, computer exercises (Excel and Matlab) and self study

4. Estuaries: Salinity intrusion modeling in estuaries, making use of analytical solutions that can be directly linked to ecological relationships. Lectures, computer exercises and self study.

"CIE4410","Water Systems, People and Society","The course will discuss the various ways that humans and human society have manipulated natural water systems to make them fit several different objectives, as new functions for these water management systems were created.

Although the main examples will come from irrigation systems, the course will deal with many different types of water systems. Analysing these systems will link requirements in terms of technical engineering constraints, management possibilities and water users (wishes and options). This may include the design and operation of regulation structures, dams, reservoirs, weirs and conveyance systems; balancing water supply and water requirements in time and space is a main focus of analysis too.

In addition, the way water systems connect individuals and social groups on short and long term will be studied. Daily actions of individual users may hamper future cooperation and as such will influence societal development on the long term. However, water systems typically require cooperation - sustained long use of water systems can only be understood when studying how cooperation works.

How to model these interactions between water systems and people on different temporal and spatial scales will be a main methodological issue.","The course has two main goals:
1. Improving understanding of water systems as anthropogenic landscapes emerging from activities of individuals, households, and small groups within a given material context.
2. Developing understanding of human agency linked to the water systems' hydraulic and hydrological properties, to appropriately link material contexts and human actions.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=36535&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"OE4626","Dredging Processes","The course focuses on 3 main dredging processes:
The cutting of sand, clay and rock;
These are explained in detail.
Exercises allow participants to apply the knowledge gained in practical situations.

In dredging, trenching, (deep sea) mining, drilling, tunnel boring and many other applications, sand, clay or rock has to be excavated. The productions (and thus the dimensions) of the excavating equipment range from mm3/sec - cm3/sec to m3/sec. In oil drilling layers with a thickness of a magnitude of 0.2 mm are cut, while in dredging this can be of a magnitude of 0.1 m with cutter suction dredges and meters for clamshells and backhoe's. Some equipment is designed for dry soil, while others operate under water saturated conditions. Installed cutting powers may range up to 10 MW. For both the design, the operation and production estimation of the excavating equipment it is important to be able to predict the cutting forces and powers.
The book gives an overview of cutting theories. It starts with a generic model, which is valid for all types of soil (sand, clay and rock) after which the specifics of dry sand, water saturated sand, clay, rock and hyperbaric rock are covered. For each soil type small blade angles and large blade angles, resulting in a wedge in front of the blade, are discussed. The failure mechanism of sand, dry and water saturated, is the so called Shear Type. The failure mechanism of clay is the so called Flow Type, but under certain circumstances also the Curling Type and the Tear Type are possible. Rock will usually fail in a brittle way. This can be brittle tensile failure, the Tear Type, for small blade angles, but it can also be brittle shear failure, which is of the Shear Type of failure mechanism for larger blade angles. Under hyperbaric conditions rock may also fail in a more ductile way according to the Flow Type of failure mechanism.
For each case considered, the equations/model for the cutting forces, power and specific energy are given. The models are verified with laboratory research, mainly at the Delft University of Technology, but also with data from literature.","Understand and reproduce the Mohr circle;

"CIE4325","Ocean Waves","This course addresses the observation, analysis and prediction of wind-generated waves in the open ocean and coastal waters. The lectures start with the observation techniques, before continuing with the question of how to describe these seemingly random motions of the sea, which we call waves. Two techniques are introduced: a statistical description and a spectral technique. This, in its turn, is followed by the linear theory of surface gravity waves (as they are formally called). This theory gives the interrelation between physical characteristics as the surface motion, the wave-induced pressure in the water and the motion of water particles. It beautifully supplements the concept of the spectrum. Initially, the lectures treat only open-water aspects of the linear theory, in other words, deep-water conditions without currents or a coast. This provides, together with the spectral description of the waves, the introduction to the energy balance of waves in oceanic waters. Sources and sinks are added to this balance, to represent the generation (by wind), the interactions amongst the waves themselves (wave-wave interactions) and the dissipation of the waves (by white-capping). The second part of the course focuses on wave transformation in coastal waters, and therefore on the effects of sea bottom topography and currents (shoaling, refraction, diffraction, reflection, surf breaking).","At the end of this course, you should be able to:
 Describe the different observation techniques of wind-generated waves and their limitations;
 Explain the rationale behind the definition and computation of the wave spectrum and calculate spectral wave characteristics;
 Characterize wind-generated waves in a statistical framework;
 Explain the physical processes driving wave transformation in oceanic and coastal waters and evaluate which processes dominate in a given situation;

The course is divided into three phases: phase 1: inception plan; phase 2: preliminary design and studies; phase 3: process evaluation with respect to interdisciplinary aspects; final report.

Description

Phase 1: preliminary investigation (Problem exploration and treatment). By means of supplied and found information (project file, informers, literature) an inventory and analysis of the problem must be made. This results in a (substantive) problem formulation and an objective. Coupled to that, a treatment will be formulated. Which methods will be used, which contribution can different disciplines provide to the project, which steps have been passed through successively, which information is still necessary, where can that information be found? Finally the organization of the group must be fixed.

Phase 2: design. At this stage is alternatively worked for the complete problem and for sub-problems. The work exists for a part of research, for a another part of developing design alternatives or solution alternatives, and from developing the sub-problems. Ongoing, the consistency with the whole design must be monitored.

Phase 3: Round-off. In the round-off, the last hand is laid to the results of the project. First of all the handed in report is discussed with the speculator team, whereupon the definite version is made. The participants evaluate the project, both substantive and concerning the project process. Finally, the presentation is prepared and a summary for the presentation is established.

"CIE4510","Climate Change: Science & Ethics","Climate change is one of the most profound and complex issues affecting our society and economy today. Many scientists argue that there are too many variable factors to effectively see the big picture, while other scientists who believe human activity is to blame for global warming are ready to outline specific actions to prevent more damage. Skeptics believe that climate change is part of the natural global progression and that human activity will neither worsen nor improve our situation.

Those who are in favor of a global effort to reverse climate change believe that current climate models are underestimating the magnitude of future warming and argue that the uncertainty surrounding this threat is no excuse for inaction. Skeptics in turn argue that scientists who want to attract attention to themselves, who want to attract great funding to themselves, have found a way to scare the public by making things bigger and more dangerous than they really are. Despite continuing uncertainties about the detailed linkages, extreme weather events are increasingly being attributed to human interference, and greater emphasis is emerging on the need to prevent and to adapt to climatic changes.

The course provides an introduction to the basic physics of the climate system, how climate has changed in the past and how climate will change in the future. The focus in on the energy balance of the climate system and how this balance is affected by greenhouse gases and aerosols; the physical processes in the atmosphere and oceans that shape the climate; the response of the oceans, ice sheets and glaciers to global warming; the evidence for past and present climate change; climate models and model uncertainties; climate predictions.

A second focal point of the course is the broader societal and ethical aspects of climate change. In particular, we will focus on past emissions and responsibilities, implications of global warming on human safety and security, the distribution of burdens and benefits, emission rights, international justice and intergenerational justice.

"CIE5340","Soil Dynamics","Soil dynamics is an important discipline within the field of soil mechanics and foundation engineering. Especially in countries with a higher risk of earthquakes, for example Japan and the United States of America, soil dynamics is a vital part of earthquake engineering. Earthquake engineering is the science to design earthquake resistant buildings and infrastructure. In Delta countries like the Netherlands there are not very strong earthquakes, but here soil dynamics is important for other reasons.
Because of the expanding cities and because of the growing number of traffic jams, more underground structures like bored tunnels, underground railway stations and parking garages are build close to the foundations of already existing buildings. Vibrations due to demolishing of old structures, installation of foundation piles and sheet piles, passing trains or other vibrating sources may create structural damage or personal discomfort. Soil dynamical knowledge is needed to explain, predict and solve these problems.","The students are given the background knowledge both to formulate and solve practical problems occurring in soil dynamics and to interpret the calculated results.

"CIE4367","Embankments and Geosynthetics","The course deals with embankments for earthworks, with special focus on dikes and road and railway construction.

Embankments are often built on soft soil. Therefore, deformation, for example settlement and stability, are important items in embankment design. Furthermore, due to soft soil behaviour, the construction of an embankment will have consequences for its surroundings. A special category of embankments is formed by water retaining structures, such as dikes and levees. These types of embankments were constructed in the past, some even in the Middle Ages. To prove that they still meet the design requirements, stability assessment of these old dikes and levees is required.

Main items of the course are:
 Consolidation behaviour and analysis of settlements
 Strength of soil and stability analysis
 Field and Laboratory testing: choice of the parameters

"AES1640-11","Environmental Geotechnics","The course is built around the source-path-object concept in Environmental Risk Management. The rationale behind the course is that the subsurface provides modern day society with a wide range of services, which the environmental community tends to call 'ecosystem services'. These services include, issues such as element cycling (carbon, nitrogen, phosphates), water cycling and filtration, basic foundation for building infra-structure, repository for biodiversity, etc. Civil- and geo-engineers are more and more making use of these 'ecosystem services' in their solutions to engineering problems and therefore they require a thorough understanding of the backgrounds of these services.

"CIE5320","Site Characterisation, Testing and Physical Model","This course deals with the set up and execution of site investigations for civil engineering projects, both onshore and offshore, with an emphasis on geotechnical and geological factors that can be of influence on the realisation of the projects. Attention is paid to standard and advanced techniques to collect geotechnical data (walk along survey, laboratory and in-situ testing, monitoring data) and to the problems that some specific soil and rock types can impose. In the accompanying laboratory practical, a number of important soil and rock tests are carried out. During field excursions, students are exposed to real ground and site investigation.

The course further deals with physical modelling and experimental techniques in soil mechanics in general.

"CIE4365-13","Coupled Processes in Subsurface","Many processes in the subsurface show a complex interaction with each other. An example is consolidation during loading of saturated and unsaturated deformable porous media, like soils. Deformations in such media lead to changes in the pore volume and corresponding changes in pore fluid pressures which initiate seepage and affect the general behaviour. Understanding such coupled processes is of great importance to settlements and stability, in particular when permeability is small, compressibility is large and strength is limited.
Other examples of coupled processes are the Thermo-chemo-hydro-mechanical coupled processes found in situations where flow of water, heat and solutes play an important role such as waste management (both in landfills as well in underground nuclear repositories). A very recent field where coupled processes play a significant role is biology as a driving force for the dynamics in temperature, chemistry, hydrology and mechanics in the so-called Biological Geo and Civil Engineering.

In this course the students develop skills for analyzing coupled processes. They can derive the controlling partial differential equations and implement these equations in Matlab to solve realistic problems. The processes discussed during the course should be familiar as they have already been addressed in different courses. In this course the students are expected to solve realistic problems where these processes are coupled to each other.","The student can recognize the occurrence of coupled processes in the subsurface, develop and implement mechanistic conceptual models how the processes interact.

Various orders of tensors and their associated tensorial operators (like dyadic product, (double) dot product, cross product) are explained in 3 different tensor notation styles: direct, base and index notation. With this knowledge, tensor expressions are judged on their correctness, and simple proofs for tensor equalities are discussed.
The next topic concerns motion and deformation. Deformation will be the basis for the derivation of small and large/ finite strain tensors in the reference and the current configuration. This is followed by the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor and the spectral decomposition into the principal stretches and their corresponding directions.
Furthermore the stress tensor is introduced, including traction and stress components, principal stresses and their directions, and isotropic and deviatoric stress tensors. Material time derivatives of vector and tensor fields are described and their physical significance is clarified.
The core part of the course is related to mechanical balance laws and several basic continuum theories like hyperelasticity, plasticity and viscoelasticity, all setup in a thermodynamic large deformation framework. Several material models based on combinations of the before mentioned theories are discussed, for example the Generalized Maxwell model.
Finally the basic laws of physics for multi-phase materials are formulated. The same physical laws are deployed for each phase of the multi-phase continuum, inclusive of interaction terms. Then constitutive laws for each of the phases and their interactions are discussed. Also, as a special topic , a constitutive framework for materials with strong discontinuities is presented.","1.

"CIE4614","Land surveying and civil infrastructure","Surveying is of key importance for any construction or infrastructural project  in the planning and preparation phase and the construction phase itself, but also afterwards during the actual operation. Applications to be considered are tunnelling (e.g. the Noord-Zuidlijn in Amsterdam, and the Spoorzone in Delft), planning and construction of roads and railways, monitoring and maintaining dikes, construction and monitoring of buildings, bridges and dams.

In this course you will learn how to solve a number of specific surveying problems: which techniques are available and can be used for specific applications in relation with the required accuracy?

The larger part of the course concerns the acquisition and processing of point clouds: massive numbers of measurements in 3D space. Point clouds are acquired from multi-view recordings made by 'ordinary' (b/w or color) cameras, or by range cameras, like the Kinect, and laser ranging instruments. After completing a survey, 3d measurement and object reconstruction can be performed on the basis of the acquired point cloud. Recognition of objects and extraction of other relevant information from point clouds are covered in the course, as well as representation of the results by means of Digital Terrain Models.","After completing the course Land Surveying and Civil Infrastructure students will be able to:

"CIE4613","Climate change: science and ethics","Climate change is one of the most profound and complex issues affecting our society and economy today. Many scientists argue that there are too many variable factors to effectively see the big picture, while other scientists who believe human activity is to blame for global warming are ready to outline specific actions to prevent more damage. Skeptics believe that climate change is part of the natural global progression and that human activity will neither worsen nor improve our situation.

Those who are in favor of a global effort to reverse climate change believe that current climate models are underestimating the magnitude of future warming and argue that the uncertainty surrounding this threat is no excuse for inaction. Skeptics in turn argue that scientists who want to attract attention to themselves, who want to attract great funding to themselves, have found a way to scare the public by making things bigger and more dangerous than they really are. Despite continuing uncertainties about the detailed linkages, extreme weather events are increasingly being attributed to human interference, and greater emphasis is emerging on the need to prevent and to adapt to climatic changes.

The course provides an introduction to the basic physics of the climate system, how climate has changed in the past and how climate will change in the future. The focus in on the energy balance of the climate system and how this balance is affected by greenhouse gases and aerosols; the physical processes in the atmosphere and oceans that shape the climate; the response of the oceans, ice sheets and glaciers to global warming; the evidence for past and present climate change; climate models and model uncertainties; climate predictions.

A second focal point of the course is the broader societal and ethical aspects of climate change. In particular, we will focus on past emissions and responsibilities, implications of global warming on human safety and security, the distribution of burdens and benefits, emission rights, international justice and intergenerational justice.

"CIE4607","Oceans, sea-level and bathymetry","The ocean surface is continuously changing due to processes acting at different spatial and temporal scales. Sea level is affected by sub-daily tides, by multi-yearly changes in ocean circulation (e.g., El Nino), but also by climate change, by long-term geophysical processes and by changes in ocean bathymetry. For instance, global mean sea level is currently rising at a rate of about 3 mm/yr and is expected to accelerate during the coming decades, potentially rising by more than one meter by the end of the century. Monitoring and understanding sea level changes requires a combination of different techniques, in order to capture processes that take place in the open ocean as well as those that affect coastal areas. The course is about he observation techniques used to measure sea level variations including their potential and limitations, the analysis of the data provided by the measurement sensors, and their application to the study of the geophysical processes causing sea level variations.

"IN4400","Programming and data science for the 99%","Programming and data analysis are more important today than ever before and as a student as TU Delft, you are bound to deal with it at one point: in a course, for a project, for your graduation project or when you start your career.

But how do you handle your data? With Excel, with Python, with MatLab? How to quickly build a program that exactly solves your problem? The one library you thought could help does not compile and the code form this paper does not cover your edge case. Help!

In this course (new in 2014/2015) we will cover exactly this. The course can be chosen by all TU Delft MsC students and prepares you for all coding and data tasks during and after your MSc.

At the end of this course, you will be able to understand, visualize and process data better.

How does the course look like?

This course consists of a little bit of algorithmics, a dash of data science and a lot of hands-on experience on problems you care about.

The preliminary syllabus per week looks as follows:

Data analysis with Excel: data tables and range names, lookup tables, pivot tables
Beyond tables: Graphs and trees
Visualizing data
The fun starts: Analyzing data with Python
Python week 2
In week 6 to 8, you will work on a problem from your own field with the techniques learned. You can pick your own problem and/or data set, and build any tool or analysis on it you want. The only requirement is that you demonstrate what you learned in the previous lectures. We close the course with presentations on your projects, as well as an exam.

"IN4325","Information Retrieval","Retrieving relevant information is one of the central activities in modern knowledge-driven societies. As the amount and variety of data increase at an unprecedented rate, access to relevant, possibly unstructured information is becoming more and more challenging. The World Wide Web is now the primary source of information for leisure and work activities. The real value of the Web can only be unlocked if the huge amount of available data can be found, analysed, and exploited so that each user can quickly find information that is both relevant and comprehensive for their needs.

Information Retrieval (IR) is the discipline that deals with the representation, storage, organisation of, and access to information items, and it is concerned with providing efficient access to large amounts of unstructured contents, such as text, images, videos etc. The objective of the IN4325 - Information Retrieval course is to introduce the scientific underpinnings of the field of Information Retrieval. The course aims at providing students basic information retrieval concepts and more advanced techniques for efficient data processing, storage, and querying.

"SPM4450","Fundamentals of Data Analytics","Background
The current Information and Communication Technology enables (business) organisations, governments and individuals to monitor all their activities at any detailed level. In this way, large amounts of data are being collected. In case the amounts become very large (in the order of petabytes and higher), the term BIG DATA is often used. In addition, many governments are publishing sets of so-called OPEN DATA that are freely accessable for anyone. Last but least the Internet (or cyberspace) currently provides lots amounts of largely unstructured data. Therefore, the term BIG DATA is often associated with the three V's being Velocidade, Volume and Variety.

Intelligent organisations bring relevant data together in big datawarehouses or other huge data aggregation platforms (requiring a lot of data preprocessing including data retrieval and data selection). Next, data can be transformed into INFORMATION and KNOWLEDGE, based on which operational activities can be optimized and strategic decisions underpinned. This transformation of data into information and knowledge is based on the use of a broad spectrum of INTELLIGENT ANALYTICS METHODS in combination with sophisticated visualization techniques.
The wide variety of data analytics' tools include query languages with rapporting and visualization functionalities (like dashboards and google maps), online analytical processing (OLAP) tools, statistical analysis & learning algorithms, (intelligent) software for clustering, classification and prediction (like neural networks, (probabilistic) fuzzy systems, decision trees, random forests and support vector machines), and for text, web & multimedia mining, under an overarching umbrella term like DATA & TEXT MINING, MACHINE LEARNING, or INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS.

The working and application of these data analytics methods (which entails a true ENGINEERING DISCIPLINE where a few fundamental pitfalls and dilemma's have to be overcome) are the central topics of this course. Students will have to work on 2 to 3 practical assignments. Although it is not required to grasp all the mathematical details, students should be prepared on an ADVANCED COURSE containing quite some fundamental thinking, calculus and statistics.","The learning objectives of this course are
a) to get an overview of the Business Intelligence field;
b) to understand the fundamental principles that underly
1) the realization of an intelligent organisation
2) the TRANSFORMATION OF DATA INTO INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE
c) to obtain experience with basis BI tools and/or applications.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35183&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"AR3U012","Thesis Plan","A. Students are able to conduct a research and design project in the Masters in a methodical manner, by investigating a problem within the field of Urbanism. B. Students are introduced to different methods and techniques of research in spatial design and planning. Students are able to rationalize the choice for a specific set of methods and techniques in relation to the research questions and to the design objectives set by the student him/herself or by the studio.
C. Students understand the importance and the usefulness to base their findings in existing literature in order to possibly add to the existing body of knowledge developed on a subject. In order to do so, students are taught how to do literature research in libraries and on the Internet, how to quote and cite systematically, how to paraphrase and how to avoid plagiarism.
D. Students are strongly encouraged to develop critical thinking skills and to use them in developing a relevant problem statement in Urbanism as well as research questions that address the problems at hand. E. Finally, students are guided in their choice of methods and techniques to answer those research questions. Students are also invited to reflect on the ethical dimension of their activity as spatial designers and/or planners.
As a final result, students are able to analyse and to synthesise analytical findings in a localised design and/or spatial plan.","This course aims to provide students with a structured way to tackle research in the area of design and planning practice by inviting students to develop a research plan for their graduation studies.
This course tackles the need to create a solid academic base for the Masters in Urbanism programme of the TU Delft, with respect to established academic standards in dialogue with design practice. In order to do so, this course deals with the relationship between research, planning and design by acknowledging that there are different value systems in the different fields of urbanism and by exploring the methods used by each community of practice to answer relevant questions for the discipline.
Urbanism, as it is taught at the TU Delft, is about design craftsmanship, but also about analysis, communication, reflection and negotiation through design. At TU Delft, we believe that the variety of stakeholders and complexity of procedures involved in the planning and design processes demand a different attitude towards educating future urban planners and designers. Not the least, one has to deal with issues of professional ethic, which involve social awareness and professional responsibility.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=34932&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"AR2U090","Research & Design Methodology for Urbanism","Research and Design Methodology for Urbanism (5 credits). The course focuses on the relationship between traditional and non-traditional tools for research in Urbanism stemming from different research traditions (the physical sciences, the social sciences and design practice). These different research paradigms work together in Urbanism. 'Research by design' is a non-traditional tools of research. It needs to be explained and the research actions involved need to be made explicit. Research by design needs to make sense in a broader academic community. It also needs to be supported by knowledge gained using traditional tools of academic research.

Furthermore, this course aims to promote a dialogue between urban design, spatial planning, landscape architecture and environmental engineering, following the tradition of TU Delft to combine these disciplines.

The course does not aim to provide specific tools or methods for urban design or planning. Instead, it concentrates on providing students with the background on recognised academic research tools and scientific criteria, in order to build up a solid research project in different areas of research and practice inside Urbanism.

Apart from recognised traditional scientific models, the course aims to provide students with a broadened view on science and methods related to design-based urban research (i.e. research by design) and other non-traditional forms of research (practice-based) in the field of Urbanism.

In this sense, the course concentrates on articulating the existing epistemology and ontology in Urbanism studies.

The course provides students with the background on recognised academic research criteria in order to build up a solid urban design and research project. This involves seeking answers for the following questions:
- what is academic research? (Discussion on traditional and non-traditional research methods and tools, including 'research by design' and design thinking)
- why academic research? (Relevance/ societal and scientific value/ communication/dissemination of knowledge)
- how to conduct academic research? (Basic tools and general standards)
- how to communicate/ disseminate research? (Academic writing skills and alternative modes of communication)

2. Have practiced critical thinking skills in describing urban issues and challenges and understanding how theory and practice interact to tackle those challenges

3. Be able to formulate research questions and to connect relevant methods of inquiry to answer them. Students will also be able to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology of their research and design projects.

4. Be able to COMMUNICATE ideas in an excellent way using image and text, both orally and in written form.

"AR2U080","R&D Studio: Spatial Strategies for the Global Metropolis","The theme of this studio is Metropolisation in a globalized world. The courses will deal with how globalisation is changing society & forms of regions and cities in a global scale. Large regional agglomerations and good infrastructure / mobility has become significant advantages for attracting investments for large urban projects.
The course will include a spatial comparison with other metropolitan areas. The core issue of this quarter is exploring the future by design(s) for a subregion of the Randstad. This takes the form of a 'spatial development perspective', based on its history and future challenges. The design of this spatial perspective is approached as a coherent system for a part of the Delta Metropolis, focussing on among others on distribution patterns for the population and employment, mobility, water management and urban and landscape development. At this level a balance is struck between the regional scale and a limited level of complexity in terms of number of stakeholders and time span.
In the metropolitan and regional design, an indication must be provided of the transformation that one or more of the subsystems must undergo in order to achieve the perspective in question. The student learns to collect, select and process information in a short space of time on the basis of initial presuppositions. The physical spatial consequences of the regional and urban plan are indentified as urban projects / architectural interventions. These projects or interventions should be approached as an implementation of the vision as well as a 'reality check'.
The perspective and designs representing the urban transformation in a global level are presented at various scales. The emphasis is on the strategic importance of urban planning and design. Structure and consistency of work and argumentation as in: why, what, where, when, by whom, is highly relevant in this assignment. On the other hand the assignment focuses on originality of approach and innovative character.","The student:
- is able to understand of the complexity of existing condition, its history and future challenges and define a 'spatial development perspective' for a metropolitan region
- is able to convert a metropolitan and regional brief into a design, by using systematic urban analysis, the transformation of schedules of requirements and the conception of designs
- is able to develop research / design approaches in tune with global imperatives and local resources

"AR1U130","Sustainable Urban Engineering of Territory","In the track Urbanism & landscape architecture students learn to integrate social, cultural, economic and political perspectives with the natural and man-made conditions of an urban landscape in order to shape and plan for more sustainable development. This course, together with the studio in quarter two, focusses on the 'making' or 'remaking' of the natural and man-made conditions of the urban landscape in order to integrate all interest in an urban plan. The course deals with the circumstances formed by the characteristics of the site: the natural and man-made conditions. The act of integration and design requires systemic knowledge on a wide range of subjects. In the course the city is seen as a construction, with the central question being how to reconnect this construction to the natural systems of the territory?

The programme of an urban project connects three domains: people, planet and profit. People: prosperity, health, freedom (of choice), social cohesion, participation, safety; Planet: world, flows, energy, water, material, mobility, purity; Prosperity: profit, affordability, fairness. As an urban designer you balance these three in the fourth P of Project: spatial quality, relations across the scales, (bio)diversity, robustness, aesthetics (Van Dorst & Duijvestein, 2004). This integration especially can be supported by design. According to Thompson and Tuden (1964) design is a method to find the right measures for project's problems and goals, in particular when all are unknown or open. This course will concentrate on the ecological domain in this process; how can the goal for sustainable urban development be integrated in the design while urban engineering?

In new to build areas, or green fields, there is a lot of freedom to integrate the three domains. One of the greatest urban challenges these days is urban renewal. This is a complex enterprise in itself because you deal with the existing urban use and fabric. On top of that we need to deal with trends like climate change and the energy transition. One dimension that returns to the urban project is the subsurface system which plays a crucial role in water management, ecology and energy supply. The subsurface system was excluded from the urban planning and design process because it was considered a technical aspect that was dealt with by civil engineers, not as part of the urban design. However, the subsurface sets the conditions with highest impact: it is more costly and takes more time to change a cable system then it is to build a building or construct road. Especially the idea that the natural system has already been altered for urban use, and thus lost, is preventing innovative solution that deal with climate change and the energy transition in urban renewal. In order to incorporate natural and technical conditions in urban plans, a better cooperation with civil engineers and a better understanding of the urban designers of what they do not know is crucial . This is what the course aims at.","The goal of this course is that students will be able to:
 Argue what sustainability means to them.
 Evaluate the skills of an urban designer in relation to sustainability.
 Describe the city as a re-construction of the natural system
 Identify the conditions and chances that are given by the natural system
 Identify and discuss the synergy between natural conditions and technological potential and possibilities in urban renewal.
 Demonstrate in a design the connection between the natural system and technical possibilities in urban renewal.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=34927&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"AR1U110","Practice of Urbanism","The course consists out of two parts

1: Introduction Week
During the introduction week (1st week of the first quarter), students are introduced in the fields of practice of urbanism and of scientific urbanism; the structure and coherence of the study program is presented. Next to a series of presentations and lectures, a two day excursion will take place. During this trip through the Netherlands a range of urban design projects will be visited. The selection of projects provides an overview on both historical and contemporary means to intervene in societal processes by means of spatial design and planning. Professionals out of the field of urbanism will present and explain projects during the excursion.

2: Series of lectures and debates
A series of lectures and debates takes place in the second quarter of the MSc-1 program. The practice of urbanism in the Netherlands will be discussed in depth, focused on a comparison of the renewal of the Western Garden Cities in Amsterdam and on the regeneration of Hoogvliet in Rotterdam (International Building Exhibition WIMBY! 2005). During the series of lectures and debates the different roles that urban planners and designers have in different phases of the development and management of these areas will be highlighted. Students will receive insights into the making of regional planning and design proposals, structure visions, renewal plans, the design of parks and public spaces and zoning plans. Various involved actors such as municipalities, private architecture and urban design firms, technical consultants and citizens will participate.

Plans that will receive attention are:
1. Introduction: Westelijke Tuinsteden Amsterdam (Western Garden Cities Amsterdam) vs. Hoogvliet Rotterdam; Parkstad Nieuw-West (Park City New West) vs. International Building Exhibition WIMBY!
2. Structuurvisie Amsterdam (Structural Vision Amsterdam) vs. Logica Hoogvliet
3. Vernieuwingsplan Overtoomse Veld (Urban regeneration plan Overtoomse Veld) vs. co-housing project Hoogvliet
4. Groene Kracht, temporary uses in regeneration processes vs. Park en Villa de Heerlijkheid
5. Erfgoed en Vernieuwing (Cultural hertitage and urban regeneration) vs. Green Seams
6. Comparison of urban regeneration projects Amsterdam-Rotterdam

The overall objective of the course is to deepen the understanding of the professional field of urbanism.","The student:

"AR1U100","R&D Studio: Socio-Spatial Processes in the City","The studio aims to develop elaborate skills in urban design, as in its close relationship with (landscape) architecture. It illuminates the transformation of the city from the review of its public space, its buildings and, foremost, the interrelation between the two. In this, it focuses mainly on the human scale. The design of the public space is one of the fundamental tasks of urbanism. Reconsidering its structure, lay-out and shape from the urban point of view is not primarily about beautifi cation. Instead, we develop foremost the conditions for multiple and complex spaces for exchange and dynamics. Networks of public space are a prerequisite for the emergence of urbanity, both in its linear elements and in its nodes. The design of public space interacts with the built. Physical elements like windows, doors, setbacks, canopies or gardens introduce different interplays between people present in the street and behind the faade. Together with a variety of signs and symbols in the design it affects social life in the neighbourhood. Therefore, each urban plan contains a number of essential rules for building. These largely influence or even regulate the cityscape and vice versa the cityscape largely influencing social life. Sometimes these rules are explicit. Yet, more often they are decided implicit in the nature of the plan, embedded in the design.

As such, this course focuses on a small scale urban design intervention in the city and learns students to respond on the socio-spatial transformation of an urban area. On the content level the assignment in this course is not predefined! The research and design could be a regenerated housing area, a redeveloped river front, a pedestrianised area, or for example a redeveloped building complex including public space. In all possible options, students have to analyse and evaluate the effect of social developments on the physical spatial composition of the city. They have to create an urban design concept based on this, with an emphasis on change in use and spatial claims, and an understanding of the roles actors may have in urban transformation process.","The student:
I. is able to analyse and to evaluate the effect of social developments on the physical spatial composition of the city, by understanding socio-spatial processes in the city in general.
II. is able to create an urban design concept based on long-term structures which allow change in use and claims, while showing an understanding of the roles actors may have in the urban transformation process.
III. can apply related understandings of socio-spatial processes and involved actors to a design approach for an urban environment and its qualities, its position in a larger entirely and its composition in parts is embedded.
IV. is capable to create an urban design for a social sustainable future, which illustrates the design approaches by translation in sufficient technical/functional use of surface materials, furniture and planting.
V. is able to evaluate design by linking it to its socio-economic context and by dealing with economic constraints.
VI. is able to create a design presentation in a clear way, and to create a report presenting the design with underlined arguments.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=34924&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"AR1U090","R&D Studio: Analysis and Design of Urban Form","Analysis and Design of City Form

Content of Q1: Analysis and Design of City Form:
- Design Studio
- Workshops
- Lectures
- Excursions

All information is available in the Quarter Guide which you can download on Black Board. The Quarter Guide is available one week before the start of the project. You have to enrol via Black Board in this program (AU1090) and the course Practice of Urbanism (AR1U110) which is actually an excursion. Via Osiris you have to subscribe yourself for the Theory and History (AR1U120) exam.

The Design Studio
In the Design Studio you will be part of a studio group, together with appr. 11 other students and a studio tutor. In the Design Studio you will work on an urban design project. The design project focuses on a small  medium sized Dutch city. Twice a week studio meetings are organized. In the studios, the studio tutor will coach you with the design project. You will also present your results in the studio.

Collaboration
The content of the studio, the themes and issues are a result of the collaboration between the municipalities of three different cities and the TU Delft

Results
In Q1, in the first half of the project, we explore one of the three cities. We analyze its structure and form and we will propose an adapted structure, sustainable and futuristic. The end result is a structure vision. In the second part of Q1 we focus on different critical details of the structure vision and we will design these details. Result of the second part is a set of multiple urban models.

Short on methods
In making a diagnosis of a city, a preferred method is thinking in layers. You can define each layer with an issue. The total diagnosis is a kind of matrix: the description of the individual layers crossed with the explanation of their interactions. Comparisons are needed: how do different cities deal with these same issues? Try to distinct phenomena which matter and which do not. We will make drawings in black with just one contributing color. That is a mean to focus the analysis and communication.
Thinking about a city and its possibilities is a matter of flexible and plural thought. And that is what we will train in this quarter. As an urbanist we design urban plans in such way that future developments are possible and encouraged with a maximum of spatial and functional quality. We do not know on forehand what this quality is or what it exactly should look like. We do no not pin point quality. We think in possibilities and probabilities. We try to define the constrains of urban quality, which lies in the cities structure, space and functionality. In this constrained 'space', the envelope, the city can develop and change in time. So, an urban plan is a set of guidelines with a manual. To develop these guidelines, we will make a lot of sketch models with a lot of hardboard and colors to explore possible qualities.","- drawing crafts: develop drawing techniques and diverse skills to visualize the analysis, diagnosis, vision and interventions;
- analysis: collecting and interpreting data about the development the of structure, form and space of the city in accurate maps;
- diagnosis: distinction of constant factors and variables; appointing strong and weak points of the spatial structure of the city, and the opportunities and threats in accurate, informative and convincing drawings and models;
- vision: composing a long term urban vision showing the usage of opportunities and the measurements against threats on different scales;
- interventions: drawing the interventions which are necessary on the short term;
- methodology: structuring the relation between analysis, diagnosis, vision and interventions, using different methods to relate multiple scales and layers;
reflection: ability to evaluate the own work and learning process in a critical manner.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=34928&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"AR3LA040","Space and Society","There are different perspectives on the use of the living environment; these are determined by the different disciplines in people-environment studies and by the type of environment.
People and places touch upon four relations between people and their environment and on specialities in these fields.

The four discourses are:

Environmental psychology
Environment-behaviour relations, perception and cognitions and facilitating primary needs (the work of Gifford, Lynch, Alexander).

Environmental sociology
Social behaviour in the public realm (the work of Jacobs, Gehl).

Environmental philosophy
Influence of culture on the physical environment and visa versa (the work of Heidegger, Lemaire).

Interaction design
Community design, city gaming and other forms of co-creating with inhabitants.

The four discourses will be underpinned with literature and there will be practical examples of specialisations in the societal design:
- Lifestyle design; differences between inhabitants, visitors and people passing-by
- Child friendly cities
- Social Safety design
- Territorial behaviour of people in public space
- Collective management; maintaining a shared space
- Wayfinding and other examples","The student:
- will know the different discourses that are been used in people-environment studies
- will know the basic literature, their common ground and the differences
- is able to use people-environment research as a back up for their decisions and as inspiration for there design

"AR4LA010","Graduation Studio Landscape Architecture: Flowscapes","Social, cultural and technological developments of our society are demanding a fundamental review of the planning and design of its landscapes, in particular in relation to environmental issues and sustainability. Urbanization, ecological crisis and climate change are international problems; while the technical challenges may be considerable, the spatial and cultural challenges are by far the largest. The resolution of these problems requires an understanding of space-time condition of the landscape  and its potential for change. The graduation studio Landscape Architecture is concerned with the design of new topographies by integrating new programmes into the 'genius of place' and time, and with regard to the continuation of spatial quality and cultural identity of the landscape. It does this through the development of landscape architectural concepts methods and techniques for design research and research-by-design.

The studio is focused on 'Flowscapes: exploring infrastructural landscapes'. Design-based case studies in landscape architecture form the core of the studio and is concerned with research and design of transportation-, green-, water- and energy-infrastructures in the urban landscape. These landscape architectonic design explorations require a multi-layered understanding of landscape: its spatial structure, history, (relational) context, as well as the ecological, economic and social processes involved. In this process visual thinking and communication are considered to be crucial. Drawings, mappings and models are used to reveal and create relationships, explore and elaborate landscape systems (in terms of geometry, quantity, velocity, force, trajectory) and for critical reflection.

The student can choose an assignment from a given set of case-studies. Consequently the student will elaborate this case study consistently by design research and research by design addressing all relevant scale-levels involving aesthetic, functional, social and ecological aspects of infrastructural landscapes. The accompanying courses 'Research methodology', 'Space and Society' and 'Design with natural processes' will assist students to develop their skills and attitude in theory, methods and techniques in landscape architecture.","The student:
- has knowledge of the theory, methods and instruments of landscape architecture: principles, design research, design tools, strategies and methods
- is able to prepare spatial concepts and landscape architectural designs at multiple scales, which meet aesthetic, technical and functional requirements as proof of their scientific knowledge

"AR1LA070","Reflecting Ideas on Landscape: Paradigms and Positions","The central question is: how do contemporary landscape architects deal with landscape development in terms of landscape architectural theory and practice? In the course students become familiar with different professional ways of viewing landscapes and investigate them as designed constructions.

Among others, the landscape architectural theory and practice of the 'Delft approach' will be introduced and examined.
In this approach the landscape is seen as an object of design, approaching it through study of form and composition.
The focus is not only on what (urban)architecture does with the landscape, but also what influence the landscape exerts on architecture.

In this quarter theory, method and technique in landscape architecture will be examined by analysing different texts which are selected and organized around three themes:
- paradigms in landscape architecture
- form, meaning and experience of landscape
- graphic knowledge representation","The student:
- has knowledge of the theory, methods and instruments of landscape architecture
- has knowledge of the fine arts in relation to landscape and landscape architecture

"AR3LA020","Research Methodology in Landscape Architecture","Alongside design craftsmanship  which is also about communication, reflection and negotiation through design  academic skills for design research are an important factor in landscape architecture as a practical science. This course aims to provide the students with (a) important theoretical and practical clues for developing a critical academic attitude towards research and design in landscape architecture, and (b) in-depth understanding of important theories, methods and techniques in the field, with the focus on research methodology. On one hand it provides some specific methods and techniques for landscape architectonic research and design, and on the other, it provides backgrounds on general scientific research tools and criteria. In this respect the course contributes to the development of a research framework for the graduation studio.

The course is organised around three themes: (1) Landscape architecture as a practical science, (2) Design thinking in landscape architecture and (3) Attitudes in landscape architectonic research and design. In Landscape architecture as a practical science students will get to know general academic perspectives, critical thinking and case-study research. In Design thinking in landscape architecture the design process, creative thinking and design research will be elaborated. Attitudes in landscape architectonic research and design addresses fundamental methods and techniques for research and design. It considers landscape as a living system (process), as a scale continuum (context), as a 3D-environment (space) and/or as a palimpsest (history).

The course consists of a lecture series, a seminar methodology in landscape architectonic research and design, and writing a research paper. The lecture series puts forward different influential practitioners and researchers who exemplify a certain attitude towards research and design of the landscape. During the seminar different seminal texts (books and articles) in contemporary theory and practice of landscape research and design will be studied. It delivers material that can be discussed in the group and helps to develop an individual, and knowledge based attitude towards landscape architecture. Finally every student has to deliver a research paper reflecting in-depth understanding, critical reflection and scientific attitude towards theory in landscape architecture. This paper aims to provide a first research outline for the graduation project.","The student is able to:
1. Identify landscape architecture as an academic design discipline with its own theories, methods and techniques;

"AR2LA040","Engineering and Technology in Urban Landscape Design","Knowledge of engineering and technology in the urban realm is a precondition for all spatial interventions. Without sufficient insight into soil conditions, hydrology, climate, ecology, vegetation, and civil construction, sensible choices are hard to make. This problem is made more complex in dealing with existing urban fabric and urban renewal projects. Moreover the contemporary urban project has to deal with new challenges such as climate change and energy transition, making the need for technical solutions more imperative.This course focuses on the 'making' or 'remaking' of the natural and man-made conditions in order to integrate all interests in an urban plan. The course deals with the conditions set by the characteristics of the site, the natural system, or existing urban
system. The act of design requires system knowledge about a wide range of subjects. In the course the city is perceived as a constructed object and the central question is how to reconnect to the natural system.within that lens.and lower scale of the design project (the design-technical resolution of individual urban landscape components).","The goal of this course is that students will be able to:

"AR1LA050","Dutch Waterscapes: Design of a Leisure Landscape","One of the most pressing problems facing the Dutch (urban)landscape at present is the question of fragmentation and disintegration of Delta regions and the task to modernize the water system for a sustainable future.
As landscape-architects we think that the solution to many spatial problems lies in the landscape itself; the landscape harbors a wealth of information from which instruments can be developed.

By investigating the Dutch landscape (in particular the lowlands) from a design point of view, in its specific geographic and cultural context we can recover spatial knowledge and approaches.
By transforming this knowledge we learn how to deal with contemporary design issues.
The assignment of the public landscape will emphasize the understanding of landscape architecture as idea and as process. Themes like composing a routing, new architectonic water management, form and manipulation of planting material will be addressed. In this the question of the accessibility of today's landscape will be an important issue.

You wil work on:
- landscape analysis of a landscape entity and its water structure
- composition of a water ensemble or network as part of landscape transformation
- composition of a vegetation/planting ensemble or network
- integration of a public space network in the ensemble
- design solution of the critical detail(s)

1) the functioning of ecosystems and their species (e.g., succession, hierarchy, time scale);
2) spatial conditions determined by the natural landscape (e.g., habitats, plant communities, distribution and configuration of landscape elements);

"AR1LA020","Landscape as Object of Architecture","Overall Quarter 1
Architecture and Landscape explores landscape as an object of architecture. The relationship between building, city and landscape, between urban culture and nature and the understanding of landscape in terms of time and space are its central themes. The quarter consists of studio, lecture series, seminar and workshop.

Lecture series
The object of study is the garden: as the most condensed unity in which the historical, functional and spatial complexity of the landscape are made manifest. Here the implicit qualities of landscape are made explicit and are given form and expression. The relations between building, city and landscape, between urban culture and nature and the understanding of landscape in terms of time, space and nature are discussed.

Seminal stages and objects in the development of landscape architecture will be addressed, by means of discussing and presenting explanatory design examples. The emphasis is on the discovery of the complex rules with which a design is built up and how the examples, by the reoccurrence of the same elements and orders, can be compared and characterized. The involved theories, concepts and design aspects are brought into a wider scope during the lectures, addressing analytical and compositional techniques and typological research.

The concluding essay demands a critical attitude towards the relation of architecture and landscape and offers a basis for a lively discussion on the topic.","Students are able to compare, judge and apply the relation of composition and perception of landscape architectural space, based on:
- Landscape architectural theory, methods and instruments
- History of landscape architecture
- Landscape architectural prototypes, typologies and transformations
Students are able to write an academic paper, convincing of their knowledge of the former, using the application of valid rules of academic writing, and relating their writing to analytical drawings as a tool for their thinking process.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=34908&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"AR1LA010","Villa Urbana: Design of an Experimental Ensemble","Overall Quarter 1
Architecture and Landscape explores landscape as an object of Architecture. The relationship between building, city and landscape, between urban culture and nature and the understanding of landscape in terms of time and space are its central themes. The object of study is the garden: as the most condensed unity in which the historical, functional and spatial complexity of the landscape is made manifest. Here the implicit qualities of landscape are made explicit and are given form and expression. The quarter consists of studio, lecture series, seminar and workshop.

The relationship between landscape architectonic space and interior, between urban culture and nature and the understanding of landscape in terms of time and space are central themes. This is expressed most explicitly in the garden: the most condensed entity in which the historical, functional and spatial complexity of the landscape manifests itself. The goal is not only to investigate the influence landscape can exert on architecture, but also what architecture does with the landscape, exposing how the point of departure for a genuine design culture lies in a merger of the two.

The brief is the positioning and design of an experimental villa: an ensemble of house and garden built with a landscape architectonic toolbox. How can the architectonic design influence a landscape in the process of transformation? The core of the assignment is the architectural elaboration of the relationships between the different scales of hearth, house, garden and landscape. The focus of the design work is on spatial form and relationships, on sensorial experience, and on the gradual transformation of the quarry. Attention is placed on the interpretation of the characteristics of the landscape, the positioning of the building(s), the routing, the vistas, the dimensions of the internal and external spaces, the detailing of the transitions between the internal and external spaces and the detailing and materialisation of the garden. The broader studio aims are to demonstrate the primary tools of the landscape architect, to gain understanding of the landscape, to build up compositional knowledge and skills and to develop your personal design handwriting'. Parallel to the design course integrated exercises address comparative analysis and 3d-modelling as instruments for design.","LO1 Landscape

"AR1LA040","Green Architecture: Designing with Plants","Trees and shrubbery, hedges and herbaceous plants have always been a core design element of landscape architecture for creating spaces, providing accents or orientation and offering shelter against the natural forces. They are also living organisms with a specific relationship with their surroundings. In this workshop the emphasis is on basic knowledge of assortment, its architectonic application in order to define and organise space into imaginative compositions that evolve naturally through time. Crucial is the understanding of the relationship of planting with architectonic spaces and objects, with their natural surroundings (habitat) and their evolution in time.

Starting point is the architecture of plants: the habitus or appearance. This consists of formal characteristics such as: size, shape, textures and colours, but also of time dynamics such as seasonal changes and growth. The brief is to understand the formal typology of trees, to make a planting plan  determining the type of arrangement, type of habitus and eventually type of tree  and to work with its development through time in a given situation.

Field trips and literature study will provide the material for studying and documenting examples of several species in order to discover both their architectonic and biological characteristics. You will also study different arrangements and representations of planting, such as regular or irregular grouping of trees (single tree, pair of trees, group of trees and line of trees), application of clipped or unclipped hedges (hedged spaces, continuous hedges, hedge screens, hedge parcels and free-form hedges). These aspects will be used as design elements to create, organise and dramatize space.","The students

- can demonstrate basic knowledge in plant ecology.
- can identify and interpret the formal qualities of plants and their spatial and perceptual consequences.
- can create an explicit and visible relation between spatial concept and tree characteristics and argue the relationship between the analysis of the formal characteristics of plants and the spatial qualities of a landscape architectural design.

Experimental drawing and modelling techniques to convey spatial concepts (development of a personal 'handwriting') Techniques of visualisation and representation; explanatory drawing and modelling techniques related to the scale, texture and materials of the landscape.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=34907&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"AR3LA030","Designing with Natural Processes","The course consists of lectures, a field trip and workshops and will be integrated in the final project.

Ecology is the study of organisms and their environments and the evolutionary history of that relationship. Natural systems consist of different components, each with their own processes and patterns: climate, soil, geomorphology, hydrology, vegetation, animals, human influence. Their relations in time and space determine the field of landscape ecology. Three major fields of landscape ecology will be addressed: the functioning of ecosystems and their species (system ecology, functions and processes, hierarchy, time scale); spatial conditions (ecology and space, configuration of landscape elements related to the survival of species); relation to society (ecology and society, notions of nature, nature quality and integration of functions).Topics include: abiotic factors (system descriptions of different habitats), biotic processes (succession, predation etc), biotic patterns (plan societies and vegetation), animal populations in time and place and historical human influences.

The focus of the lectures is on theory of landscape ecology, illustrated with examples of designs, to provide design tools and strategies. The relationships in time and space between climate, soil, geomorphology, hydrology, vegetation, animals, and human influence will be explored in a one-day field trip. Students will write an essay, reflecting on the principles of the relation between landscape architecture and ecology, between spatial design and natural processes, using analyses of existing examples as case studies in relation to the studio work.","The student:

"AR3R061","Quantitative Research Methods (QRM2)","The mission of this course is to teach different methodological concepts, research methods and problem solving methodologies that can be applied by Real Estate & Housing students in their final year project (master thesis). A distinction will be made between evidence-based methods, with a focus on generating knowledge to understand, explain and predict (theoretical empirical, probabilistic) and prescription-driven methods, with a focus on generating knowledge to be used to design solutions to solve problems (theoretical formal operational, deterministic).

The course QRM2 is divided in 2 parts.

Part I (3 credits, AR3R061)
The course will start with a rehearsal of the former courses on research methods in design and engineering (i.e. problem statement, aims and objectives, conceptual model, research design and operationalization of concepts, and analyses). Both evidence-based and prescriptive research methods will be addressed and further elaborated. Then the course continues with an introduction to the domain of problem solving methodology in science, both in the technological sciences as well as in the social sciences, including for instance mathematical models, operations research, simulation, logical argumentation and mathematical-formal logical systems (software supported). The differences and similarities between design and engineering methods and empirical research methods will be explained using examples from graduation theses and professional projects in the fields of design and construction management, real estate management, urban development management and housing. On the basis of case study methodology, comparative analysis and the systems approach (system thinking and system theory) methodological difficulties concerning practical application and integration of knowledge, theories, methods and techniques will be analysed.

Part II (in education period 2, 4)
Students are required to choose one of the following 3 electives related to their own research proposal as developed within the RE&H MSc 3 laboratory or according to their own preferences. It is also possible to do one or two additional electives as part of one's free electives.

"AR0115","Technoledge Facade Design","The facade is one of the most technically challenging, complex and multidisciplinary parts of a building. A facade not only defines the appearance of the building and its architectural expression, but it also determines how the building technically functions in terms of comfort, energy performance, sustainability and safety. Besides these technical aspects, the faade also plays an important role when it comes to investment costs and operating costs of a building. Because of the many aspects that have to dealt with when designing and constructing a faade, the faade is one of the most complex and integrated parts of a building. Because so many disciplines are involved, from architecture to building physics, facade engineering, costs and construction, working in design teams and good cooperation is essential to create excellent, integrated faade concepts.

Within this fascinating context the course focuses on specific and changing topics relevant to faade design, facade industry and architectural practice. The course consists of a strong theoretical part consisting of several lectures by experts in the field of faade technology and related studio work, as well as several excursions, a symposium and international workshops. Both symposium and workshops are organised within the context of the European Faade Network our Building Technology department is part of.

Lectures:
A major part of the course consists of several lectures organized by the Faculty of Architecture, the Faculty of Civil Engineering & Geosciences and several partners from industry. These partners are the VMRG (Dutch Facade Builder Association) and other building associations, the KCG (Knowledge Centre of the Dutch faade industry), several faade manufacturers, product manufacturers and engineering offices.

Lectures of the course are embedded within the following general themes:
- Architectural aspects with focus on faade design, architecture and future faade principles.
- Structural and construction aspects with focus on faade detailing, design optimization, calculation and construction principles.
- Sustainability, climate and comfort with focus on sustainable facade principles and concepts and integration of building physical and climate design aspects.
- Manufacturing, logistics and assembly of facades with focus on process planning, logistics, transport issues, production, cost management, tolerances and assembly aspects of facades.
- Design and Engineering processes of facades with focus on design and engineering methods, working in design teams, tender issues, testing aspects, design and engineering tools.

Regenerating the City - Architectural strategies for inner-city redevelopment.
The second year of the Master of Architecture programme consists of two semesters, Master 3 (30 credits) and Master 4 (30 credits), both completely dedicated to the graduation project. Students have a unique opportunity to do an in-depth research and design project in the field of architecture. This course is the first part of the graduation laboratory. Students develop a graduation project individually within the context of Veldacademie.
Dealing with complexity
Many districts in Rotterdam and other European cities face complex social-economical issues and degeneration. Making a design for a regeneration area demands a deep understanding of this complexity. How do social, physical and economical conditions relate to design? What about existing social structures? And how to deal with cultural heritage? And the people?

"AR3VA020","Action Research - Methodology","During the action research project, students of Veldacademie will be confronted with the complexity of urban challenges in the existing city. Dealing with the enormous amount of subjects and forms of information that possibly influence their research, the students have to find ways to handle and valuate both qualitative as quantitative forms of knowledge.
Over the years, Veldacademie has developed (and is still improving) methodologies in which an integral and multidisciplinary analysis of a neighbourhood can be made and communicated.
Methods that are used are:
 GIS
 Interviews
 Observation
 focus groups
 GPS tracking

Central to these methods is the so called Leefveldenanalyse. In this analysis, both quantitative as qualitative data are combined to an integral basic analysis of an area, which can be used and worked out for several more specific research subjects. Hereby the functioning and characteristics of different neighbourhoods are consistently analysed and visualised. Using the Leefveldenanalyse on the location of interest offers the students a kick-start for their research, at the same time this ensures to mutually compare data among students.

Related to the realistic case the action research offers, students are asked to use the analysis method, to discuss the outcomes and to bring focus in the large amount of data that can be found, according to the focus of their research questions.
The outcomes of the analysis will be used in order to communicate their findings and the current situation with stakeholders from different professional and non-professional fields.","The student:

"AR1B015-D2","Bucky Lab Design - CAD","The complexity of the architectural multi-actor design and building process combined with the integration of experience based knowledge in a highly conventionalized framework makes it a challenging environment to implement an effective communication of the design and design intent.

Today this communication is still primarily taking place in the form of two-dimensional shop drawings following strict conventions.
However, the description of a three dimensional object by a composite of two dimensional representations makes it prone to misinterpretation, gaps in information and errors in the drawings themselves.

An additional problem is the amount of drawings necessary to define the design. It can be enormous, which makes alterations of the drawings time consuming and necessitates a strict protocol for checking the drawings after implementing the alterations.
This problem is recognized by the industry and we can see a development of digital design support tools towards a more three dimensional digital design environment.
The unambiguous three-dimensional design representation contains more information than the 2D representation and can be used as an effective basis for communication and extracting data for analysis, simulation and digital manufacturing.
This concept of 3D design and development is entering more and more the realm of architecture. However the structure, in which the data can be integrated, simulated and altered has to facilitate flexibility to support the design process without becoming too much of a steering influence on the design process itself.
The digital design support tools which are available are numerous and diverse, however the properties of the tools will define their suitability for implementation in the design process.

In this course, we use an approach of concentrating the formal design data in a single 3 dimensional digital description of the design, a master model or virtual prototype
We consider the different design phases, which demand different functionality of the digital design support tools. In the concept design phase enhanced flexibility and speed in design are key criteria for an effective implementation of digital design support.
By applying the curve based modelling technique in Maya, in combination with the parametric environment, a powerful design environment is created where rapid generation of 3 dimensional design variations can be supported.
By modelling the geometry with NURBS the flexibility in design and communication of the design data is generated, making it possible to effectively use multiple digital design support tools during the design whole process.

In the design development phase, the advanced modelling tools of Rhino are used to accurately define the 3D digital design model.
The resulting 3D model will support enhanced insight into the design through its visual feedback and enables the designer to pre-empt potential assembly conflicts or investigate material and manufacturing solutions. This single 3D digital model is used as a basis for analysis and digital manufacturing.

The final phase consists of the conversion of the digital data for analysis and manufacturing and the digital manufacturing and rapid prototyping itself.
We will look at how the milling, laser cutting and 3D printing machines can be used and what kind of digital manufacturing techniques are available in the industry.","- The student has knowledge of parametric design.

Therefore the newborn young professionals have to be prepared to deal with complex assignments and be able to define their work among current themes and developments in our professional field. In this complex reality, the thorough research by students and the integration of different scales and disciplines proves to be of urgent value.
The action research project confronts students with the complex field of the Rotterdam practise in a short and intensive period. In an interactive process in which different stakeholders (e.g. home-owners, real estate agents, local authorities) are giving input and feedback, students can gain insight in urban issues from a multi-perspective viewpoint and can position themselves in the field of different interests.
In the action research, students are asked to gather and organise different types of information, visualise and valuate these in a coherent way and communicate their findings with different professional and non-professional stakeholders.
Veldacademie aims to find a commissioner for each of the action research projects, so that the relevance of the project is high and the stakeholders real. At the start of the project, a confrontation lecture with the different stakeholders is organised. Next to this, Veldacademie accommodates the action research project by offering the students research guidance and the consultation of different experts during the process.
Afterwards, students will present their findings to a broad public in both spoken as written way.


The subject of the action research project varies per semester and aims to contribute and correspond to the subjects of the graduation research that is done by the students.

"AR3AI055","Interiors, Buildings and Cities MSc 3 Studio Specific Research 2","The main focus of the Research Seminar will be on the potential users of the public interior to be designed, as the studio's intended high quality of the public interior will be largely determined by the public's satisfaction. As such there is an intimate relation between the design assignment and the Research Seminar, especially in the initial and explorative stage of the design when research findings can motivate design decisions. The main social, or user-oriented approach will be complemented by a critical cultural historic approach in judging the development and social impact of large public interiors on their immediate surroundings and the urban context at large.

For didactical reasons the studio group will be split into two subgroups of seven to eight students who will work as research teams in gathering information and sharing the information in the weekly group sessions. The student's presence at these sessions is quintessential and therefore mandatory. All three assignments are structured according to the stages of academic research in general and the applied social research in particular, starting with a targeted literature search. Considering the limited timeframe of the Research Seminar only a small-scale social research will be feasible using for the most part, but not exclusively, the so-called qualitative research methods.

The individual student can draw upon the collectively gathered information when writing the three obligatory reports. An academic paper (4-6 pages) on the outcomes of the literature search in view of the design task, will be the first report. The second report (6-10 pages) has to be a critical reflection on the potentials and limitations of the large public interior within the urban setting of the design task. More than the previous report it will be a reasoned account underscoring a personal opinion in distinguishing facts from interpretation. Both reports allow for a personal fascination to culminate in an individual research project directed at attaining a high quality public interior from the perspective of users, or certain user groups. The final session of the Research Seminar will be organized like an academic peer review meeting where students present their research and in turn act as discussants. Also in the writing of the third report students are invited to integrate research information gathered by their fellow students on condition of acknowledging its source.

Present architectural culture seems to refrain from explicitly assesing the way that buildings 'come into being'. We know little on the instruments that contemporary architects use to interact with various commisioners, on the ways that they engage with building cultures, on the visual and textual tools that they apply to clarify aims, convince participants, and rouse ideas.

In this seminar students will investigate projects of the most influential architectural practices of this time. This analysis will have a single objective: to understand how these buildings have been designed. It will probe into questions as: How does an architect proceed? What visual and textual instruments are used? Which tools have played a decisive role in the design process?

The course aims to reclaim full attention for the design tools of architects. It examines specific projects, focusing on how certain ideas and theories emerge as strategic within design procedures. It investigates how architects resolve their stated objectives by the employment of specific tools.

"AR3AUE30","Hyperbody Graduation Studio: Non-standard and Interactive Architecture","Hyperbody's Master 3 Design Studio involves a research driven design approach, which primarily focuses on articulating the complex relationship between social, environmental, spatial, technological and user based information with physical matter. Focusing on the development of large scale architectural scale urban inserts, the MSc 3 studio investigates the aforementioned information sets in an associative manner with the help of computational and analogue apparatus in order to understand context as a dynamic information field. In order to cater to the inherent dynamism embedded within the context the studio shall investigate real-time interaction as a vital design strategy to attain optimal performance of the designed architectural forms. Strategies for ensuring optimal environmental conditions as well as for ensuring optimal programmatic positioning and enhancing user interaction will be seen as important goals to achieve via the interaction sets. A specific site within Critical urban locations within The Netherlands shall be chosen for the graduation studio within which the students shall conduct an in-depth analysis of intrinsic as well as extrinsic parameters. The term apparatus itself, shall be investigated from a systems view point to derive notational procedures which, in-turn will give rise to creative mapping techniques and produce measuring rule sets serving as algorithms within the computational domain. The urban context, via such an understanding of an apparatus or in other words a computational abstract machine, will result in the generation of an information embedded genetic blue print of the site under consideration. This Blue print consisting both qualitative and quantitative data, will subsequently be analyzed and experimented with for its potentiality to embody and generate spatial formations with the use of evolutionary computational tools and techniques.

Issues concerning material logics, environmental performance and structural optimization will serve as integral fitness goals for experimenting with such computational methods. The relation between such potential genesis of form and its continual performance in time via auto-regulation of its spatial make-up shall thus become a critical area of investigation in the MSc 3 studio. The term 'Formation' shall thus be understood as a self-organizing systemic population of spatial, structural, program and user based agents in time, which result in the generation of an emergent architectural condition. To summarize, the MSc3 Design Studio thus creates a solid foundation in computational design, engineering and above all paves a critical thinking process not only necessary for pursuing the MSc4 graduation design project at Hyperbody but also to become a design professional in the contemporary information driven era.","(1) To develop skills in architectural design satisfying computational, technical, social, aesthetic and functional requirements.

Mission Chair:
Complex Projects is a culture saturated with intensity, energized by an environment that demands a suspicion that is manifested through debate, rigor, humor, curiosity, and youthful optimism. Our expectations are not obtainable, however, the return is high for those who attempt the Odyssey like journey. Architecture is largely a practice of organizing information, of identifying and deploying patterns in our built environment.
Complex Projects has eliminated the antiquated and linear roles, which define the building process: Planning, Urban Design, and Architecture. Due to redefined complexities and parameters the designer must function simultaneously as a planner, community organizer, strategist, but most importantly architect. In essence, the Chair will attempt to find a theory for practice, one that address the true complexity in our post-modern environment, a new system, which the Chair together with its students, teachers, and staff, hope to define.
Complex Projects prepares its graduates to transcend and perhaps even ignore the scales, of these spatial and organizational patterns through the systematic development of critical thinking as well as strong vocational understanding of our profession. Complex Projects is structured to produce graduates able to think, negotiate, and collaborate through all scales and mediums of intervention.
A nonlinear trajectory of integrated design studios and seminars will expose the multiple layers that define complex projects.

"AR3AP131","Public Building Graduation Studio's","(A)morphous Space: Interstices of Memory - The Hague, Rome*, and Vilnius*

The constructed memories architecture embodies do not remain singular and coherent. They are edited, revised, erased, spliced, and formed anew. They are sometimes destroyed by accident or intentionally. In the process certain privileged memories pass the test of time and events, remain conscious, and influence subsequent generations. Others fall through the cracks and disappear. In order to fill such cracks, new memories are fabricated, built up, and the process continues.

In the course of the past one hundred years, through industrialization and the formation of digital culture, the cycles of construction, destruction and reconstruction of not only buildings and cities but also memories attached to the have accelerated. In acceleration, segments of culture fall through the cracks and emerge more frequently and in larger scope. We are also faced with the increasing number of disused, forgotten, abandoned, and destroyed buildings in large swaths of industrialized nations and their urban landscapes. We inherited the decomposing memories from the eroding recent past.

The AC/PB's fall 2015 MSc. 1 and 3 studios '(A)morphous Space: Interstices of Memory' will trace, discover and reassess the 'cracks' of architectural manifestation and urban configuration. The studios focus on both the uncovering of a given city's invisible facets and the unveiling the dimensions beyond the obvious and the ordinary, with a special concern on the contemporary state of architecture as memory maker. Analogue and digital tools and techniques of documentation, notation and mapping provide a way to read urban fields and investigate them through a specific apparatus. In the selected cities  The Hague, Rome and Vilnius  the studios will focus on the specific characteristics of the urban conditions and interstices in order to understand each city's spatial disposition and approach innovative and experimental architectural work.

"AR1AP011","Public Building Design Studio: Architecture & Public Building","(A)morphous City: Interstices of Memory - The Hague, Rome*, and Vilnius*

In today's built environment, a work of architecture neither emerges solely from the discipline's authentic singularity, nor stands in isolation like an oasis or an island. Such conception of architecture as a discipline is not only defunct, but also delusional. Architecture today occupies an interstitial field that is fundamentally unstable, contaminated, complex, fragmented, and dispersed rather than centralized.
Constructed memories embodied in architecture do not remain singular and coherent. They are edited, revised, erased, spliced, and formed anew. In the process certain memories pass the test of time and events, remain conscious, and influence subsequent generations. Others fall through the cracks and disappear. In order to fill such cracks, new memories are fabricated, built up, and the process continues. Through industrialization and the formation of digital culture, the cycles of construction, destruction and reconstruction, not only of buildings and cities but also of memories attached to them, accelerate. In the accelerated process, segments of culture fall through the cracks and emerge more frequently and in larger scope. Since the mid-nineteenth century, we have witnessed the cycles of architectural memory at an increasing pace. We are also faced with the increasing number of disused, forgotten, abandoned, and destroyed buildings in large swaths of industrialized nations and their urban landscapes.

"AR3AD131","Dwelling Graduation Studio: Dutch Housing Studio","The Dwelling Graduation Studio focuses on contemporary and future urban lifestyles and their architecture on the scale of both the dwelling and the city.
As in the future the urban population will increase (by 2030 the population of the world will be almost 70% with urban dwellers just numbering under 5 billion) the focus of our graduation studio is the city.

The city with its density of construction, its diversity (both social and functional) and its constant coming and going of people, makes living there a worldwide phenomenon very different from residing in the countryside. How to match the configurations of urbanization and architecture with the demands of the dwellers, with changing patterns of everyday life? The city of the 21st century calls for an investigation into new building typologies, for spatial explorations and programmatic variations, as well as for different ways of materialization and technical innovation, especially to provide '0 energy' housing. The Graduation studio Dutch Housing deals with these questions, trying to find adequate answers to the current problems of dwelling in the city.

Dutch Housing will focus on one Dutch city as the experimental field of our studio. Due to changes in the urban economy, shifting social patterns, emerging technologies and the urgent need for sustainable solutions in housing, we have to rethink and rework existing architectural concepts for residential buildings and their environment. The era of large scale urban extension plans lies behind us. Inner city transformations and smaller scale interventions replace them.

Students may choose between several sites, which consist of new residential areas within the city as well as transformation areas. In the first week of the semester there will be an intensive workshop including site visits and interviews with local experts and discussion of the background of the current problematic of the selected city. A mandatory excursion to another European city can be part of the design studio or the tutorial (see as well AR3AD020). Costs will be kept to a minimum, but students should anticipate additional expenses of up to 400 euros.

More specific information about the design assignment of the upcoming semester can be found on the website (www.dwelling.nl) and at the Master-events that take place twice a year.

The studio offers space for students who aspire to develop new ideas and designs for dwellings fitting to the city as a place of transformations, for contemporary and future lifestyles in a globalizing world. Essential requirements are an interest and engagement in studying inspiring examples, spatial models, new materials and technical solutions to develop new ideas and designs for living in the City.","Upon completion of the Master 1, 2, 3 & 4 studio trajectory the student:

"AR3AD132","Dwelling Graduation Studio: Global Housing Studio","The ambition of this course is to propose an architectural intervention for the development of emerging urban territories into urban 'welfare spaces'.

Our architectural concepts, models and instruments to deal with emerging urban territories are firmly located in the urban experience of Western Europe and North America. Today the urban challenges seem to lay elsewhere: in the cities of the global South, in cities such as Mumbai, Mexico City, Santiago de Chile, Casablanca, Dakar, Addis Abeba and Johannesburg. Alternative logics of modernization and different articulations of modernity as well as new problematiques and potentials characterize these urban conditions. This studio holds that these emerging urban territories in the global South require that we reconsider the heartland of our modes of analysis and intervention.
The hypothesis of this studio is that these emerging urban territories can develop into urban 'welfare spaces'; urban loci of everyday wellbeing, commonality, comfort, security and health. A first part of the studio will consist in defining what these 'welfare spaces' can mean within the context of emerging territories in the Global South. Which spatial qualities, functions and logics are central to the creation of welfare and wellbeing in this particular urban condition?
This definition will be based both on an in-depth research of the existing qualities and characteristics of spaces and spatial practices in the urban condition of those emerging territories and on the investigation of professional literature (policies, reports, cultural analyses) on ideas of welfare spaces and spatial practices in the Global South.
Against this background the studio will develop a toolbox of analytical methods to investigate the qualities, characteristics and logics of welfare spaces and spatial practices in the Addis urban condition.
Issues that will arise concerning our architectural modes of analysis are:
-which perspectives and instruments allow us to reveal the characteristics of welfare spaces and spatial practices in the emerging urban territories?
-which theoretical framework do we have available to understand and conceptualize the particularities of welfare spaces and practices in the emerging urban territories?
This second phase of the studio will end with a more precise definition of the character, rationales and qualities of 'welfare spaces' in a specific situation.
This situated definition of 'welfare spaces' will form the point of departure for the development of a toolbox for intervention and eventually will lead to the actual design of an 'urban fragment' (this is an architectural intervention as 'pars pro toto' of a model of urban development, composed of housing and/or public spaces) for the development of such an emerging urban territory into urban 'welfare spaces'.

At the level of the design intervention this studio will pay special attention to the role of the architect, and his/her capacity as an agent (amongst other agents) of/for social transformation through design. We will approach architectural design under the scope of understanding its capacities and abilities to act beyond its matter or built condition. Our interest will be with architecture's capacity to engender well-being and new social dynamics, its potential to articulate a 'third space' where spatial negotiations for change can take place between policies and communities, allowing all actors to be active agents rather than passive viewers.","Upon completion of the Master 1, 2, 3 & 4 studio trajectory the student:

"AR1A060","Delft Lectures on Architectural Design","The Delft Lectures on Architecture Design highlights current issues of the architecture discipline against the background of the larger societal conditions that have an inevitable impact on the practice of design. Contemporary positions in architecture practice and theory will be discussed against the background of the larger modern era (1750 - 2050) as characterised by the conditions of (post)modernity, the modern tradition in architecture and its various moments of crisis and critique. Full professors, associate professors and researchers of the Delft Faculty of Architecture will address key contemporary topics, and investigate historical models and theoretical arguments while discussing the latest architecture projects as well as seminal cases.

Main issues are among others:
- modernity and its related issues of mass society, democracy, capitalist development and consumerism, mobility and migration
- constructions of identity and community under a global, multi-cultural condition
- the relative autonomy of the discipline vis-a-vis the project of the avant-garde, the role of the media, authorship and re-conceptualisations of perception and meaning
- the re-thinking of building processes and the interrelations between structure, cladding and ornament
- the multitude of interrelations between the everyday, public space and design practices

Key questions concern:
- where do architects stand and what can they do?
- which positions and practices are developed by architects?
- what strategies and approaches were and are relevant?","After completion of the course:

Mission Chair:
Complex Projects is a culture saturated with intensity, energized by an environment that demands a suspicion that is manifested through debate, rigor, humor, curiosity, and youthful optimism. Our expectations are not obtainable, however, the return is high for those who attempt the Odyssey like journey. Architecture is largely a practice of organizing information, of identifying and deploying patterns in our built environment.
Complex Projects has eliminated the antiquated and linear roles, which define the building process: Planning, Urban Design, and Architecture. Due to redefined complexities and parameters the designer must function simultaneously as a planner, community organizer, strategist, but most importantly architect. In essence, the Chair will attempt to find a theory for practice, one that address the true complexity in our post-modern environment, a new system, which the Chair together with its students, teachers, and staff, hope to define.
Complex Projects prepares its graduates to transcend and perhaps even ignore the scales, of these spatial and organizational patterns through the systematic development of critical thinking as well as strong vocational understanding of our profession. Complex Projects is structured to produce graduates able to think, negotiate, and collaborate through all scales and mediums of intervention.

The studio encourages students to develop experimental methods of analysis and design in order to obtain new design solutions.

The field of architecture holds a broad set of research and design methods, but also has the capacity to productively engage with approaches and perspectives from other fields that deal with the built environment such as litterature, arts, cinema, etc In contemporary architectural practice several architects (Steven Holl, Peter Zumthor, Bernard Tschumi, Rem Koolhaas) have used these productive encounters and exchanges with other fields to reorient architectural analysis and design.

This studio is dedicated to the exploration of these encounters and exchanges with methods from other disciplines. It focuses on the implementation of investigative and creative methods from these fields --such as mapping, codification, transcription, artistic drawing and modeling, etc.-- to site research and architectural design.

"AR9220","Urban Design and Engineering","In the technology course we will address two important issues that will influence our way of designing tremendously. The first concerns the flexibility of the plans we make. In the Harvard Design Magazine reader Urban Planning Today, Saunders (2006) defines the future role of governments as establishing intelligent and flexible guidelines, or incentives. These guidelines should not prescribe solutions or particular built forms, but should define principles or performance criteria that leave the designer free to be creative in solving design problems (Punter 2007: 507). The second issue concerns the effects of climate change and especially the changing balance in the hydrological cycle. We will study both simultaneously by investigating the dynamic relation between rising water levels, type of water barrier, type of housing and various density variables. Important is to understand the performance of a chosen model (combination of the above described aspects) in normal circumstances and in case of flooding. Based on the knowledge developed during the course, truly 'open' flexible plans can be made for areas that have to deal with a high risk of flooding. Flexibility and dynamics are thus key words for the approach we will take in the technology course.","The student:

"AR2AT020","Architecture Theory Design Studio","Over the past several decades it has become clear that the constitutive limits within the discipline of architecture have significantly expanded; while architecture discourse has, as well, sought to extend its own horizons. We believe that the 'problem of making' and the 'problem of thought' critically concerns both theoretical discourse and professional practice; and today, they have become intertwined in a form of what the Architecture Theory (AT) section simply refers to as Architecture Thinking (@AT).

The goal of the @AT studios - both theoretical and practical - is precisely to think, or rather to re-think, the challenges that design environments now face in this contemporary era of advanced technology, mass communication and distribution of information, and, most importantly, the politics of design culture and social transformation.

In envisioning the demands of an ethically concerned and critically conceived contemporary Architecture Thinking practice, it is necessary to address material and immaterial practices and production impacting both design dispositions and socio-cultural ethos. Thus, the research and the design projects in @AT address two primary areas of concept and action: [a] Geo-politics, Economics and Society and [b] Matter and Image in Architecture.","The student:

"AR1AE015-D2","Bucky Lab Design - CAD","The complexity of the architectural multi-actor design and building process combined with the integration of experience based knowledge in a highly conventionalized framework makes it a challenging environment to implement an effective communication of the design and design intent.

Today this communication is still primarily taking place in the form of two-dimensional shop drawings following strict conventions.
However, the description of a three dimensional object by a composite of two dimensional representations makes it prone to misinterpretation, gaps in information and errors in the drawings themselves.

An additional problem is the amount of drawings necessary to define the design. It can be enormous, which makes alterations of the drawings time consuming and necessitates a strict protocol for checking the drawings after implementing the alterations.
This problem is recognized by the industry and we can see a development of digital design support tools towards a more three dimensional digital design environment.
The unambiguous three-dimensional design representation contains more information than the 2D representation and can be used as an effective basis for communication and extracting data for analysis, simulation and digital manufacturing.
This concept of 3D design and development is entering more and more the realm of architecture. However the structure, in which the data can be integrated, simulated and altered has to facilitate flexibility to support the design process without becoming too much of a steering influence on the design process itself.
The digital design support tools which are available are numerous and diverse, however the properties of the tools will define their suitability for implementation in the design process.

In this course, we use an approach of concentrating the formal design data in a single 3 dimensional digital description of the design, a master model or virtual prototype
We consider the different design phases, which demand different functionality of the digital design support tools. In the concept design phase enhanced flexibility and speed in design are key criteria for an effective implementation of digital design support.
By applying the curve based modelling technique in Maya, in combination with the parametric environment, a powerful design environment is created where rapid generation of 3 dimensional design variations can be supported.
By modelling the geometry with NURBS the flexibility in design and communication of the design data is generated, making it possible to effectively use multiple digital design support tools during the design whole process.

In the design development phase, the advanced modelling tools of Rhino are used to accurately define the 3D digital design model.
The resulting 3D model will support enhanced insight into the design through its visual feedback and enables the designer to pre-empt potential assembly conflicts or investigate material and manufacturing solutions. This single 3D digital model is used as a basis for analysis and digital manufacturing.

The final phase consists of the conversion of the digital data for analysis and manufacturing and the digital manufacturing and rapid prototyping itself.
We will look at how the milling, laser cutting and 3D printing machines can be used and what kind of digital manufacturing techniques are available in the industry.","- The student has knowledge of parametric design.
- The student can create a 3d virtual prototype of the design for simulation, analysis and digital manufacturing and fabrication.

"AR1CP010","Complex Projects Design Studio","As introduction to Complex Projects, this studio has the ambition to make students familiar with the multiple aspects that define a building. Whereas the whole chair creates recognition of the increasingly more complicated development of projects, the Anatomy of a Landmark assignment aims for developing skills in the scientific method of analysis and synthesis. Via anatomical dissection, students learn to identify soft and hard aspects of a building while placing them in the bigger frame of the total composition of the building and its context.
The studio, via dissection of an existing Landmark, will expose the basic elements that define a building. The resulting data will be organized into a comprehensive research tool, which will be used to develop a position to the Landmark and a new individual design for it. The seminar AR1CP040 (Anatomy of a Landmark) is fully integrated with the studio.

Site: Madrid

Mission Chair:
Complex Projects is a culture saturated with intensity, energized by an environment that demands a suspicion that is manifested through debate, rigor, humor, curiosity, and youthful optimism. Our expectations are not obtainable, however, the return is high for those who attempt the Odyssey like journey. Architecture is largely a practice of organizing information, of identifying and deploying patterns in our built environment.
Complex Projects has eliminated the antiquated and linear roles, which define the building process: Planning, Urban Design, and Architecture. Due to redefined complexities and parameters the designer must function simultaneously as a planner, community organizer, strategist, but most importantly architect. In essence, the Chair will attempt to find a theory for practice, one that address the true complexity in our post-modern environment, a new system, which the Chair together with its students, teachers, and staff, hope to define.
Complex Projects prepares its graduates to transcend and perhaps even ignore the scales, of these spatial and organizational patterns through the systematic development of critical thinking as well as strong vocational understanding of our profession. Complex Projects is structured to produce graduates able to think, negotiate, and collaborate through all scales and mediums of intervention.
A nonlinear trajectory of integrated design studios and seminars will expose the multiple layers that define complex projects. Employing forensics, analysis, and documentation, one will develop a methodology to separate and examine the elements, which define the layers.","Upon completion of the MSc1, 2, 3 & 4 studio trajectory the student:

"AR1AE015-D1","Bucky Lab Design - Design","Conceptual architectural design is often, apart from tactile or visual aspects, not in any way materialized, while Building Technology specifically focuses on the materialization of architectural concepts. Bucky Lab Design as the first semester course of Building Technology emphasizes the reciprocal relationship between design, material properties and production techniques. For this reason the semester is directed to the elaboration of technical aspects of an, by students generated, architectural concept. Methodically 'design by research' is the key element in this course with the deliberate exception of the material prototyping with the hands on confrontation of students with material and production techniques in realizing his or her own design. Deliberate, because most designers do not easily come down from the heaven of drawings to the hell of realization.

Bucky Lab Design considers the design of a technically innovative building construction or facade concept ('scenario') from the conceptual phase all the way to the finaldesign, during which all aspects of the construction are taken into account.
Students use computers to model / test aspects of the design, structural mechanics as well as of the properties of materials and production techniques of a yet-to-be-realised building facade.

"GEO1007","Geoweb Technology","Today professionals and laymen alike have access to geo-data through the internet. Using a smart phone or tablet connected to broadband internet one can virtually fly-through a city and view buildings, underground constructions and proposed designs from any viewing angle, even augmented reality. The internet also strengthens the communication between government and citizens, who can comment on the designs, fill in questionnaires and vote, and in this way (local) government may increase public participation in city planning and other public affairs. Access to geo web services should be fast and based on open standards such as OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium), ISO (International Organization for Standardization) and INSPIRE (European Spatial Data Infrastructure). The map interfaces should be user friendly while sufficient functionality should be available for carrying out analyses on the diverse datasets. A key tool when building geo web services is Geography Markup Language (GML) an exchange language for geo-data based on XML (eXtensible Markup Language), the standard language of the internet.
The course consists of three parts:
1. Principles, application, evaluation and integration of geo web services and the importance of using standards when building them. The standards involved start with general ICT standards like HTTP, XML and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol. Based on these general standards, geo standards and protocols can be build. Combining the geo standards and protocols results in a set of geo web services that more and more replace the traditional GIS tools. In addition to the international ISO TC211/OGC web services and protocols the European INSPIRE network services will be discussed and used. Increasingly the semantics of data in the framework of web services, and linked data, plays an important role.
Topics of interest: websystem server-client architecture, WMS/WFS/ server, desktop/browser/mobile clients (incl App development), web-based transaction processing, portrayal, query (filter encoding), tiling, metadata service, web processing service, vario-scale services.
2. Principles and applications of (real-time) Sensor Web. The components of Sensor Web will be ex-plained and (some of them) used: Observations & Measurements, Transducer Markup Language, Sensor Observation Service, Sensor Planning Service, Sensor Alert Service and the Web Notification Service.
3. Applying software tools for the visualization of 3D geo-data. Normally the first, and in many cases the most important, thing to do with (3D) geo-data is to visualize it. Nowadays data is delivered over the internet by means of web services. The standards, architecture and services for 3D geo-visualization, and the practical aspects of available (web) tools and how to use them will be ex-plored.","After the course the student is able to:

"AR0009","Design as Politics: We Care a Lot","The Netherlands is currently experiencing one of the biggest overhauls in its healthcare system of the postwar period, one that will reshape our cities and neighborhoods and the way we live for decades to come. The demolition, transformation and replacement of healthcare facilities will be the major opportunity for builders and designers to reinvent their profession and redefine their place in society. Whereas in the past 'housing' was the subject with which Dutch architecture acquired its international reputation as being modern, innovative and effective, it will now be 'health'.

The reason why this change in the way healthcare is being financed, planned, distributed and executed has such an impact on our cities, and is so relevant for architecture, lies in its past. The Netherlands has one of the most sophisticated and successful welfare states in Western Europe. The equal and finely grained distribution of healthcare facilities over our carefully planned neighborhoods and towns played a central role in it. Millions of Dutch people live in neighborhoods built between the fifties and the nineties, that were carefully planned around care homes, medical centers and local hospitals. These facilities played and continue to play a crucial role in the network of public places and community spaces of these neighborhoods and towns. Emptying out the care homes, closing down medical centers and bring the healthcare to peoples homes, instead of bringing people to care homes, does not just mean an enormous surge in vacant real estate in the middle of our communities; it means removing the social heart of these neighborhoods.

Precisely there lies an enormous challenge for architects: to redefine these buildings and places left behind by the transformation of the healthcare system as social centers, and to design new healthcare facilities that do not work as isolated institutions, but that can intensify the role of the neighborhood as a meeting place, a place of social integration and of course a place of innovation.

contemporary healthcare is not the same as it was in the nineteen seventies, nor is public space the same as it was back then when many of our neighborhoods and towns were built. Technology is no longer the domain of the specialists, but has become ubiquitous in the daily lives of each and every citizen, allowing him to navigate virtual and physical public spaces at will, also changing from a passive recipient of healthcare into an active consumer. With technology as an important tool, healthcare will be integrated into the daily workings of our communities much more intensively than before, with the new care homes also being social meeting places for the neighborhood, and the houses where people becoming hybrids between carpenters, workplaces and dwellings. These changes however are still largely policy and technology driven, but they demand a design perspective, in order for the urban buildings and public spaces to really fit with the way we will be leading our lives in the coming decades.

For this reason the Office of the Dutch State Architect, as asked the Faculty of Architecture and the Chair of Design as Politics, together with three of Hollands most innovative and adventurous young design firms, to develop new concepts for Healthcare in Three Dutch Cities. This Design studio will work parallel to a real design commission by the dutch state to the Chair and the three offices, meaning that the studio will be subject to all the pressures and all the opportunities of a real commission, with real clients in the real world.","After successful completion of this course the student has:

- Developed a better understanding of designing for a real client in a political context.

"AR2LA090","Heritage Landscapes","The course 'Heritage Landscapes' deals with historic qualities as a design challenges. The subject aims at developing a personal point of view on the cultural landscape as a crucial contextual factor of architecture, urban development and regional planning. Heritage can be an tangible and intangible inspiration for future transformations.
The subject consists of three components that are strongly interrelated:
1. The design project is the core of the subject and focuses on spatial intervention in a green monumental ensemble in a rural or urban setting (e.g. country estate, old park, landscape memorial or otherwise protected scenery. Previous projects were the transformation of two fortresses in the New Dutch Waterline and plans for Royal Palace Soestdijk. The aim of the studio is to make a well-elaborated, detailed design proposal that expresses the student's conceptual, stylistic and professional attitude towards landscape history and green cultural heritage. The design studio leads to a spatial plan on several levels of scale and abstraction.
2. A series of lectures by internal and external practitioners from private and public entities provide the necessary background for understanding landscape qualities, historical analysis, value assessment and redesign. After the lecture series students are requested to produce a short report with the comparative, visualized analysis of two recent redesign projects. This analytical work can be used as reference material for the design project.
3. The aim of the workshop is to gain design experience in a practical, real-life situation concerning a highly appreciated or officially protected landscape or site Students are invited to spend a few intensive days in a place somewhere in Netherlands or Europe and are asked to produce a consistent and relevant advice for a specific heritage project or ambition. Previous visits included Via Appia Park in Rome, DRU Industrial Park or Renkum estates in the Netherlands.

"AR3AT060","New Urban Questions or Minor Infractions","The New Urban Questions lecture series will explore contemporary concerns surrounding current debates emerging from the intersection of the discursive practices and the material practices, including architecture, urbanism and the spatial disciplines, critically interrogating the contemporary situation of urban environments as the locust of diverse epistemologies of space and matter. Each week expert guest speakers and researchers will introduce relevant themes departing from specific philosophical and theoretical positions and modes of inquiry, relating them to the architectural and urban practices and attitudes of the present either by means of the analysis of specific case studies, or through the development of sound theoretical argumentation. Ranging from investigations on the implications of 'new' philosophical and theoretical traditions such as pluralism, new vitalism and new materialism upon the practice and discourse of architecture, to questions that raise the significance of ethics, politics and agency within shifting geographies of power and knowledge, the lectures in this series address impending material questions at a time of paradigmatic global change.

2. Course Content
In our weekly lectures we will firstly contextualize these concerns by introducing and explaining the transformations undergone in the core understanding of the 'Urban Question' (Manuel Castells, 1968) as symptomatic of a deeper change of contemporary society, which began to take shape during the mid-1970s. The 'Condition of Postmodernity' (David Harvey, 1990) is defined by a rejection and reversal of modern tendencies and practices, and is accompanied by parallel changes in global capitalism, mainly a shift towards flexible accumulation and the consolidation of free market logics. Furthermore, one of the most important arguments Harvey makes in his book is that the concatenation of the multiple forces behind this shift have rendered obsolete the conventional notions of space and time as independent categories. He claims that we are now experiencing a 'time-space compression', something, which holds the potential to trigger tremendous transformations in ontological and epistemological domains. Following this discourse, we will see how the encroachment of 'late capitalism' has affected much more than the unequal distribution of wealth and power in politico-economic and spatial terms. It has also made necessary the rethinking of the composition of social and cultural institutions, the structures of feeling, the ideologies and the subjectivities of contemporary society in important ways. For the sake of brevity, we may assume that one of the most important changes is related to the introduction of notions of 'complexity'.
In this light, postmodernity as a contextual and historical umbrella, functions as a fertile ground to explain the emergence of theoretical, discursive and epistemological transformations, all of which have far-ranging consequences and implications for human thought, knowledge and existence. The postmodern turn is characterized as a moment when theory and philosophy experience a tremendous atomization. From the grand narratives of universalism and humanism typical of conventionally anthropocentric positions since the Enlightenment and before, and the reliance on binary logics, the theoretical landscape suddenly widens significantly to include all sorts of anti-essentialist, non-humanist, non-linear accounts of reality. While critical theory played a crucial role in this transition, today we begin to doubt whether trusted methodologies such as dialectics may to have run out of steam to explain and theorize these 'new' complex realities.
Our lecture series will deal with some of the theories and philosophical traditions based on pluralism, which arguably are better equipped to understand this paradigmatic shift in relation to material practices, including architecture, urbanism and the spatial disciplines.","The student:

"GEO1009","Geo-information Organisation and Legislation","In this course students will learn about the organisational and legal aspects relevant for developing a strategy for a geographic information infrastructure.
Many organisations, and increasingly also citizens, collect, process and disseminate geo-information (e.g., Google, TomTom, mapping agencies and cadastres). Some information serves a specific purpose, while other information acts as multipurpose or base information, which is the fundament of an information infrastructure. An adequate information infrastructure allows for information to be collected efficiently (collect it once, use it many times) and provides reliable information for effective use in decision-making processes at all levels in government, private sector, academia and among citizens. Legislation is a critical component that needs to be considered to determine whether information can be used for a certain purpose and shared with others.

The course consists of three parts:

1. Theoretical basis for the introduction, organisation and management of (geo-) information infrastructures. Aspects that will be addressed are stakeholders, co-ordination mechanisms and components of an information infrastructure, the affiliation with policy lines like electronic and efficient government.
2. Overview of legislation pivotal to developing geographic information infrastructures. Legal aspects applying to geo-information, such as intellectual property rights, privacy and access to government information legislation, constitute a major part of this course.
3. Practical application of the theory. Students are tasked to write a position paper on a SDI topic of their choice.","After this course the student is able to:
- recognize and anticipate upon relevant legal (especially privacy, copyright, database rights, freedom of information law, and data sharing legislation), and organisational issues evolving around the acquisition, processing, dissemination and use of (geographic) information

Thus Plato's various reflections on the image, and the model, the ideal, will be a crucial topic, and the argument for mimesis that ensued, both in Plato's work, and in Aristotle. For late antique evidence we will examine the consequences of philosophical research, mostly Stoical, for the practise of art, architecture, and reflections on image making. For medieval evidence we will look at the conception of religious art, and current research; a reading of Panofsky's work Gothic Art and Scholasticism will supplement this. For the Renaissance period we will look exclusively at Vasari.

The lectures will scrutinise the nature of image, text and reproduction for architectural practise, and its subsequent development in the Baroque, down to the end of the 18th century. For the 19th and 20th century, the relation between image, photography, cinema and architecture will be discussed using Walter Benjamin's late research's on Paris as Capital of the 20th century, in his analysis of technology and seeing for the development of modern architecture.","The student:
- possesses basic intellectual skills in reasoning, reflecting, and forming a judgment
- takes account of the temporal and social context; the student will understand that science and technology are not isolated, and always have a temporal and social context; and that methods have their origins; decisions have social consequences in time
- has appropriate knowledge of the history and theory of architecture and related art forms and the humanities
- will possess knowledge of the visual arts in so far as these can have a bearing on architectural design

"GEO1008","Geo Datasets and Quality","Geo datasets are essential for solving spatial-related problems. These problems may be the problems of individuals (what is the closest caf with wifi?) but may also concern problems of governmental organisations related to managing and planning of our intensively used environment (what is the best location for a new railway track?). The availability, interoperability and quality of geo datasets are key issues in projects where geo-data is needed to solve spatial-related problems. In addition, datasets of different data producers are very often heterogeneous with respect to file format, conceptual model, level-of-detail, semantic content etc. This should also be taken into account when performing analyses with geo datasets.
In this course students will learn how to find, access, assess and, when needed, harmonise geo datasets to use the data for spatial-related problems. In addition, they learn how to integrate different geo datasets to produce new information. To be able to assess the outcomes of spatial analyses based on data integration, the main methods to assess and describe geodata quality are presented, including the main error propagation methods. In case of data about natural (or otherwise continuous) phenomena (e.g. noise, temperature, rainfall) the inherent fuzziness of this kind of data asks for other methods than in the case of 'discrete' objects, such as buildings.

The course has a theoretical part and a practical part. In the practical part students do exercises and assignments in order to get hands-on experiences on using geo datasets for solving spatial related problems and on assessing the outcomes. One or two guest lectures will be scheduled to illustrate the concerning issues with examples from the field.

1. The availability of geo data and geo data integration. This part covers: (1) overview of available geo datasets and their sources, data content (data specifications), encoding of geo data, accessibility (use conditions), main applications; (2) techniques for combining spatial data from heterogeneous sources; (3) semantic translations between different datasets (i.e. from national to INSPIRE)
2. Quality issues of spatial data. This part covers: (1) causes and consequences of error; (2) assessing the quality of data sets; (3) fuzzy geographical objects and fuzzy classification (4) finite representation of numbers in computers (5) error propagation (analytical and Monte Carlo simulation).","The main objectives of this course are that students 1) know how to find geo datasets for use in spatial analyses; 2) know how to analyse the content and quality of geo data sets in order to assess their fitness-for-use and 3) value the output of spatial analyses
At the end of the course students will be able to:
 describe the quality aspects of geo datasets
 evaluate the content of a specific geo dataset based on its data specifications
 assess geo data based on data models and data specifications
 understand the aims and process of geo data harmonisation
 compare data models of different geo datasets and create transformation rules between them as step in the integration process
 know the process steps needed to integrate spatial data from heterogeneous sources in order to solve spatial related problems
 know how to cope with the inherent fuzziness of geo datasets
 apply the main error propagation methods to determine the quality of results of spatial analysis, given both the quality of the input data and how well the applied model represents reality","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=34705&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"AR0795","Ornamatics","In recent years, ornamentation has increasingly (once again) become a compositional issue in architectural design. At the same time, computer-aided modelling protocols - in combination with new production technologies - have contributed to wholly new ways of shaping building elements.
Some examples of new techniques, which have recently become very successful in building production and in architectural design education, are: 2D Laser cutting; 3D Rapid Prototyping; 2,5D and 3D Milling. Such new approaches not only create new opportunities for traditional production processes (including physical modelling), they also offer new perspectives for design and manufacturing on the level of architectural components and connections.
The course combines a focus on the opportunities for new forms of ornamentation, with the active utilisation of computer aided-modelling and manufacturing techniques. The course couples the analysis of historical and contemporary aesthetic paradigms with the opportunities and evolvements of a variety of 3D digital platforms.
This experimental exercise is closely related to the research program of Form Studies and Modelling Studies. The issue of Ornamentation involves study on the level of historical architecture styles and production techniques, finding / analysing / categorizing of typical examples, development of a critical view on aesthetics related to building components.

This studio is based on the idea of design as an activity of the piecing together and development of ideas (using knowledge and technique what can be taught) rather than design as the product of genius (which cannot be taught).
More specifically this MSc2 studio is concerned with a the mass and space of the urban fabric, in a way that the design must fit in its context, now and in the future both in scale and in its program.

With the use of a design project the student, in weekly increments and scales of design, becomes familiar with the design methods that are, in all circumstances, relevant for a good built environment. Because of the compact time schedule (10 weeks, full-time), we provide a very structured approach. The design is developed step by step, starting with town planning issues relating to the city block, and concluding with the design of a public part of the building. In order to achieve a useful, beautiful and lively building proposal, the results that we obtain from working on different scales must be integrated. During the design process we will use design tools that we will discover by analysing similar projects.

This course is a full-time design studio that will give 15 ECTS upon successful completion.

- The concept of the Delta Shelter may be interpreted liberally, whereby the emphasis should lie upon the physical manifestation and material expression of the object. In addition the concept may arouse connotations leading to a more conceptual approach towards the assignment. The interpretation of the design assignment is up to the student, but must be clearly underpinned and communicated.
- The design is developed and elaborated in a series of evocative models, which should provide insights into the design decisions taken. The impact of the design must be shown 'in situ' by means of graphic representations and physical models.

"AR0146","Infrastructure by Section","INFRASTRUCTURE BY SECTION
The Highway and the City

Infrastructure mediates between the typical design scales 'from the chair to the city.' Rather than belonging solely to architecture, engineering, planning, or landscape, the scale of the infrastructure carries its own specific set of design interests. For example, the typical plan fails to adequately represent infrastructure as a form of architecture. However the sections (in contrast to the historical privilege of the plan and the bird's-eye view) provide the potential to address the design issues more effectively. In addition, the abstract qualities of sections provide an opportunity for experiment.

The studio aims to investigate the topical sections as the crucial mode of articulation and definition in order to understand and design infrastructure as a conjunction of architecture, landscape, and engineering. The site of the experiment will be the ring roads of Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht. The studio concerns itself with the architecture of the section and proposes a design-brief specific to each of the three sites. The section will operate at all scales involved, from landscape to the articulation of street furniture. Special attention is given to the impact of technologies of the near future, including but not limited to self-driven vehicles, for the spatial organisation of the highway-section and the physical reality of the infrastructural thing. Every site results in a competition-entry level submission that will be delivered to the stakeholders for each site.

The studio is a joint initiative with the Delft Infrastructures & Mobility Initiative, and other partners, incl. the three municipalities concerned, benefiting from their financial support. The outcome of the studio will be published.","The student:

"AR0148","Landscape architecture ON site - being part of the Oerol festival","In this course an analysis, interpretation and design of the topography and spatial identity of a landscape is made. The given site and the theme of the festival are expressed in a landscape art project, which will be performed during the Oerol festival on the island of Terschelling.

In a fieldwork excursion, the context and identity of the place are discovered mainly by sensory perception, which is the starting point for further research and analysis in the atelier.

Students are asked to study distinctive and unique aspects of the landscape of Terschelling and to translate those in a design proposal.
These parts - experience of the place and results of the research - shape the base for a landscape art project, which puts specific aspects of the landscape on stage at the Oerol festival.

During the course guests with different backgrounds will join the design process. Students are encouraged to explore methods and techniques of other disciplines and incorporate them in their design process.
During the Oerol festival we will stay on Terschelling for 12 days and execute the project on site.","General objectives:
- enhancing synergy and inspiration, scientifically and socially
- positioning design as conceptual-creative process and strengthening its connection with society, engineering, research and education


Specific objectives:
- to acquire knowledge of the physical form of the Dutch landscape and research methods at the scales of the landscape
- to study, visualise and edit the topography and spatial identity of a landscape in the broadest sense

"AR0205","Form and Inspiration","The assignment is set up as a journey of discovery and development. The search starts off on the basis of inspirations (potentially coming from architecture, but possibly also from other disciplines such as painting, sculpture, music, cinema, nature or science) towards the evolvement of a personal statement in form, context and material, which is evocatively communicated, using graphical means and models.
In the context of this creative exploration, participants actively experiment with a variety of visualisation techniques, working two-dimensionally as well as three-dimensionally.
The central educational challenges of the Form & Inspiration course are:
- Furthering the intellectual understanding of architectural issues;
- Developing expressive communication and formal analysis skills;
- Creating evocative project presentations and exhibits.
These aspects are addressed and practiced in a series of targeted workshops, exercises and instructions and subsequently effectuated in individual spoken presentations accompanied by a project portfolio.
Aspects of study include:
- Conceptual, representational and analytical modelling (digital and particularly physical)
- Sketching, expressive collage- and design imaging, combining various materials;
- Graphic design and lay-out, diagrams and sketches, signs and symbols;
- Spoken and written text, static and dynamic use of pictures, sounds and music;
- Evocative personal presentation before the group of participants and tutors.
During the final Presentation sessions each student will put forward a concise project presentation, allowing for discussions concerning potential, content and delivery.
Project evaluations will be made on the basis of the individual study process and products.","Design study application aimed at the development of knowledge and understanding in the fields of design, materialisation, detailing, realisation and presentation.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=34689&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"AR0053","Metropolitan Solutions","The AMS Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions is a new ambitious scientific institute located in Amsterdam. In this institute science, education, government, business partners and societal organizations are working tightly together to create solutions for the complex challenges metropolitan regions like Amsterdam are facing; Now and in the future.
AMS Institute is centered on applied research and design and focuses on the strongholds 'circular city', 'vital city' and 'connected city', which are based on urban flows such as water, energy, waste, food, data and mobility, and the integration of these flows.

In this AMS based course an inter-disciplinary and multi-cultural group of students works together on an AMS themed issue in the Amsterdam metropolitan region commissioned by a client from the private or public sector. Based on the Terms of Reference received from the client, students develop a consultancy or project plan, including a problem field definition and analysis, a plan for data generation and analysis and a description of the envisaged output or design. An applied training in project management, data collection, observation & interview techniques, and interdisciplinary teamwork is offered. A few lectures are given providing students with additional background information to tackle the issue at play in their case. Every student is expected to contribute his / her own knowledge and expertise to the group assignment and to (individually) reflect on this.","After successful completion of this course students are expected to be able to:

"AR0052","Design Studio: Architecture and Urbanism Beyond Oil","Global economic networks and the flows of commodities and people associated with them have influenced local architectural styles, promoted the emergence of new building typologies, inspired architectural education, and facilitated the exchange of architectural concepts for many centuries. The focus of this studio will be to identify global landscapes of energy, to map and translate the findings into widely accessible visuals, and to develop an architectural, urban or landscape project that addresses these findings and proposes solutions.The studio will combine two seminars that explore Global Landscapes of Oil (Carola Hein) and the Oil Landscape of Rotterdam (Paul van der Laar) with an urban or architectural design project that re-envisions Rotterdam beyond oil.","Architectural and urban design are anchored in larger political, economic, social and cultural contexts. Students will learn how to place their design into the global context of oil as a commodity, the generator of financial flows, and as a mindset. They will do primary research on Rotterdam as a case study in collaboration with Paul van de Laar (Erasmus University/Director of the Rotterdam Museum). They will work in groups on a chosen location and develop a project that acknowledges the larger theoretical and methodological premises of the course and that takes into account the different disciplinary backgrounds of the participating students.

"AR0028","Bridge Design","Bridge Design; an integral approach through landscape, architecture and structure.

The design of bridges is a fascinating field of work. Whether it is a simple crossing or an intricate steel structure; a bridge appeals to the imagination. Bridges overcome barriers, create connections and bring people together who were thus far separated. Whether a bridge is part of an urban context or a landscape setting, bridges are symbols of culture that deserve the attention of good designers.

The attention for the aesthetic design of infrastructure is growing since the 90s. Bridges are no longer seen as mere functional objects. For a long time, the design of infrastructure works have been the sole domain of the engineer. Nowadays bridges, viaducts, tunnels, and even whole road designs have obtained a renewed interest from architects, landscape architects and urban planners. Yet the number of architects and landscape architects with a solid portfolio in this area is very limited. Engineering companies that specializes in bridge design lack the skills to make an aesthetical pleasing design that is firmly embedded in the context and forms part of a public space of high quality.

'Bridge Design' is an elective in MSc2 which aims for students in the master tracks of either Architecture, Urbanism, Landscape Architecture or Architectural Engineering + Technology, but also CiTG or ID students are welcome. The course focuses on the design of infrastructures such as a bridge or a series of infrastructures such as a route design. The design process stretches from the integration of the design in the urban or landscape context to the architectural engineering of the design. This course will possibly be integrated with a similar course at the faculty of CiTG.","The student gets familiarized with the design process of an infrastructural assignment.

"AR0034","On Site: Design Research in Emerging Contexts","MSc2 studio of the Chair of Architecture and Public Building focuses on the conditions where architecture operates at its very limits: the project of the city situated in global urbanization and emerging contexts. These conditions allow for an elaboration of formal manifestation of the architect's position both in its disciplinary context and also at its limits transgressing the boundaries of the discipline itself.

The MSc. 2 studio is set up with the approach 'From the Specific to the General,' It aims to initiate various design agendas from the specificities and/or exceptionalities of a particular material culture of a place arriving at a fully elaborated architectural design. The studios hinge around the specificities of the notion of 'public futures,' through which the students are confronted with singular aspects that permutate in different situations.

By elaborating on fundamental yet specific core issues and eventually defining individual design positions, we encourage the students to implement their research into design practice within the collective thematic specificities.","- the ability to design an architectural object that meets aesthetic as well as technical and functional requirements

"AR0067","Architecture & Urban Design","Interventions in the contemporary city need constantly to be grounded on sharp design approaches in order to respond adequately to the necessities of our times.

Nowadays we meet in public atria and do shopping in malls; we move along covered walkways and go from street to street by taking shortcuts through the buildings of a city block. All kinds of buildings hybridised and became multi-functional anchors in the city serving thousands of people daily. The railway stations of today are entangled with the urban tissue, airports have become cities, conference centres and world expos temporary change the urban composition, and museums are also leisure centres. In the recent decades, the amount and the proportion of public space within urban buildings has steadily increased, with much of it forming part of a larger interior and exterior pedestrian network. On the other hand the amount and size of public buildings within the urban context increased too, changing the way the contemporary city is constructed. However, still rarely designers approach the city as architecture or the building as urban design.

For these reasons there is nowadays a great need of identifying the available design tools in order to plan effective future interventions in our cities. Particularly in the case of existing urban environments, design approaches require a conscious understanding of urban design as well as an adequate knowledge of changes in building typologies.

In this design studio, architects and urban designers work together in the examination of the urban space as architectural space and the architectural space as urban space. In this experimental design project, students and staff are interested on one hand to the urban intervention in the built environment and its effect on architecture, and at the other hand to the architectural treatment of the city and its effect on urbanism.","The student:
- understands the interrelation of architectural and urban design, to evaluate and create proposals for strategic interventions, with regard to spatial-social patterns and the culture of the city.
- evaluates skills in architectural and urban design to create an elaborate design proposal in typological terms related to use, ownership and meaning.
- creates an elaborate design proposal on the egde/overlap of both professions, satisfying formal, technical and functional requirements, including materialisation.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=34674&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"AR0027","Smart infrastructure and mobility (IED)","General assignment

The main goal of the elective is to elaborate a critical analysis of metropolitan mobility issues in relation to issues of planning and the natural and man-made landscape.

The aim is to understand and act on aspects of metropolitan mobility, water management and urban design in a developing context, through research and the elaboration of a spatial design for a sub-system of the High Tiet river basin system in So Paulo, Brazil.

This assignment is done by critically analyzing the issues and trends at hand, understanding the wishes and demands from the stakeholders, the governance arrangements and proposing spatial interventions.

This course builds on the theme of the Sao Paulo Infrastructural Traffic and Water Ring. Locally known as the 'Rodoanel Mario Covas'- the Greater So Paulo Road Ring, and the 'Hidro-Anel', the Fluvial Waterway for the transport of goods of the Metropolitan Region of So Paulo.

The metropolitan area of So Paulo is comparable to the Randstad in terms of size and economic output, but has twice its population. The complexity of planning and designing for traffic and water resilience in a metropolis of a developing economy context poses important questions:

(a) how the planning and design of urban and landscape infrastructures could potentially improve the social, economic and ecological conditions of densely occupied areas;
(b) how mobility and water planning/governance could best support the transition towards livable and resilient territories and
(c) how the understanding of metropolitan governance structures can help designers and planners act in a more sensitive and informed manner, by taking real stakeholders and their concerns and objectives into account.
This course focuses on the interconnections between spatial planning, landscape design and regional design in a cross disciplinary way. There are three chairs of the Department of Urbanism involved: Environmental Technology and Design, Spatial Planning, Landscape Architecture), each catering for specific aspects of the project.

Specific assignment

To design spatial strategies for a flexible hydrological network ('more space for water') in a dense urbanised context using the public ground. The design has to address the following points: urban mobility, critical (water) flows, retrofitting of natural landscapes/ of the natural environment in an urban context, site specific spatial and topographical qualities, main actors and stakeholders involved, overall feasibility and scale-related instruments/solutions.

The case we are taking is the Hidro-Anel, Sao Paulo-Brazil. An excursion to the location is programmed, during the excursion we will hold a seminar with the local experts and stakeholders.

The students have to take in account that expenses are involved.","General learning objectives

In order to perform historically, aesthetically and technically compatible interventions on monuments architects should be aware of their historical value, the types and state of preservation of the materials and the used building techniques.
The aim of this course is to study and evaluate a historic building with respect to its historical and technical state (maintenance) and to be able to convey this information, including giving advice for the conservation of the building, into a well-conceived, complete and consistent report.
The course gives students the opportunity to deal with different, though clearly interrelated, subjects: building history, materials, assessment and evaluation of the state of preservation (damage) of a building, conservation techniques with the final aim of integrating each of these aspects in the decision making process.
The students will be assisted by instructors and different specialists through the different phases of the course.","At the end of the course the student will be able to:
- independently collect, analyze and critically evaluate literature sources, archive documents, and other sources (as e.g. interviews);
- produce a visual documentation of the building , including its state of conservation, by means of text, drawings and pictures; this implies that the student will be able to identify the type of materials and to define the type of damage referring to a given terminology - identify and estimate the value of the building and its components in technical, historic and aesthetical sense;
- recognize the presence of different building phases, transformations in design and use, and restorations that interested the building during time;
- formulate hypotheses on the damage processes affecting the building;
- suggest the most appropriate investigation methods to verify the hypotheses on the damage processes; this will be done on the basis of the knowledge on possibilities and limits of the different investigation techniques acquired during the course.
- make a diagnosis on the damage processes by combining and evaluating a large amount of (experimental and theoretical) information;
- give advice for maintenance/restoration of the building;
- give presentations and write reports using an appropriate technical language.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=34679&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"AR0021","Aqua Terra Urban Design (IED)","Focus

Main question that this course addresses is: how to make smart urban plans using the parameters of the natural system  linking in an efficient way the hydrological cycle, the soil and subsurface conditions, technology and urban development opportunities. The pressures of climate change, the energy transition, the financial crisis and the current standard for sustainability demands for 'smart' production of cities, reached by distributed agency between the stakeholders taking part in the fabrication of cities. Only together can they make urban plans that are 'smart' in balancing out the natural and human systems and make sensible choices in using the hydrological cycle, soil and subsurface conditions in relation to high-tech technology.

Since the Industrial Revolution urban development increasingly became dependent on technological interventions to improve the natural conditions of a building site. The development of technology into a perfect state adversely affects our attitude towards the natural system. It gave a solid foundation on which the natural system was considered controlled; called the 'maakbaarheid' principle. Urban development after World War II ignores natural conditions and prioritizes socio-economical needs. Civil engineers prepared the building sites in such a way that urban designers could realise any plan that answered to the socio-economical needs. The building of cities had become so complex that deduction and sectorial approach is applied to keep control.

In order to create an emerging path where synergy between the disciplines makes sure that technology becomes embedded in the design process, this course offers possibilities for both urban designers and civil engineers to get well acquainted with each other's discipline. This is achieved by collaborating with the course Technology and Practice Water Management in Urban Areas at (CT5510) that elaborates on the technology of building site preparation and will show the collaborative worlds of soil and water.

During this course we will address two important issues that influences your way of designing tremendously. The first concerns taking the technical perspective. This means that the boundaries set by the technical conditions of a site, that are for the larger part in the subsurface, are leading. The second issue is about the flexibility of the plans we make. In the Harvard Design Magazine reader Urban Planning Today, Saunders (2006) defines the future role of governments as establishing intelligent and flexible guidelines, or incentives. These guidelines should not prescribe solutions or particular built forms, but should define principles or performance criteria that leave the designer free to be creative in solving design problems.

Based on the knowledge developed during the course, truly 'open' flexible plans can be made that are based in the technical conditions of your site.","The goal of this course is that students will be able to:
 Formulate their design perspective that is based in a conceptual or theoretical framework.
 Identify and discuss the synergy between natural conditions and technological potential and possibilities in urban renewal.
 Identify and discuss the tension between public and private development in urban renewal.
 Apply methods concerning the appraisal of sustainable urban development.
 Be able to translate analyses into design.
 Demonstrate in a design the connection between the natural system and technical possibilities in urban renewal.
 Be able to translate the design into a formal plan.
 Perform trans disciplinary working","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=34668&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"AR0023","The New Town: from Welfare City to Neoliberal Utopia","This course is focused on the planning and (re)design of New Towns as well as their social, cultural, political and economic context.

New Towns are different from 'normal' organically grown cities. They are planned differently, their political origins differ and their urban culture is different. In this course, we examine new towns through the lens of historical context, political background, economic logic and sociology. Issues that will be tackled are: how can we understand New Towns as physical manifestations of their various backgrounds? What methods exist to research social, political and economical developments and tendencies in new cities and how can they be evaluated? What are the contemporary planning issues of the new cities of the 21st century? How can we conceptualize and explain these urban projects as part of the present global urbanization? And what are the issues and potentials of the old New Towns?

In this course we do not just try to enlighten you with knowledge about the development of new towns from different disciplinary viewpoints during the lectures, but we will also visit and research a specific location in order to explore the everyday realities of the new town. This year we will focus on Alamar, Cuba  a large urban area with mainly prefab apartment blocks, just east of the historic center of Havana. By now, Alamar has 90.000 inhabitants.&#8232; Largely unpopular because of the low quality of housing and services, the distance to the city center and the lack of public transport.
Now that Cuba is politically opening up to the rest of the world, new perspectives become possible. One of the first large projects seems to be the redevelopment of the old Havana harbor, because of a new port area that takes over large-scale transport activities. The challenge for Havana now is to transform their old harbor into a economically viable project, while maintaining its undisturbed historic urban fabric and combining these developments with new economic","New Towns are different from 'normal' organically grown cities. They are planned differently, their political origins differ and their urban culture is different.

 Explain how New Towns differ from organically grown cities and how their design models have evolved from 1900 until now.
 Describe what methods exist to research social, political and economical developments and tendencies in new cities.
 Analyze the physical manifestation of New Towns and relate this to the social-economic context in which they were planned.

"AR0012","Analytical Models","The Analytical Models course aims at furthering the understanding of architectural composition and perception, though thematic, analytical study, making active use of design visualisation and model-making techniques.
This precedent-based designerly study initiative addresses issues of the architectural composition and perception, on the basis of targeted designedly study and evaluation.
Aspects of study include:
- Development of study approaches for the benefit of precedent-based composition analysis;
- Explorative visualisation of architectural concepts and identification of design phenomena;
- Design-driven enquiry making use of various digital 3D modelling applications;
- Design-driven enquiry making use of physical scale modelling and graphic representation.
The course can be considered as an interactive learning environment and laboratory for thematic formal study. Previous themes of study have included the architectural oeuvres of Robert Venturi and Aldo van Eyck.
The exercise brings together ambitions of composition research (Breen) and evocative, analytical 3D modelling (van Borselen) with the didactic opportunities of tangible, physical modelling (Coumans).

"NB3010","Current topics in Nanobiology: Cancer Biology","The course 'Nanobiology of Cancer' (NoC; NB3010) is structured in two main sections.
1. In the first part, the so called 'hallmarks of cancer', i.e. the quintessential 6 features which characterize the cancer cell and distinguish it from its normal counterpart, will be discussed in detail and from different perspectives (i.e. genetics, molecular and cellular biology, immunology, physiology, etc.) and examples to provide the students a solid basis on what cancer is (you must know your enemy to be able to defeat it!). After each lecture (HC), time will be allocated for the students to review the topics presented and to answer specific questions provided by the lecturer (WC.1). This will be then followed by an interactive Q&A session where each question will be discussed in interactive fashion (WC.2). An electronic voting device will be used. The didactic material will mainly consist of the seminal paper by Doug Hanahan and Robert Weinberg 'The hallmarks of cancer', together with the slides relative to the lectures.

2. In the second part, the focus of the course will be on nano-technological applications in cancer research and in the clinic. The basic idea is to take advantage of nanotechnology to bring together rigorous and theoretical disciplines such as mathematics, physics and chemistry with more descriptive and applied ones such as cancer biology, genetics, engineering, and pharmacology.
Also in this case, lectures (HC) on nanotechnology/physics of cancer will be given followed by self-study and more interactive open sessions (WC).
The didactic material relative to this part will mainly consist of recent publications (mainly reviews but also primary research papers) from the scientific literature which the students will employ to search additional references to explore in depth more specific topics of interest which will form the subject of the written assignment. To this aim, each students will be asked to write a 5-6 pages essay (11 pt. font, 1.5 line spacing) in a mini-review format (Abstract, Introduction, Outcomes, Discussion). The written essay will be handed in on the day of the exam. The essay will account for 40% of the final grade.","At the end of course NB3010 the student will be able to:

A basic set of genes encoding components of molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in development are highly conserved among animal species. Yet, nature shows us an astonishing variety of animal forms This is based on gene duplication and mutation events, which generate opportunities for further modification and refinement of developmental schemes, resulting in new forms and functions, if the new phenotypes are successful under natural selection.

Evolution and diversification of animal forms occurs through changes in development. By studying developmental biology in an evolutionary context, we gain a much better understanding of the mechanisms at work in animal development. In this course, the students will learn about general aspects of development across the animal kingdom: from worms and flies to fish, birds, and mammals. It goes without saying that this approach also provides an illuminating picture of our own development.","The students will learn about developmental biology in an evolutionary context.

The course provides a basic introduction to quantum dynamics for nanobiology students. The students have been exposed to basic quantum ideas (particle-wave duality, atomic orbitals and shells, tunneling) in various courses in the first and second year. This course aims to put these ideas on more solid foundations.

The cornerstone of the course (and quantum mechanics) are the Schrdinger equation, its solutions (known as the wavefunctions), and the associated statistical interpretation. As the Schrdinger equation is a differential equation, and the wavefunctions are its eigenfunctions, this course combines what students have learned in their earlier physics and math courses. In explaining the periodic table and the mechanism behind photosynthesis, it also directly connects to the courses chemistry and physical biology of the cell.","At the completion of this course, the student will be able to:
- Solve the three-dimensional Schrdinger equations for a number of common potentials, including the spherical well and the hydrogen atom.

"NB3017","Quantum mechanics for Nanobiology 1","This description counts for part 1 (NB3017) and part 2 (NB3018) of Quantum mechanics for Nanobiology:

The course provides a basic introduction to quantum dynamics for nanobiology students. The students have been exposed to basic quantum ideas (particle-wave duality, atomic orbitals and shells, tunneling) in various courses in the first and second year. This course aims to put these ideas on more solid foundations. Building on those foundations, the students also learn about atomic emission and absorption spectra, the fundamental principle behind lasers, and properties of solids, especially conductors, semiconductors and isolators. The cornerstone of the course (and quantum mechanics) are the Schrdinger equation, its solutions (known as the wavefunctions), and the associated statistical interpretation. As the Schrdinger equation is a differential equation, and the wavefunctions are its eigenfunctions, this course combines what students have learned in their earlier physics and math courses. In explaining the periodic table and the mechanism behind photosynthesis, it also directly connects to the courses chemistry and physical biology of the cell.","At the completion of this course, the students will be able to:
- Indicate the difference between quantum and classical dynamics.
- Explain the concept of the quantum wave function and quantum operators, and perform mathematical operations with them.
- Solve the one-dimensional Schrdinger equations for a number of common potentials, including wells, barriers and the harmonic oscillator.
- Explain the idea behind the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and apply it to arbitrary operators.
- Explain the concept of spin, identify fermionic and bosonic particles, and apply the Pauli exclusion principle.
- Give an explanation of the periodic table.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=37126&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"NB1072","Physical Biology of the Cell","The cell is the basic unit of life. It has a self-contained information system that instructs to self-organize, replicate and respond to its environment. Many elements of cellular mechanism that make this work have been discovered, but still our knowlegde is far from complete. The complexity and variety of molecular instruments the cell uses is truly astounding, and a rich source for nanotechnological innovations. In this course the student will distinguish the main structures and processes that allow the cell to function in self maintainance, movement, division and death. The student learns how new molecular information is obtained and how to interfere with cellular processes at the molecular level. Several cellular processes can be described using mathematical and computer models, and the student will be trained to recognize this, construct models and evaluate them. The course requires active participation of the students, who will design, present and evaluate mathematical and computer models and experiments, both individually and in groups.

The course will assume knowledge of cellular biomolecules gained in the courses of Chemistry, Biomolecular Dynamics and Genetics and. It uses math skills aqcuired in the math course Analysis 1 and 2 and basic computer programming skills acquired during the Biomolecular Dynamics course. Modeling of aspects of cell movement will be done in coordination with the Biophysics course. This course is required for understanding the cellular basis of developmental (course Development) and evolutionary (courses Evolution 1 and 2) processes. The course provides necessary background information for cell imaging in Optics and Microscopy and gives natural contexts of current, developing and future nanotechnology applications (Introduction to Nanotechnology).

In 16 sessions, once (Part 1 / first year) or twice (Part 2 / second year) a week, we're going to look at cell biology from a new, if not revolutionary perspective. This is followed by an exam.

Each session runs 3 hours and is divided roughly into three parts:

30 minutes: Evaluation of previous session's assignments and/or in class graded assignments
1 hour: Lecture including surprise assignments
1 hour 30 minutes: Practical. The practical is an integral part of the session and should not be skipped or left early.

My goal again is the course to be enjoyable and that everyone should pass the exam the first time around.

To make this as easy as possible I'm implementing the In class points system that can earn you already grade 2.5 points (out of 10) before the exam has even started. The In class points system follows the rules and regulations of the exam committee. In principle there are no resits for the graded assignments or practicals.","Upon completion of this course the student will be able to:

Through CBA, the potential current and future gains and losses of a proposed policy are identified, and then converted into money units in order to make them comparable with policy alternatives; certain decision rules help to determine whether the project is desirable from society's standpoint. Because CBA evaluates policy and/or project proposals from the point of view of the public interest, the market prices used in CBA are corrected for possible market distortions or failure (for example, un-priced environmental damage). Nevertheless, the application of CBA is fraught with has difficulties and limitations that need to be taken into account. What rates of interest are appropriate for determination of present and future costs and benefits of a policy proposal? Why and how do the private benefits and costs of a policy proposal differ from the social benefits and costs? How can we express e.g. environmental damage, or human health and life risks, in money units? How can we adjust market prices to account for 'external effects'? How can we use alternative measures of welfare to identify the benefits and costs of a policy proposal? Such questions are addressed with the help of a variety of case-studies, including climate stabilization policy, large infrastructure projects or large events such as the Olympic Games.","At the end of this course, students will be able to:
* understand why CBA can be used to appraise projects with an objective to improve social welfare

"SPM5520","Engineering optimization in energy and industry","Problems of optimization are pervasive in the modern world, appearing in industrial and energy systems. The optimization theory, especially mathematical programming and control theory have many important applications in these areas and promise to have even wider usage in the future.
This course is intended as an introduction and servey of optimization techniques and their application to energy systems, including smart grids and industrial networks.","The goal of the course is to represent and to solve decision problems from the energy sector and industry as optimization problems.

"SPM4530","Agent Based Modeling of complex energy and industrial networks","Our human society consists of many intertwined Large Scale Socio-Technical Systems (LSSTS), such as infrastructures, industrial networks, the financial and legal systems etc. Environmental pressures created by these systems on Earth's carrying capacity are leading to exhaustion of natural resources, loss of habitats and biodiversity, and are causing a resource and climate crisis. To avoid this sustainability crisis, we urgently need to transform our production and consumption patterns. Given that we, as inhabitants of this planet, are part of a complex and integrated global system where and how should we begin this transformation? And how can we also ensure that our transformation efforts will lead to a sustainable world?

LSSTS and the ecosystems that they are embedded in are known to be Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). According to John Holland CAS are '...a dynamic network of many agents (which may represent cells, species, individuals, firms, nations) acting in parallel, constantly acting and reacting to what the other agents are doing. The control of a CAS tends to be highly dispersed and decentralized. If there is to be any coherent behavior in the system, it will have to to arise from competition and cooperation among the agents themselves. The overall behavior of the system is the result of a huge number of decisions made every moment' by many individual agents.

Understanding Complex Adaptive Systems requires tools that themselves are complex to create and understand. Shalizi defines Agent Based Modeling as 'An agent is a persistent thing which has some state we find worth representing, and which interacts with other agents, mutually modifying each others states. The components of an agent-based model are a collection of agents and their states, the rules governing the interactions of the agents and the environment within which they live.'

This course will explore the theory of CAS and their main properties. It will also teach you how to work with Agent Based Models in order to model and understand CAS. The follow up to this course is the Advanced course, part of the Simulation and Gaming Masterclass (SPM9555) will be a project to set up a model of a CAS you choose independently.","The two goal of the course are, first, to understand Complex Adaptive Systems theory and its relation to the socio-technical systems around us. Second goal is for the student to learn about the the basics of Agent Based Modeling.

More formally, there are 5 course goals:
1. Students should know the definitions of CAS properties, as listed in the course topics
2. Students should be able to identify relevant properties of a system and determine whether or not the system can be classified as CAS.
3. Students should be able to create a coherent description of a system from both top down and bottom up
4. Students should be able to understand, modify existing Agent Based Simulations of CAS in NetLogo, and be able to create simple models themselves.
5. Students should be able to reflect on the traditional engineering systems thinking from the CAS perspective and understand the implications of changing the traditional perspective.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35192&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"EE4585","Semiconductor Device Physics","In this lecture first the movement of charge carriers in doped semiconductors under the influence of generation, recombination, drift, and diffusion is discussed. This knowledge is applied to p-n junctions. The current through this junction can be described well by the drift-diffusion model. For a metal-semiconductor junction the model describing the current-voltage relation ship is based the thermionic emission.

The p-n junction is the base for the bipolar transistor. In the bipolar transistor the reverse current of one p-n junction (the base-collector junction) is controlled by the injection of charge carriers from a forward biased p-n junction (the emitter-base junction). Some characteristics, like the Early effect and current crowding, are discussed.

Also another transistor, the MOSFET, is discussed. This device is based on a MOS capacitor to which we will pay attention first. In this transistor the current is led via the source contact through a conductive channel in a semiconductor to the drain contact. The conductivity of the channel can be controlled by changing the bias on the gate contact. Characteristic for this device is that the current-voltage relationship is more linear in contrast to the bipolar transistor where it is exponential.

Following the discussion on ideal MOSFETs, we will then focus on non-ideal characteristics of MOSFETs, like channel-length modulation and short-channel effects. Additionally, we will also pay attention to threshold voltage modification by varying the dopant concentration and MOS scaling. A combination of an n-channel and p-channel MOSFET is used for CMOS devices that form the basis for current digital technology. The operation of a CMOS inverter will be explained.

The Science communication graduation project is a thesis project in which you integrate your knowledge of science communication (15 ec) with your thesis in the science and technology domain.

For example: A student focussed her Integrated product design thesis on the development of a water filter for rural Bangladesh. Her science communication thesis was aimed at formulating a communication strategy to create awareness of the arsenic problem and to interest the target group for the designed filter. She also developed a theoretical frame work to ground this strategy.

Most students start finding a thesis project in the context of the Science and technology master. If you would do so, the next stage will be to search for a science communication research question related to this thesis question. Your science communication supervisor will advise you in this process.

During the Science communication graduation project you will be supervised by two science communication staff members: one 'daily' supervisor and one supervisor who will assess your thesis work at three times during the process.

During the lectures, the various possible communication policy and strategy models will be considered. As a course participant you will link organizational strategy to communication strategy and you will learn how to use and consider terms such as 'reputation', 'integrated communication', 'brand' and 'identity'. On the basis of such theory you will be required to forge a link with actual practice by examining several particular cases.

Professionals in the field will be asked to explain how, in practice, the communication policy of their organisation can be shaped while also indicating where the main problem areas lie. In the process, the kinds of questions addressed will be: 'How can the complexity and uncertainty of goals and processes be reconciled?', 'How can policy and strategy be embedded in the organisation?', 'How can the ethical norms and values that fit in with the organisation be utilised?'

The ultimate goal will be to research one of the case study problems and then to draft recommendations on how to improve the existing science communication policy and/or strategy.

"ID4210","Product Understanding, Use and Experience","Human-product interaction deals with the way in which
we perceive, understand, use and experience products.
This interaction is substantiated by our sensory, cognitive
and motor systems. In order to understand how
we interact with products, knowledge of these systems
and how they limit, enable or facilitate interaction is essential.
Our knowledge and insights come mainly from
the human sciences. In this course, relevant knowledge
and insights will be addressed in a thematic approach.
Themes include: usecues, emotion, sound, cognitive
fixation, touch, safety and risk awareness, discomfort,
visual aesthetics, multimodal experience and inclusive
design.","The main objective of this course is to enable students
to learn the limits and potential of knowledge and insights

"ID4250","Project Exploring Interactions","In this project, the students analyse current interactions, generate starting points for innovative designs, and develop new design concepts for interactions. In three iterative cycles the students gather and apply knowledge about current and envisioned interactions. Through this they generate an increasingly refined design concept.

IDEATE - in the first cycle the students explore a chosen situation. They formulate a design direction and goal. They conduct research in order to understand current interactions in the chosen situation. They apply the knowledge gained in the development of an interaction vision. They develop design ideas and initially test them through sketching and rough modelling.
ITERATE - in the second cycle the students form a design concept and produce rough models for first evaluations of the interactions. They develop the concept iteratively through further small interventions and tests in context.
DEMONSTRATE - in the final cycle the students adjust the concept to facilitate the desired interactions. They produce a detailed experiential prototype and evaluate it with users in the context of use. Students evaluate the prototype(s) with respect to the design goal and interaction vision.
Throughout the project, students independently explore a broad range of techniques. Tutors as well as fellow students are supporting the student in their process.","By the end of the project students should be able to:

"ID4170","Advanced Concept Design","The course Advanced Concept Design (ACD) focuses on the conceptualization phase of the product design process in a real design project with a company. The course begins with a design challenge, co-created by the experts and the company, and finishes with a product concept, which is elaborated in a sense of usability, aesthetical quality/value, technical working principles & materialization and its cultural & societal impact. In order to cover all these aspects, the ACD course is built around different disciplines (area of expertise) featuring research to create opportunities for innovation with a strong applied focus on the Concept Design Project (CDP). The different areas of expertise involved in this course are:

 Applied Ergonomics Exploration (AEE)
 Design, Culture & Society (DCS)
 Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
 Product Communication and Presentation (PCP)

In these different areas of expertise, students will acquire specialized theoretical knowledge through lectures, assignments and workshops. Scheduled feedback moments include expert meetings and tests, to assess the competencies of the students in these areas. Further, it is expected that the students will apply the skills and knowledge gained in these areas in the Concept Design Project, which is the carrier of the course.

Concept Design Project (CDP)

The first period a design team existing of 5-6 students starts with deduction of the design challenge, exploring the company and performing design related research within the scope of the design challenge concerning the different areas of expertise. Students search for the so-called innovative concept drivers and therefore have to weigh and prioritize the collected information. This structuring process gives the students new insights about user needs, cultural & societal experience, and potential emerging technologies. This period will be finished with a personal design vision including the answers on what to design, for whom, and for which future scenario.

The second period is dedicated to translating this personal design vision into a feasible concept. The conceptualization process will encourage students to strive for innovative usage, a strong product identity, feasibility in terms of applied emerging technologies, and estimated economic benefit. There will also be several moments during CDP when domain related simulation techniques are implemented in the project in order to evaluate and elaborate preliminary and final design concepts. In this period, students will work individually.

Applied Ergonomics Exploration (AEE)

During the first period of AEE, an overview of state of the art of research methods as supportive tools in ergonomic product design will be presented in capita selecta, which covers the gathering of user-, usage- and contextual data and their analysis. Academic experts and guest speakers from industry will pass on this theoretical and practice based knowledge as well as experience to the students. Students have to prove their ability to adequately select and apply these methods such as user observation, interviews and questionnaires, for the benefit of the CDP's design challenge. This way, user insights and preferences in terms of (dis)comfort, safety, usability and experience will be identified and provide inspiration and essential knowledge for the ongoing CDP. At several moments throughout the second period of this design project, conceptual stimuli  like, sketches, scenarios, models, concepts or prototypes, will be evaluated by the intended user. These user evaluations add greatly to the development of design concepts and elaboration of the final concept design.
In addition, user representation tools such as expert appraisals, anthropometric databases and creation of cognitive models will be applied in this second period.","After completing the course Advanced Concept Design the students will be able:

Concept Design Project (CDP)

"ID4010","Design Theory and Methodology","The aim of this course is to help you to gain a deeper understanding 'of the principles, practices and procedures of design in a broad and general sense'. The course entails a reflective approach to the study of how designers think and behave when designing, what sort of problems they encounter, the use/misuse/non-use of design methods, the diverse social contexts they might work in. The course offers Design Theory and Methodology as a framework that integrates theoretical concepts from different knowledge fields (e.g. design, psychology, cognitive science, philosophy of science), all contributing to the process and thus to the creation of potential products, services and experiences. Lectures, discussions sessions and assignments help you to develop the ability to think critically about the design process and thus to improve your own processes.

You might already be acquainted with a few models of the design process and some popular design methods and theories. During this course we explore the theoretical and methodological foundation of designing in more depth, and look at current debates and practices. The course attempts to stimulate you into actively engaging with the subject through a number of assignments.

The course covers a number of essential topics on Design Methodology, for instance:
1. Design problems: What are design problems? Why is design different from other activities? What does it mean to design?
2. Designing: How do we go about designing? Why do we use (design) methods?
3. Creativity in design: What is creativity in design? What determines design creativity?
4. Teamwork: What constitutes a successful design team? How do design teams should look like? Why/how could team conflict be a good thing?
5. Expertise and reflection: How does one develop as a designer? What are the different stages one goes through? How do you reflect during the design process?","By the end of this course it is expected that you will be able to:

Learning Objective 1: Evaluate (reflecting retrospectively) about your own behaviour as designers when carrying out design activities, by identifying and discussing about the repercussions of key moments in your process.

Learning Objective 2: Apply design theory and methodology topics as a framework for evaluating design activity and behaviour in professional practice, and critically propose suggestions for 'best practice'.

Learning Objective 3: Critically argue about established and emerging methods/practices, models, and theories and updated empirical findings of designing, and establish pertinent links with contemporary industry cases.

Learning Objective 4: Identify relevant (to your own learning) design theory and methodology topics around which to formulate and analyse issues you want/need to learn from design practice.

Learning Objective 5: Identify and propose opportunities for developing strategies for communicating and advocating your process to clients and stakeholders.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35768&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"AR0896","Van Gezel tot Meester","Didactiek in ontwerpprojecten
In een stage (Bachelor eerste jaar) leer je onder supervisie het vak van ontwerpbegeleider; de ervaring en problemen die je opdoet in de stagegroep kun je terugkoppelen in de onderwijsgroep. In een parallel lopende cursus wordt onderzocht hoe studenten te begeleiden in het leren ontwerpen. De bijeenkomsten hebben hun eigen thematiek; er wordt geoefend, ervaringen worden uitgewisseld en steeds worden de thema's in een theoretisch kader samengevat.
De thema's zijn:
- leren kijken: observeren en interpreteren
- een complexe vaardigheid leren: wat is essentieel om een vaardigheid te leren
- het 'hoe' van een assistentie: de essentiele onderdelen in een assistentie en de balans tussen vragen stellen en uitleggen, sturen en zelf laten ontdekken
- wat bespreek je in een assistentie: waar bestaat een ontwerpproces uit? het expliciteren van concept, een onderzoekende houding en de inzet van stedenbouwkundige en architectonische middelen
- beoordelen, de relatie tussen leerdoelen, werkwijze en beoordelingscriteria.

Ontwerpvaardigheid en ontwerpproces
In een aantal ontwerpoefeningen wordt het ontwerpproces van concept tot detail expliciet onderzocht. Door het ontwerpproces enkele keren te doorlopen en specifiek te bestuderen wordt inzicht verkregen in meer algemene principes tijdens het ontwerpen en de eigen, individuele inbreng; ook valkuilen kunnen zo aan het licht komen.
Zoals een topsporter op onderdelen en het geheel traint om tot meesterschap te komen, zo kan een ontwerper ook zijn eigen ontwerpproces trainen. Door het kanaliseren van gewoontes en het bewust worden van essentiele ontwerpmomenten kom je tot meesterschap in het ontwerpproces.
Essentiele begrippen in het ontwerpproces zijn: thematiek of kwaliteiten, experimenteren of onderzoeken en keuzes maken, domeinen, beeldgeheugen of bibliotheek en vaktaal (schetsen en maquettes).","Upon completion of the MSc1, 2, 3 & 4 studio trajectory the student:

"4413UEINFY","Urban Environments and Infrastructures","With half of the world population living in urban areas and with the building sector as the largest industrial sector in the US and Europe, urban environments and their infrastructures (for transport, energy generation and supply, drinking water provision, waste water collection and treatment, and green infrastructures for biodiversity and liveability) make a significant contribution to sustainability problems, in terms of energy use, material extraction, waste production, land conversion, GHG emissions, etc.

In this course, urban environments and their infrastructures are approached from an ecosystems perspective. Framing urban areas as ecosystems makes it possible to model urban areas and distinguish the different subsystems from which they are made. Students will learn about three themes in urban areas, which significantly influence the sustainability performance of urban areas: energy, water and (construction) materials. In addition, they will understand why technical solutions for sustainable urban areas are difficult to implement; the decision-making power is scattered over a multitude of actors, which makes it difficult for all parties involved, including governments, to influence the sustainability of urban areas.

This course offers you the unique opportunity to acquire knowledge of sustainable urban areas from an engineering, a design and an institutional point of view. You will acquire knowledge of important sustainability effects of urban areas and of leading methods and tools to assess and address these problems at various spatial scales: ranging from the building level to the urban plan. Also you will be acquainted with the specific institutional context of the built environment and its influence on the innovation and implementation of sustainable technologies.","At the end of the course students will be able:

1. To explain the importance of urban areas and infrastructures and how Industrial Ecology and the underlying ecosystem approach will help to analyse and improve urban design.

2. To apply the ecosystem approach to urban areas and infrastructures by:
o analysing urban areas as composites of multiple subsystems that can be distinguished at multiple spatial levels;
o modelling these subsystem in terms of input, throughput and output;
o integrating these models into an urban design.

3. To evaluate urban areas and infrastructures for their sustainability performance, by:
o judging whether state of the art knowledge and technologies of the focal subsystems in this course (energy, water and materials) have been used;
o identifying the trade-offs and synergies between and within subsystems and spatial scales and judging how these trade-offs and synergies have been accommodated;
o arguing how the design of urban areas and their infrastructures can be improved/optimized;
o discuss how decision-making for urban areas influences the feasibility of the design.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=34997&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"4413FSDMCY","Fundamentals of Systems, Data, Models and Computational Thinking","A computer is a tool to amplify your brains and every modern scientist is expected to be able to use a computer in an appropriate manner.

For relatively small tasks, like writing a text, adding a few numbers or making a simple presentation, the usual business oriented packages are adequate. For analysing large datasets, comparing many files, modelling complicated systems or co-operating in a team, more sophisticated tools are needed. Moreover, scientific works demands that all methods and results should be reproducible, which implies the research should be clearly documented and should be open to external examination. This puts responsibility on the scientist to act professionally when working with computers. The Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff disaster illustrates the price of sloppiness.

A computer language is not only an interface to control the computer, it is also a unambiguous description of the data structures and algorithms applied in the research. In this course, you will learn to use the programming language Python for scientific work, especially for analysing and visualising datasets that are relevant for Industrial Ecology. You will need a laptop and Python, which is available for all operating systems. The Ipython shell is advised, but any Python version will do.","Students will know the basic concepts of data handling and will understand use of computer languages.

"CH3632","Chemistry and Physics of Solar Cells","The course deals with the working of various solar cell technologies. Traditional (first and second generation) solar cells are based on semiconductors that are prepared by physical methods (usually involving high temperature and/or high vacuum methods). However, various more recent solar cell technologies (so-called third generation solar cells) are prepared via chemical approaches. Examples are dye sensitised solar cells, organic solar cells, colloidal quantum-dot solar cells and perovskite solar cells. These new technologies have received a lot of attention since they can be produced much more cheaply and in some cases offer the prospect of increased efficiency.

In this course we will discuss the operation of solar cells in general and will pay particular attention to the chemistry of recent solar cell technologies and the related challenges and opportunities.

Understanding the operation of solar cells requires knowledge about the physics of semiconductors. Therefore the first part of the course will focus on the properties of semiconductors, following the book 'Semiconductor physics and devices'.

"MOT2910","MSc Thesis Project","Within this project, students must demonstrate their capacity for academic analysis, synthesis, design, reflection and written communication on a particular issue in the field of engineering and policy analysis.

The student can start the Master's Thesis Project after at least two members of the thesis committee have approved the (draft) project proposal.

The student starts with an orientation phase that will lead to a detailed Master Thesis Project Proposal. After 3 and before 5 weeks of orientation the student presents this Thesis Project Proposal to his/her graduation committee during a kick-off meeting. The Master Thesis Project Proposal should give information on the goal of the project, the main research/design question, a set of derived sub questions/goals that give meaning to the project, data to use/collect, methods planned to be used, and a detailed project planning. After a successful kick-off meeting the student may start with the actual execution of the Thesis Project. During the kick-off meeting, the kick-off form has to be filled in, signed by the members of the graduation committee and handed in at the service point.

During the project the student will work towards the results of the thesis project and a compilation of project documents that the student will use to write a thesis report. The thesis committee or the student may organize one or more mid-term meetings to guide the progress of the project.

When the project is almost finished a green-light meeting is held [green light meeting]. During this meeting the student can get a green light to organize his or her final thesis project defense. This means a formal approval from the administration for graduation office (100% of the courses completed except for the graduation project) and approval with respect to the contents of the work (compilation of project documents in which research questions are addressed, and a high level draft version of thesis report). The work should at least be sufficient to pass without any adjustment, but of course expected improvements on both thesis project results and the masters thesis report as suggested by the thesis committee should be considered to be incorporated.

The student finalizes the thesis project in respect to the agreements made during the green light meeting. During the final defense meeting the student gives a presentation to defend the final project results. If all results, including the defense and presentation, are sufficient the diploma and final grade for the thesis project as a whole will be handed out. Students are required to make the thesis report available in both paper and digital copy.

More detailed and essential information about the Master's Thesis Project can be found in the TPM Graduation Portal, where all administrative procedures and requirements for the master thesis project are presented.","The MoT Master's thesis project has the following four objectives:

"MOT1531","Business Process Management and Technology","Business processes are at the core of high-tech organizations and consist of a large number of activities aimed at creating value. In the digital age business processes are supported by, enabled through and changed by technology. Business processes are situated at the point where the business meets IT and where technology and customer needs are aligned. If they fail or do not adapt to the needs of customers the whole business might fail. Business Process Management (BPM) is necessary for ensuring that processes are operating in concert and that these processes are adaptable to changes in the overall environment of the firm.
In this course the relationship between strategy, technology and business processes will be illustrated, explained and discussed. Methods and tools for business process analysis and improvement will be presented, including a number of statistical and ICT-architecture methods. New solutions will be architected for technology organizations. The extent to which the nature of business processes is affected by contemporary technology constitutes the core of this course.

"MOT1451","Inter- and intra-organisational decision making","All organizations, big or small, public or private, national or international, take decisions on a daily basis. One would like to believe that such decisions - taken in and between organizations - are highly structured, well-planned and based on all the necessary information. In reality, information is often incomplete or contested by the multiple actors involved in decision making processes. Whether it is governments pushing through policies or companies trying to increase profits, rarely can a decision be made in isolation from competing interests, both within the organization and outside it. As a result, decisions often appear to be taken in a chaotic and ill-structured manner.

One of the primary purposes of this course is to make students realize that it is often impossible to reach decisions through rational problem solving and information processing. In many instances, carefully pre-conceived plans and hierarchically enforced decisions backfire. Even ministers or CEOs often cannot decide unilaterally but have to negotiate and make compromises. Decision making is characterized by permanent struggle and the exercise of both formal and informal power. In such situations, with many different actors that have a variety of interests yet are dependent on each other, rational problem solving is not only unattainable but also undesirable.

This course first of all introduces students to theoretical perspectives and models that help to describe how decisions are made in practice, i.e. what decision-makers really do, and explain why decisions are made in such a way, i.e. why decision makers actually do what they do. Beyond description and explanation, this course then acquaints students with how networks are structured and what strategies may be used in managing a variety of actors and interests. During the lectures students apply the theoretical perspectives and models to real-life examples of decision making. In parallel students analyze a case study in more depth, which evaluates past decision making processes to formulate recommendations to actors about future decision making processes. At the end of the course students are not only able to analyze decision making processes in and between organizations, but are also able to design (strategies for) decision making processes that enable change in a multi-actor context.","At the end of this course students will be able to:
- Understand and apply rational and political perspectives on decision making.
- Contrast the characteristics of networks with the characteristics of hierarchies, and recognize these in real life cases.
- Independently reconstruct and evaluate decision-making processes about complex problems in multi-actor settings, i.e. in networks and organizations.
- Recognize and design strategies for decision-making processes in networks and organizations.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35293&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"MOT1532","High Tech Marketing","In high-tech markets, firms are faced with relatively high levels of uncertainty related to dynamic changes in technologies and behavior of customers and competitors. To survive in such a dynamic environment and to market high-tech products and innovations successfully, companies have to innovate constantly and to design their marketing strategies carefully. Marketing high-tech products and innovations and competing in high-tech markets require a mastery of a diverse set of skills and capabilities of firms.

The aim of this course is to learn and understand the basic principles and concepts of marketing and their applications, in high-tech markets in particular. The course discusses main issues of high-tech marketing, such as: product development and innovation, pricing strategies, distribution strategies, advertising and promotion, customer behavior, marketing research methods, the use of Internet for marketing purposes, etc.

"MOT1435","Technology, Strategy and Entrepreneurship","Greater product and technology complexity and increased internationalization of innovation activities have increased costs and risks for innovators such that the boundaries of the firms have changed and are changing.

Specifically, we explain the 'typical' patterns of technological innovation in order to provide a foundation for the formulation of a technology strategy. Furthermore, we focus on identifying the reasons why most industries adopt a dominant design and why a particular firms' technology is adopted as the dominant design. We will examine the factors that affect the outcome of standards battles. These include e.g. timing of entry strategies, collaboration strategies, and appropriability strategies.

We will provide a basic background of entrepreneurship. Specifically, we will pay attention to networking strategies for new firms (entrepreneurs). How do these firms attempt to achieve success with their new technology, in a new market? As the boundaries of the firms are getting more transparent due to greater complexity of technical projects, it is required to decide whether to collaborate with external partners, and with whom. This can be a good option for entrepreneurial firms as they lack the necessary complementary assets to successfully commercialize a new technology. We will explore collaboration strategies for entrepreneurial firms.

Technological innovation is a much more uncertain activity for a firm than other activities. Strategic thinking and formulation require knowledge on the boundaries of the firm and the markets in which the firm operates, its value chain and its core competencies. Also, strategy formulation aims at controlling the external environment of the firm, which is characterized by uncertainties. A distinction can be made in changes in the external environment in time or by location. General Purpose Technologies affect strategy formulation in time and frugal or inclusive innovations by location. After formulating the sources and innovation strategies we will pay attention to the resources firms have for innovation processes and specific valuation techniques, like real options, conjoint analysis and data envelopment analysis."," After the course students are able to understand the theoretical background of technology strategy. The course provides students with a coherent framework to understand, to relate and to position a variety of strategy topics.

"MOT1524","Leadership and Technology Management","Leadership and management in the context of high technology firms is the key theme if this course. The core of successful management in technology-based environments is the recognition of the value of employees for organizational success. Selection, development and performance management of employees are core activities of personnel management. Such practices are no longer seen as tasks that are the responsibility of a separate personnel department, but they become part of top management's personnel strategy. Line managers are increasingly expected to play an active role in implementing management policies and practices. Leadership appears to be a critical determinant of organizational effectiveness whether we are discussing a football team, an army, a street gang or a multinational corporation. Leadership is the subject of intense academic research and debate and journalistic commentary. In this course we will highlight the critical roles of leadership on different levels for the success of technology-based companies.","At the end of this course, students are expected to competently:

"SL3012","Professionalization in SC and SE","In this course for all science education and science communication master-students we will focus on the similarities and differences between education and communication. Students will explore and elaborate the statement that education is formal communication and communication is informal education. Knowing, identifying and using similarities and differences will enhance your own and specific education and communication practice and reasoning. Some examples: Teaching might be strongly supported by communication strategies. The psychology of communication might enhance the learning processes in groups and/or individuals. Communication professionals on their turn could benefit from the way educational researchers and education professionals deal with the various basic attitudes of an audience towards new knowledge.
Through an integration assessment students learn from each other their specific theoretical knowledge. This course not only focusses on new theories and the broadening of your theoretical scope, but moreover makes you familiar with the power of professional feedback and getting used to learn from and questioning other domains. The latter is important for education and communication which are multidisciplinary by nature.","Students will be able to identify and explain similarities and differences between science communication and education.

"SL3021","The designing of education or communication products and processes","How to create a series of lessons, design a strategic science communication process on a certain technological subject and its according communication means? In the Bachelor's stage you will have already become acquainted with designing. It will be that experience in the field of technological design that will form the basis for this course on designing of communication and education products and processes. The central themes of this course will be: how to design, realise, implement and evaluate education and communication products and processes.

The issues dealt with will be problem analysis methods, systems theory, design methods and precisely how communication and education theories can be applied to the design process. In case of the latter, also creativity, experience and intuition are discussed and made explicit during lectures and assignments. These domains of knowledge are helpful in bridging the gap between theory and practice. And of course ethical and philosophical issues connected to innovations in science and technology will be taken into account of the design process.

The course's first period is considered a more theoretical part in which science education and science communication students work together , whereas the second period you will start working on your own education of communication design.
The first period combines education and communication. In the second period you will deepen and broaden either an education process and product or a communication process or product. An important aspect of this stage of the course will be the justifying of your choices.","By the end of this course you will have obtained:

"MOT1461","Financial Management","The course covers topics such as financial statement analysis, types of financing and investment decisions, and financial consequences of those decisions. While investment decisions involve spending money, financing decisions involve raising it. Important to highlight is that corporations finance their investments by borrowing, by retaining and reinvesting cash flow, and by selling additional shares of stock to the corporation's shareholders. Hence, there will be among others three broad financial questions discussed in the lectures. First, what investments should the corporation make? Second, how should it pay for those investments? Third, what plans can the firm make to ensure that it stays financially strong and healthy?","By the end of the course, students are expected to:
 Interpret financial statements
 Evaluate financial performance of companies
 Identify financial instruments and markets
 Examine choices of proper financing instruments
 Apply relevant techniques for evaluating risk and alternatives in investment projects","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35296&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"MOT1442","Social and Scientific Values","Part I: Scientific Values (Philosophy of Science and Decision Theory)
1. The role of values in science and technology: changing the world vs. describing and understanding the world. The contrast between descriptive claims or arguments vs. normative claims or arguments.

2. The role of reasoning in science. The strength and quality of arguments. The notion of (scientific) proof. The contrast between deductive vs. inductive or ampliative reasoning.

3. The difference between natural and social science. How humans differ from natural things and what this means for the scientific investigation of human behaviour. The contrast between explanatory vs. normative models of action and decision making.

4. The notions of rationality and optimization in action. Different forms of uncertainty and related regimes of decision making. Elementary managerial decision theory.

Part II: Social Values (Ethics)
1. Introduction and overview. Getting acquainted with the notions of responsibility and other ethical notions related to managing technology and (individuals working in) the organisations that develop, produce and control technology. Basic meta-ethical questions: is ethics relative and subjective or, alternatively, might there be moral truths or universal moral principles? What are the implications of answers to these questions for management of technology?

2. Introduction into the most important normative ethical theories: utilitarianism and deontology. Exploration how these theories (should) play a role in criticial reflection about management of technology.

3. Virtues, Intuitions and Emotions: alternative ethical theories, related to virtue ethics and contextualism. What role do intuitions and emotions play in our moral judgments? Are they subjective and unreliable? Or might they be sources of moral knowledge? How should managers of technology deal with their own intuitions and emotions and those of others? How can we argue about and based on conflicting intuitions and emotions?

4. Technological Risks. Risk, uncertainty and ignorance in technological and scientific knowledge. The gap between expert's and laypeople's risk perceptions. Emotions and risky technologies. When are technological risks acceptable, how should decisions about such issues be made, and by whom? What are the implications of this for responsible decision making and risk management? How can we manage and design technologies that are morally responsible? (Value Sensitive Design and Corporate Social Responsibility).","This module explores scientific and moral values in the management of technology. The module presents and discusses science and technology as practices involving a wide variety of judgements that are based on or express values. Values internal to science and technology are discussed in relation to the rationality of belief (e.g. scientific evidence) and action (e.g. decision making). Moral values are discussed through the notion of corporate social responsibility, by focusing on the ethical and social aspects and problems of technology and of professionals and managers active in the development, production and control of technology, and it explores possibilities for resolving, diminishing or preventing these problems.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35289&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"MOT1412","Technology Dynamics","Concepts of socio-technological change, and the drivers and barriers in the innovation change process, such as economic-, social-, or knowledge drivers will be the core of the course. The course focuses on the relation between society and technology including the way societal values such as sustainable development are affected by new technologies. In particular, it offers concepts, theories, and methods to incorporate these societal values into design processes in a responsible way. Moreover, we will look at the role of different stakeholders, i.e. universities, firms and government in innovation systems.

More specifically, the course addresses these issues as follows:

1) Theories on technological development and its relation with society will be presented, including technological determinism, social construction of technology, and quasi-evolutionary theory. These theories give rise to reflections on the possibility of technological forecasting and the necessity to attend societal values already in the innovation process itself.

2) Methods to integrate societal values into design processes will be presented, such as constructive technology assessment (CTA) and value sensitive design.

3) Innovation systems will be presented by discussing how innovative agents and knowledge infrastructure shape and drive innovation systems on the industry level as well as on the regional, national and global level. Using the so-called Triple-Helix approach we investigate university-industry-government linkages as well as the role of management and policy in this context.","At the end of the course the student is able to analyze dynamic processes of technological change from different methodological angles. Students are able to reflect on the societal implications of technological change and the challenges that society poses to technology and industry, and they have command over the methods and conceptual tools to integrate these societal challenges in innovation processes.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35295&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"WM0939TU","Engineering for sustainable development","The course provides students with a unique opportunity to explore the connection between engineering, the environment and society. Through the course students apply knowledge from the classroom to solve real-world problems and see first-hand how engineers are tackling the massive challenges of sustainable development.

Sustainable development is one of the biggest challenges our society is facing. Climate change, loss of biodiversity, pollution, water scarcity at some places and floods at others, scarcity of natural resources, population growth and the increasing gap between the rich and the poor are all issues that make sustainable development urgent. With sustainable development is meant development that is good for nature (e.g. biodiversity, environment), people (e.g. poverty reduction, welfare) and at the same time economically profitable (e.g. business model). Technology plays a vital role in transitions towards sustainable development, as it can help to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, et cetera. That means that, as an engineer, you will be able to play an important role in sustainable development. As sustainability problems cover different disciplinary fields at the same time and cannot be tackled by only one of them, an interdisciplinary approach is necessary. In addition, there needs to be more in place than just technology for innovations to become implemented widely. Innovations are embedded in so-called 'sociotechnical systems', i.e. systems of technological infrastructures, people and institutions (e.g. regulations). In order to understand how sustainable innovations come about, it is important to understand the wider sociotechnical system and how it may foster or hamper sustainability transitions.
This course offers reflection that you will need as an engineer working on sustainability issues. First, reflection on actual sociotechnical systems will be enhanced during lectures, site visits and discussions during the meetings. Central are sociotechnical scenarios and societal aspects of technology for sustainability. Second, students work in interdisciplinary teams on a particular sustainability transition. Each team will design pathways towards a more sustainable future for a particular (selected) project. Third, students will reflect on their own role, as an engineer, in sustainable development in an individual report.","During the course students will:
- Experience complexity, tensions and dilemmas that come with sustainable practices and required interdisciplinary efforts;
- Consider their role as an engineer with regard to sustainable development and reflect on personal educational objectives, professional values, ethics and beliefs.
- Analyse (im)possibilities and design pathways of transitions to sustainable futures of sociotechnical systems.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35230&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"WI4211","Advanced Topics in Analysis","This course gives an introduction into real harmonic analysis. Harmonic analysis has its origin in Fourier's work on the heat equation and the development of Fourier analysis on the torus. The theory then moved to the real line, higher dimensional Euclidean spaces and more general geometric settings, in order to treat partial differential equations in such contexts. Nowadays, methods from real harmonic analysis are used in a large variety of problems, coming from partial differential equations, geometric measure theory, functional analysis etc.

In this course, we will develop important concepts of real harmonic analysis, starting with fundamental tools such as covering lemmas, maximal functions and basic interpolation theory. We will then concentrate on the theory of singular integral operators, a class of operators that plays an important role in the treatment of boundary value problems. Proiminent examples are the Hilbert transform and the Riesz transforms. We will establish their boundedness in the Lebesgue spaces Lp. The final goal of the course is to prove the by now famous 'T(1) Theorem', which characterises the L2 boundedness of singular integral operators.","Knowledge of covering lemmas, maximal functions, basic interpolation theory

"ET4389","Complex Networks from Nature to Man-made Networks","This course will provide two variants for the last 3 lectures, one focusing on complex network/system performance analysis and design (suggested for EE students) and one focusing on networked data analysis (suggested for Computer Science students)

EE variant: This course introduces the basic tools/metrics to characterize properties of large networks, methods to analyze the dynamic processes such as epidemic/information spread, percolation and opinion dynamics on networks. These tools are applied to understand the effect of network on the function of a system, for example, (a) to evaluate the robustness of infrastructures such as metro transportation networks against failures; (b) to estimate the epidemics/virus spread on social networks/Internet; (c) to explore how properties of brain networks may predict brain functioning like IQ. Such fundamental understanding of the role of a network in its functioning will be further used in the design of a robust possibly interconnected networks against e.g. failures and epidemics.

CS variant: Big Data is mostly obtained from features of components and the interactions among components in large complex systems. Examples are (1) end user features and interactions in both online and real-world social networks like Twitter, (2) data from content sharing platforms such as YouTube (3) physiological data of the brain and (4) stock prices in economic systems. Such dataset is networked in nature i.e. the data of the system components or interactions are (cor)related to each other. This course introduces the basic methodologies to analyze, interpret, model, and possibly to predict such Networked Data, combining advances from network science, modeling of dynamic processes and statistical physics, beyond curve fitting and machine learning. These methods will be applied to diverse real-world datasets such as LinkedIn, Youtube, recommender systems, the brain etc.","EE variant:
After this course, students could represent/abstract a complex system such as a brain or a communication system as a complex network, understand the basic methods to analyze properties of networks and dynamic processes on the networks, design robust networks against e.g. failures and epidemics and be able to apply them to real-world complex systems.

CS variant:
After this course, students could construct the network based on the dataset, characterize and model the network, model the data via e.g. dynamic processes (e.g. viral information spreading) on networks, in order to possibly predicate the future e.g. the popularity of a product, news, or a social network and the prevalence of a disease/computer virus.

"AP3911","Work Placement (Internship)","You will be working in an Applied Physics related organization full-time for a period of 3 months. Your Master Applied Physics knowledge is necessary for the project.

The industrial internship is guided by an internal (TU Delft) and an external (company) supervisor. The mark for the internship is awarded by these two supervisors. The mark is based on a series of criteria, including an individual report of the student, in which the experiences concerning the main goals, including the experience in the working environment are discussed.

During the industrial internship you are expected to get to know the organization. To do so, you need to start gathering information about the organization of your choice prior to the start and make a list of questions you would like to have answered. During the internship you need to make time to get acquainted with other departments within the organization and interview, for example, a number of people in different parts of the organization.

IMPORTANT:

 It is desirable for the internship to have a Applied Physics content. However, in some cases it may be acceptable if this component is lacking, provided that the work requires problem solving or design skills for a physicist
 The criteria formulated above do not exclude activities in a startup company (maybe initiated by the student) to be accepted as internships. The criterion is that there should be an internship supervisor with sufficiently strong involvement to be able to act as such.
 The internship is in principle intended as a way for students to broaden their awareness of working environments outside academia. For students with particular ambition and skill to pursue a career in science, an internship in an academic environment (not a Dutch university or FOM institute) may however be acceptable.

The student is responsible for finding an internship position. The Internship Office TNW only has an assisting, coordinating and administrative role.
We therefore advice students to start looking for an internship well in advance:
 International students are advised to start the orientation process during the first year of their Master
 Dutch students are advised to start the orientation process at least 6 months in advance if planning to stay in the Netherlands, and at least 9 months if planning to go abroad.","The goal of the internship is:
 To become familiar with a professional working environment for a physicist
 To use academic knowledge and skills, acquired in the degree course, to solve problems or be active in design related to Applied Physics, in a professional working environment.

In particular we will study ways to solve this model numerically where we take a practial approach and build the numerical tools ourselves. Here, the focus is on state-of-the-art finite volume/element techniques.

During the lectures the necessary theory will be outlined and during homework sessions the theory and methodology is implemented into working methods. After a few weeks, practical radiation problems can already be tackled. Finally, during the practical examnination, a radiative transport problem needs to be solved by the student from nuclear reactor engineering or from another discipline that is of interest to the student.

"AP3202","Topology in Condensed Matter","The idea behind topological systems is simple: if there exists a quantity, which cannot change in an insulating system where all the particles are localized, then the system must become conducting and obtain propagating particles, when this quantity (called 'topological invariant') finally changes.

Frequently, the edges of such topological materials have properties that are impossible to achieve otherwise owing to the so-called 'bulk-edge correspondence'. It guarantees the existence of protected states at the edge and their robustness against anything that happens at the boundary.

The practical applications of this principle are quite profound, and already within the last eight years they have lead to prediction and discovery of a vast range of new materials with exotic properties that were considered to be impossible before.

Our central focus will be these very exciting developments with special attention to the most active research topics in topological condensed matter: namely the theory of topological insulators and superconductors following from the 'grand ten symmetry classes' as well as topological quantum computation and Majoranas.

We will complete this general picture with a discussion of some of the other ramifications of topology in various areas of condensed matter such as photonic and mechanical systems, topological quantum walks, topology in fractionalized systems, driven or dissipative systems.","Learn about the variety of subtopics in topological materials, their relation to each other and to the general principles.

The objective of the competition is to design and build an engineered biological system using DNA technologies over the course of the summer. The engineered systems (mostly E.coli) will be constructed from standard biological parts (plasmids), called BioBricks in the iGEM community.

During the course of the summer you will design your experiments, construct parts (plasmids) and validate the constructs using (new) characterization assays. Besides the molecular work an important aspect of iGEM is modeling. Comparable to engineering approaches, the parts' function and interaction are modeled to predict their behavior and foster the understanding of relevant characteristics. Thereby the modeling assists the design and construction of improved parts and experimental methods.

Alongside the scientific work, you will be cooperating with scientific and non-scientific communities to promote and communicate your project. The project will be publicized through public relations efforts, social media, and the team's own wiki page. Funding for the team will be raised by the students from university groups and local industries. The project will also have a policy and practice component, in which the social, legal, and ethical issues of the project are considered, through considerations of the possible risks of the project, interviews with relevant end-users and affected community members, and designing of appropriate safety and deployment mechanisms.

The team will be advised by several experienced faculty members, technicians, and graduate students.

"AP3311 D","Neutrons, X-Rays and Positrons for Studying Microscopic Structures and Dynamics","The microscopic structure and dynamics of condensed matter in physics, chemistry and biology is obtained by a wide variety of scattering techniques. Structures are determined on length scales ranging from 10-11 to 10-5 m, dynamics on time scales from 10-14 to 10-6 s. In this course we discuss the different neutron, X-ray and positron techniques, illustrated by a broad range of scientific and technological applications.

After a general introduction an overview is given of the scattering theory, both for neutrons and X-rays. Then the different techniques will discussed in more detail. Diffraction (either by X-rays or neutrons) yields information about the structure of single crystals, powders, and liquids. Small-angle scattering (SAXS and SANS) reveals the shape and arrangement of colloidal systems, micelles or polymers in a solvent. Reflectometry is used to find the composition of layered structures like proteins adsorbed at surfaces or magnetic layers in recording materials. Polarized neutrons are used in two different ways. First, for determining magnetic structures and dynamics. Second, as a special technique (spin-echo) to study the larger length scales and time scales (polymer dynamics). Inelastic scattering measures phonons in crystals, diffusion in liquids and the vibrational spectrum of molecules. Neutron sources (fission and spallation), X-ray sources (from X-ray tube, via synchrotron to XFEL) and instrumentation will be an integral part of this course.

An introduction to positron annihilation (PA) will be given. Positron annihilation lifetime, Doppler Broadening techniques are particularly suited for the detection and characterisation of (open volume) defects such as vacancies, vacancy clusters and voids in e.g. metals, alloys, semiconductors and polymers. The main application of the Angular Correlation of Annihilation Radiation (ACAR) technique is the study of the electronic structure of solids, and that of defects, precipitates and nanocrystals.

A visit to the neutron and positron experimental facilities at the Reactor Institute Delft will be part of the course.","Obtaining general knowledge of the theoretical

"WB1427-13","Advanced Fluid Dynamics A","In this course the fundamental and mathematical principles of fluid mechanics are treated. Point of departure is the conservation equations for mass and momentum. Based on these equations the equations of motion for a incompressible flow are derived. In order to close the equation of conservation of momentum a relationship must be prescribed between the stress tensor and the deformation-rate tensor leading to the constitutive equation for a Newtonian fluid. The result is known as the Navier-Stokes equations. First these equations are simplified for the case of an inviscid fluid which are known as the Euler equations. The solution of these equations for the case of a irrotational flow leads to a treatment of potential flow theory and the law of Bernoulli. This theory and law are applied to the flow around a sphere and around a cylinder. The flow around a cylinder is two dimensional and it is shown that in this case potential flow theory can be described in terms of complex function theory. This theory is applied to the flow around a cylinder in combination with a line vortex and by means of conformal transformations a relationship is derived with the lift force on a airfoil. In the remaining of the course the full Navier-Stokes equations, i.e. including the viscosity terms, are considered and the Reynolds number is defined. The effect of viscosity is coupled to dissipation of energy and diffusion of vorticity. As example of a very viscous flow, we discuss the Stokes flow in particular the flow around a sphere. For large Reynolds numbers the boundary-layer theory is derived and the Blasius solution for the boundary layer over a flat plate is discussed.

"WM0201TU-Eng","Technical Writing","This course is geared to two groups of writers: engineers who need to write technical reports and scientists who need to write scientific articles.

Modern engineers are required to possess excellent communication skills. Not only do they need to know their business, they need to know how to communicate this business to other experts, decision makers and implementers. They need to be able to write accessible technical reports and proposals and to hit the correct tone in professional correspondence.

The goal of scientific research is publication. Scientists are rarely measured by their knowledge of science; instead they are measured, and become known (or remain unknown) by their publications. Scientific articles need to be well structured to allow for efficient reading and accessible for the scientific community. They should also be written in a professional style, convincing, effective and without language errors.

Both groups will benefit from this course, which focuses on both the quality of the text and on the writing process itself. The following subjects will be dealt with:

a systematic approach to writing
requirements to technical reports and scientific papers and their components
structuring texts on several levels
writing convincingly
writing 'proper and appropriate' language
referencing
Seven lessons will be used for instruction, feedback and practice. Students will be required to hand in several assignments while they are working on the technical or scientific report that needs to be written to complete the course.

"WB1424ATU","Turbulence A","In this course an introduction is given to the theory of turbulence. The course starts with the treatment of the properties of turbulence and the distinction between laminar and turbulent flows. This is followed by the treatment of linear stability theory applied to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, the inflection criterion of Rayleigh and the Orr-Sommerfeld equation. Next follows a phenomenological treatment of turbulence, a discussion of Richardson's energy cascade and the Kolmogorov 1941 theory on the micro and macrostructure of turbulence. The statistical treament of stochastic processes is discussed and the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are derived. This leads to a discussion of the closure problem for the Reynolds stress and the introduction of the gradient-diffusion hypothesis and K-theory for the turbulent viscosity. The RANS equations are then applied to boundary-free shear flows such as jets and wakes. For jets and wakes an analytical expression for the mean velocity profile can be derived based on an order-of-magnitude analysis and the assumption of self-similarity. Next the RANS equations are applied to wall-bounded shear flows such as channel and pipe flows. Approximate analytical expressions are derived for the mean velocity in the inner and the outer layer. The logarithmic law is derived for the mean velocity in the overlap region. The influence of wall roughness and a streamwise pressure gradient on wall-bounded turbulence is discussed. The transport equations are derived for the mean and the turbulent kinetic energy and related to Richardson's energy cascade. The effect of buoyancy is explained by means of the flux Richardson number and the Oboukhov length. Several popular models are discussed for the turbulent viscosity such as the k-epsilon model. The strengths and weaknesses of these models are demonstrated by means of simulations with a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) package. The concept of Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is explained. Finally, an introduction is given to energy spectra and correlations of turbulent flows. The -5/3 law for the spectrum of turbulence in the inertial subrange is derived.","At the end of this course the student is able to:
1. describe the characteristic differences between laminar and turbulent flows.
2. determine the stability of simple basic flows by means of a linear stability analysis.

"AE4S06P","Spacecraft Mechatronics Exercise","In many technical systems that interact with their environment the 'intelligence' behind this comes from a microcontroller. Even very simple systems with basic interaction features (like a toaster) tend to rely on a microcontroller to do the job. Also more complex systems like nano-satellites, sounding rockets, UAV's and other robotic systems tend to rely heavily on microcontrollers. So for any professional engineer that designs systems that interact with their environment it seems inevitable that microcontrollers come into view. Fortunately the use of microcontrollers is so simple and so many tools are available that is can be quite easy to program a controller for a 'quick and dirty' test of a prototype system.
This lab is intended to introduce microncontrollers in a practical project where the students use them to interface with COTS sensors and actuators.

It is very well possible that the board the students has now become acquinted with, perfectly suits the needs in larger future projects (like Stratos or Delfi)so there is no need to get used to a new board which will save a lot of time, which is good because the microcontroller is seldom the main focus of a project.

"AE4320","System Identification of Aerospace Vehicles","Accurate aerodynamic models play a crucial role in the design and operation of flight simulators and flight control
systems. The creation of accurate aerodynamic models from CFD, wind tunnel, and flight test data has historically
been a highly challenging task. This is a direct result of the nonlinear nature of aircraft (aero)dynamics and the
fact that not all aircraft states can be measured directly. As a consequence, the aerospace vehicle parameter
identification problem constitutes a joint parameter-state estimation problem. It is the aim of this course to
provide the student with a complete overview of the system identification cycle as it is currently applied to
aerospace systems, and to introduce the student to the current state of the art in the field of aerodynamic model
identification.

The course consists of 7 parts covering the entire system identification cycle. In the first part of the course, the
process of data acquisition using on-board sensors including accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS and various air data
sensors is discussed. It will be demonstrated that measurements made by real-world sensors are contaminated with
noise, and are sometimes biased. Additionally, some aircraft states, like the true angle of attack, cannot be
measured directly and must be reconstructed by combining sensor measurements.

The second part of the course introduces the concept of state estimation in which prior physical knowledge of the
system is used in a Kalman filter (KF) to estimate the true aircraft states from the measured states. Next to the
ordinary Kalman filter, the Extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the Iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) will be
introduced.

In the third part of the course various methods for the estimation of model parameters will be discussed. It will be
shown how the results from the state estimation are used in combination with a parameter estimator. This part not only
focuses on offline batch parameter estimation methods like ordinary least squares (OLS), weighted least squares (WLS),
total least squares (TLS), and maximum likelihood (ML) estimators, but also on recursive parameter estimation methods
like recursive least squares (RLS) that can be used online. Special attention will be paid on the process of choosing
a parameter estimator that is 'right for the job'.

The fourth part of the course introduces an advanced global nonlinear optimization method based on interval analysis.
In aerospace system identification, so-called non-convex and nonlinear optimization problems are often encountered.
Such problems can be solved with global nonlinear optimization methods like interval analysis.

The fifth and sixth part of the course focuses on two advanced model structures that can be used in combination with
the earlier introduced parameter estimation methods. In the fifth part of the course the neural network black-box
function approximator is introduced. It is shown how neural networks are used to approximate scattered multidimensional
data. In the sixth part of the course a new method for aerodynamic model identification based on multivariate simplex
B-splines is introduced. This method was recently developed at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering of the TU-Delft,
and has a number of advantages over existing methods. For example, the simplex B-splines have a transparent model
structure, are general in any number of dimensions, and can be computed efficiently in real-time.

In the final part of the course, all theory introduced in the first six parts is used in a demonstration that uses real
flight data from a real-life system like the Cessna Citation II laboratory aircraft, or a Micro Air Vehicle to identify
a multivariate spline based aerodynamic model. The created model is validated using various techniques. Finally,
pointers are given towards further research in the field of aerodynamic model validation.","After completing the course, students will have a thorough understanding of the theoretical elements of
aircraft system identification. Students will be able to apply these elements to go from real CFD, wind
tunnel, and flight test data to an accurate aerodynamic model that can be used in simulator or flight
control system applications.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35450&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

It controls the orientation and rotational rate of the spacecraft to a required accuracy.

Unlike the flight dynamics in the third educatiioon year, the rotational kinematics of space vehicles in this course is thoroughly taught using quaternion algebra, in order to give a more general technique in modelling spacecraft rotational motion without having mathematical sigularitis. State estimation techniques such as Kalman filter and extended Kalman filter are introduced for estimating spacecraft attitude from attitude sensors. Several techniques in sensor integration and data fusion are also taught for enhancing the performance of the attitude determination system. Control actuators include reaction wheels, momentum biased wheels, thrusters, magnetic coils and Control Moment Gyros (CMGs). The single gimbal CMGs with their applications to spacecraft attitude control is specifically addressed. The course discusses not only the passive attitude control concepts but more dedicates to active attitude control system designs. Particularly the quaternion feedback control technique is enhanced.

"AE4117","Fluid-Structure Interaction","Fluid-Structure interaction is a topic that covers many important and complex problems in engineering where the interaction between the mechanical behaviour of a solid structure is significantly influenced by surrounding fluids (water, air, etc ) and where, in turn, the aero/hydro-dynamic forces are modified by the deformation of the structure. Although it was pioneered by aeronautics engineers to study the static and dynamic deformation of wings under aerodynamic forces (aeroelasticity), fluid-structure interaction analysis involves also the description of interaction phenomenon in constructions (e.g. wind induced vibrations), vibro-acoutics, blood flow in elastic arteries or ink flow in an actuated printer head.

In the past, many semi-analytical approaches were developed to describe fluid-structure interaction. Today, complex problems interaction problems are investigated using engineering codes that couple structural models to fluid models.

"AE4ASM502","Holistic Structural Integrity Process","The courses discusses a Holistic Structural Integrity Process (HolSIP) founded upon the primary idea that all failure mechanisms involved in the degradation of the structure are interconnected and should not be analyzed as merely the sum of individual mechanisms. In reality many failure mechanisms interact synergistically and are much more complex and challenging to understand, and thus the requirement for a holistic physics based analysis and design approach to structural integrity problems. The final goal of this holistic approach is to more accurately assess the reliability and structural integrity of aerospace and wind energy structures while maintaining and achieving higher safety conditions. The course is divided into the following topics:

 Introduction to Holistic Structural Integrity Process (HolSIP): The need for a multi-disciplinary physics based lifing methodology.
 Engineering Failures and the Lessons Learned. This section examines several engineering case studies to illustrate the potential synergistic interaction between failure modes and their catastrophic effects.
 Variability in Initial and In-Service Conditions: This section will examine how variability in part-to-part conditions can affect their life and failure. For initial conditions, the effects of residual stresses, corrosion, wear, creep, and their combination will be examined. For in-service conditions, the variability in usage and resultant loading will be examined.
 HolSIP as an umbrella to: Health Usage Monitoring (HUMS), Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), Prognostic Health Management (PHM) and Condition Based Monitoring Plus (CBM+). This section of the courses puts into context the different terminologies considered today by the scientific community as it relates to Structural Integrity (The word of the day!).
 Direct and indirect measurements of loading spectra: This section of the course would consider the use of sensors (i.e. accelerometers, strain gauges) for determining the bending, moment and shear diagrams for a wing as an example. Indirect measurements techniques such as machine learning algorithms will also be considered.
 Structural Health Monitoring as a damage detection technique: Strain Gauges, Fiber Optics, Piezoelectric Actuators and Sensors (Lamb Wave theory). The course will also highlight the link between the current NDI techniques and their corresponding Probability of Detection (POD) curves in the aerospace industry.
 Future trends in HolSIP.","To provide the students with an overview of a new upcoming structural integrity philosophy and how this one is related to future aerospace and wind energy needs.

"AE4ASM102","Advanced Alloys","In many courses on (physical) metallurgy, students are taught a thermodynamic and other concepts and shown a large number of examples for existing metallic systems. For such courses a strong focus is on knowledge build-up rather than skills build-up.
In contrast, the course AE4X03 aims to give the students hands-on experience in designing new metallic systems themselves, using state of the art thermodynamic software.

The course consists of four lectures summarising the main concepts of thermodyamics (not only for binary alloys, but also for ternary and quaternary alloys), microstrucuture-property relations, casting and solid state processing. Relevant review papers assist the students in mastering the concepts. Each week a homework assignment test is given.

"AE4S06","Spacecraft Mechatronics","Satellites, rovers, rockets and many other technical systems interact with their environment through sensors and actuators that enable to know their environment, take decisions based on this and then influence this environment or move itself to another position. The whole of this can be seen as a mechatronic system in which sensors, actuators, electronics, mechanics and computers work in close cooperation. The design of an mechatronic system requires knowledge of the sensors and actuators that are available and how they are used. Perhaps even more important for modern mechatronic systems is knowing how to decide in which domain the different properties of the system are realized. For example, damping of a robotic arm can be realized via a mechanical damper, via an analog electronic controller that interacts with the mechanical system via acceleration and position sensors and motors, via an control algorithm on a digital processor that reads digitized sensor inputs and controls stepper motors and many other solutions. Each solution has its own advantages and disadvantages and due to the revolutionary innovation in micro mechanical and micro electronic technology the odds of a solution constantly change. This lecture introduces many building blocks for mechatronic systems in space, like optical and magnetic sensors, actuators like motors, solenoids and micromechanical systems, power systems, computers and controllers and their operation and fault mechanisms and EMC.

The motivation for taking an agent-based approach to safety risk analysis of such novel operation is twofold:
1. The socio-technical system nature of the air traffic system; by its very nature air traffic involves interaction between multiple pilots, controllers, procedures and technical systems which are highly distributed.
2. Multiple time scale nature of air traffic safety: Although safety can be defined in terms of very rare events (i.e. flight accidents), its realization depends of activities happening at multiple other time scales.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35371&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

compressible flows, including the design of discontinuity-capturing
schemes and approaches to higher-order upwinding using finite volumes
and finite elements. Then the computation of turbulent flows is
discussed including direct numerical simulation, both filter-based and
variational-multiscale large-eddy simulation, and techniques based on
Reynolds averaging.

advanced time-marching techniques are described and analysed.

predictive accuracy. We catalogue errors that are made in the effort
to simulate physical phenomena, and thereafter methods to quantify
these errors and in some cases reduce them. For this we develop tools
including: uncertainty quantification (UQ), a posteriori error
estimation, stochastic model updating and data assimilation. By
employing probabilistic models to represent our unknowns, reliable
predictions of reality can be made.","At the end of the course the student should be familiar with the computational challenges and techniques associated with compressible flows and turbulence, and understand the key concepts of sophisticated time-integration methods, uncertainty quantification, error estimation stochastic model updating and data assimilation.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35339&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"

"AE4130","Aircraft Aerodynamics","The first part of the course deals with boundary layer theory; focusing on the practical application in low speed flows. Topics are: the laminar boundary layer, the transition process, the turbulent boundary layer, laminar and turbulent flow separation, the separation bubble, lift and drag. The second part of the course starts with general information on drag, useful for the aerodynamic design of aircraft. The course continues with the analysis and design of single and multi-component airfoils, illustrated by examples of CFD analyses and windtunnel experiments. Special topics like winglets, high lift systems, flow control an propeller propulsion will be treated as well. Aerodynamic analysis and design codes will be demonstrated during the course.","The course is designed to provide the student with the basic theoretical and experimental tools for the aerodynamic design of aircraft. At the end the student will be able to apply some usefull design codes and CFD tools.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35340&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"AE4115","Experimental Simulations","Experimental simulation (in aeronautics) deals with the systematic approach required to design and perform good experiments simulating flight. It looks at the deficiencies of scaling real flight into a ground testing simulation and defines the validity of simplifications required for testing. Particular attention is given to the simulation of aircraft propulsion and noise generation in ground testing facilities.","At the end of this course, the student will be able to:
- reduce a simulation challenge to its dominant non-dimensional scaling parameters
- identify the necessary hardware required for ground based testing of the identified parameters
- Identify the measurement techniques capable of obtaining data from the simulation
- plan an efficient program of simulation and data acquisition for the treatment of the identified phenomena","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35336&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
"AE4020","Literature Study","The Literature Study is an individual assignment that prepares for the thesis research project. The Literature Study aims the student to familiarise with the subject of the thesis research project and apply the research skills that are acquired in course AE4010 Research Methodologies.

You practice the concept of:
* Setting up a research plan for the Literature Study and possibly the Thesis research project
* Formulating the research question and research aim.
* Writing a literature review, based on the research plan
* Doing systematic research","The goals of the literature study are twofold:
* Obtain an accurate overview of the state-of-the-art in the field of your MSc thesis research. This helps you to identify the most interesting and relevant questions in this field and prevents you from re-inventing the wheel.
* Learn to formulate a clear problem definition, become familiar with all sources of information (internet, library, courses) and their quality, get a clear overview of methods and theories in the field of research, and last but not least write a report with the style and quality of an MSc thesis.","http://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=35335&&SIS_SwitchLang=en"
